1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
It's destroyed.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.010
It gets fucking jacked.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.260
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is a special Sunday edition of the Joe Rogan

4
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.340
experience podcast.

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.940
And we wouldn't even be doing this shit if it wasn't for Jim Gaffigan.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.600
Jim Gaffigan is hilarious and awesome and uh,

7
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.400
and we will talk about him later,

8
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.040
but right now let's talk about rubber vaginas cause we're sponsored by the

9
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:20.640
fleshlight.

10
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.941
Oh,

11
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:22.070
Shalane Alaykum.

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.221
Is it good?

13
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:24.030
Yes it is.

14
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.960
Is it embarrassing?

15
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:25.651
Fuck yet.

16
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.690
As you got to make your choices in this life,

17
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.524
you've got to pick your,

18
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.281
pick your ground.

19
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.540
You got to stand down.

20
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.000
Sometimes you got to stand up for what you believe in.

21
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.380
And if you masturbate,

22
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.310
this is better than that.

23
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.650
This is on the Christian Broadcasting Network,

24
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:37.880
right?

25
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.340
Yes.

26
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.850
Yes.

27
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.031
Well,

28
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:40.020
the Internet side of it,

29
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.981
it's really different.

30
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.210
It's diametrically opposed.

31
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:45.840
It's like the econ before Pat Robertson or af during the background.

32
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.860
Subliminal.

33
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.910
He's under my desk right now.

34
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.930
Can we do it like hungry?

35
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.764
Eat Popcorn?

36
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.770
Pat Robertson just came out and said that marijuana should be legal.

37
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:53.604
It's then amazing.

38
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.380
Makes you want to stop smoking pot.

39
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.770
That's what was it?

40
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.640
ABS like?

41
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.680
He's crazy though.

42
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.373
We knew he was,

43
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.040
we knew he was crazy before he even ran for president,

44
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.210
and now he's like,

45
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.650
a pot should be legal.

46
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.650
It's like the Christians are sitting there going,

47
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.783
you know,

48
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.040
I can deal with rush calling that Georgetown law student a slut,

49
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:18.390
but pod legal,

50
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.040
you know,

51
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.450
or he's just gone so crazy that he's saying he completely went around like that

52
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:24.840
dude.

53
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.200
Then,

54
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.630
uh,

55
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.180
what was that movie with the mathematician?

56
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.190
Brilliant madness.

57
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.053
Is that what it was?

58
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.930
Brilliant mind.

59
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.763
Brilliant mind,

60
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.640
brilliant mind.

61
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.930
Remember that he worried,

62
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.470
he learned,

63
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.400
turned around,

64
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.380
turned around and became sane,

65
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.180
but so crazy became sane.

66
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.750
Anyway,

67
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.710
go to Joburg and.net.

68
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.290
Click on the link for the fleshlight entering the code.

69
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.420
Ne Rogan save 15% off the number one sex toys for men.

70
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.110
You know,

71
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.580
if you're buying a a sex,

72
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:48.301
do I for yourself?

73
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:53.301
What you're looking for is to say 15% and yet the number one you want.

74
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:55.440
I don't know that everybody else is fucking as well.

75
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.200
You don't want to be a trailblazer.

76
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.680
And then the sex toy world.

77
00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.191
You want to know?

78
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.030
This is the one that's,

79
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.500
people bought it again.

80
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.200
Yeah,

81
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.860
they get,

82
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.110
you get like a six pack of them.

83
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.020
Bloggers doesn't have a Baker's dozen.

84
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.200
We're also sponsored by [inaudible] Dot com o n n I t,

85
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.560
makers of alphabet.

86
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.910
It's a cognitive enhancing sub supplements.

87
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.810
I got entropic.

88
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.430
I got a new catchphrase for on it by the way.

89
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:20.970
I go for it.

90
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.900
Get up on it.

91
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.870
You remember like that olds that get up on it,

92
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.620
grab it like you want it?

93
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.820
I don't even remember that,

94
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:28.020
but I don't remember liking it.

95
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.360
The same people that did

96
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.960
back off or had a headache off.

97
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.083
No.

98
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.431
No.

99
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:35.821
What does it,

100
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.654
what was that?

101
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.430
Was that something to cure hangovers?

102
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.180
Do you guys know what I'm talking about and was like go remedies.

103
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.481
Yeah,

104
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:43.314
it was a nerve boat,

105
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.161
but it was,

106
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:44.730
it was.

107
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.540
It was a,

108
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.910
that sounds like it's a real,

109
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.351
well,

110
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:49.710
what will the Alpha brain is,

111
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:50.341
is a,

112
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:51.390
it's a nootropic.

113
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.590
Nootropics are,

114
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:56.310
is there a certain vitamins and nutrients that have been proven to have a

115
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:58.100
benefit on thinking on,

116
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.480
on,

117
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.620
on the way?

118
00:02:59.621 --> 00:02:59.931
Yeah.

119
00:02:59.931 --> 00:02:59.990
And

120
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.050
<v 1>then your brain's production of neurotransmitters.</v>

121
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.880
It's a very controversial science.

122
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.481
And,

123
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:04.600
uh,

124
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.530
we're actually running,

125
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.610
I'm a part of the company,

126
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.790
we're running double blind placebo.

127
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 0>I always thought the diversity of biologist,</v>

128
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.223
<v 1>no nothing.</v>

129
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.861
I can't even,

130
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.080
can't even repeat what they say correctly.

131
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.891
I fucked that up.

132
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.510
But the guy who,

133
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.080
uh,

134
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.420
I'm working with is organizing this whole thing.

135
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.351
What it is,

136
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:23.841
is there's a,

137
00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:26.100
there's a bunch of different vitamins and not just our company.

138
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.771
I always tell people,

139
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.710
if you're interested in,

140
00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:28.541
in this stuff at all,

141
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.290
just please Google the word nootropic and read all the pros and cons.

142
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:32.461
And it's,

143
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:33.310
it's fascinating stuff,

144
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.290
but essentially it's not gonna kill you.

145
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.430
It's vitamins for your brain.

146
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.180
And you know,

147
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.260
like a lot of things,

148
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.150
some people have weird allergies and some people have weird reactions to certain

149
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:43.391
things.

150
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.040
Some people die if ate peanuts,

151
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.430
you know,

152
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.550
the human body's not called the same people.

153
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.310
Is that what it is?

154
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.210
Does that how you feel about it?

155
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.440
You are blonde,

156
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.510
<v 0>they wouldn't died.</v>

157
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.130
They wouldn't have made it through little house on the prairie.

158
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.611
I mean,

159
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:56.440
you know a lot of people weren't making it through there.

160
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:58.060
But like if you're allergic to peanuts,

161
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.500
it is a sad one.

162
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.410
I don't want to alienate the peanut allergic people.

163
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.090
I looked at people they were allergic to wheat.

164
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.110
That's,

165
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.400
that's really common apparently.

166
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.710
Yeah,

167
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.890
it's you know,

168
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.710
it's,

169
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.543
yeah,

170
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.820
it's like what's next?

171
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.260
I'm allergic to air.

172
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.590
There was a movie about that boy in the plastic bubble or something.

173
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.520
That little hamster ball.

174
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.250
So I'm just trying to get through here.

175
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.660

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.120
There's a bunch of different supplements that they sell.

179
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.110
There is not just Alpha brain but shroom tech sport,

180
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.040
which is the uh,

181
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.180
the endurance supplement,

182
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.680
a shroom tech immune,

183
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.341
all this stuff.

184
00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:41.151
It will be answered at,

185

187
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.910
We have a specialist

188
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.190
<v 0>Sunday,</v>

189
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:48.830
Sunday.

190
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.663
Remember those

191
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.320
monster truck guy?

192
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.580
Not to be confused with Strip club Dj guy there,

193
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.760
their cousins,

194
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.540
right.

195
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.270
I think they're related a little bit.

196
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.420
Is that the music we you in it commit didn't barely commit.

197
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.300
We operate in the background.

198
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.300
I don't know what the hell that was.

199
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.840
<v 2>Ghost train by day Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

200
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.130
<v 0>You did it again with the reverb.</v>

201
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:19.970
You fucking freak.

202
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.090
Strange man.

203
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.090
This Brian red band,

204
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.200
very odd character.

205
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.490
Unlike Jim Gaffigan.

206
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.010
Looks like a serial killer sitting behind.

207
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.310
Well,

208
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.260
we just got back from a tie.

209
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.300
We just got back from a music video.

210
00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:33.560
He never dresses like this.

211
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.970
Never.

212
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.180
We both music video.

213
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.391
Yeah.

214
00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:37.070
We both usually dress like children.

215
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.053
Yeah,

216
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.170
children.

217
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.411
Yeah.

218
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.610
We were in the back row.

219
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:41.660
It was a bar scene.

220
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.820
Brian and I were holding hands and dancing.

221
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:44.654
Slow dancing.

222
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.873
Not really.

223
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.560
Now we're thinking about doing that,

224
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:49.191
but there were like,

225
00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:49.730
no,

226
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.020
maybe you should just practice it.

227
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.640
It comes up.

228
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.920
I ain't,

229
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.690
come on.

230
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.321
Come on man.

231
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:56.920
Come on.

232
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.140
Lens.

233
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.090
Lie Down and cuddle the,

234
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.990
there's like a scene where we're supposed to cuddle.

235
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.610
How many guys do you want to be an actor or not?

236
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.110
Listen to want to be an actor.

237
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:07.100
You gotta be ready 24,

238
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.790
seven to act.

239
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.920
You do I want you to act like you want to suck my Dick.

240
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.390
I mean,

241
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.980
not in a gay way.

242
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.530
I have to look at pictures of myself confusing.

243
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:18.980
Right?

244
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.250
Yeah.

245
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.330
He's constantly doing that.

246
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.520
That's what the American public sees right now.

247
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.511
Jim Gaffigan,

248
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:24.890
is it also international?

249
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.580
Uh,

250
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.821
yeah.

251
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.630
The world gets it.

252
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.463
The world.

253
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.060
We're not douchey.

254
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.460
We don't keep our friends overseas from getting the feed.

255
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:31.641
No.

256
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.200
Communists are watching this though.

257
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.531
Well,

258
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.910
we would hope that there,

259
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.230
they would learn something from this.

260
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.100
Jim Gaffigan,

261
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.600
maybe I'll come out of their shell.

262
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.340
You remember if you ever watched that?

263
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:40.551
A,

264
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:40.971
what was it?

265
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:41.690
Uh,

266
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.010
was it the Robert Deniro who starred in that movie about communism in the,

267
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.300
in Hollywood in the 1950s and how crazy it was.

268
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.350
Did you ever see that movie?

269
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.160
I think I,

270
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.640
I think I know what you're talking about.

271
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.440
It was during the McCarthy era where they were just accusing everybody being a

272
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.100
catalyst.

273
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.470
Yeah.

274
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.100
Yeah.

275
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.730
Yes.

276
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.170
And that was kind of like,

277
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.820
that's what prompted the play,

278
00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.690
the crucible,

279
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.760
which was the witch hunt.

280
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.023
Yeah.

281
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.741
Amazing.

282
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:04.120
Right?

283
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.820
Yeah.

284
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.040
It's kind of hard to believe that that existed,

285
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.341
you know,

286
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:07.701
just,

287
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:07.971
I mean,

288
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.870
in 1950 so it's really not that long ago they were like,

289
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.240
but on after communists events,

290
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.120
I don't think that,

291
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.920
I think that's happening all the time.

292
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.780
There's just larger examples of it.

293
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.570
You think like blackballing you see happening all the time?

294
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:21.404
Is that what you mean?

295
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.490
Fit?

296
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.910
We have a tendency to a a paranoia I sure do.

297
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.863
You know what I mean?

298
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.151
Yeah,

299
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:28.510
definitely.

300
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.780
You know the,

301
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.280
you know,

302
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.880
the Arabs in this country or Muslims had to go through some shit because I think

303
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.560
right after nine 11 people were like,

304
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.663
Huh,

305
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.941
you're,

306
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:38.211
I mean,

307
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:39.590
I'm not talking about just the idiot.

308
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.530
Like Sikhs had to go through a lot of shit.

309
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:42.810
Yeah.

310
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.700
Guys who are Indian,

311
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:44.610
they have a real problem.

312
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:44.931
I mean,

313
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:45.770
it's so ignorant.

314
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:48.230
It's like you're not even talking about the same continent.

315
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:49.100
You silly people.

316
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.993
I know,

317
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.480
I know.

318
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.900
It's,

319
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.300
I dunno,

320
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.790
it's,

321
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.070
I,

322
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.430
I,

323
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.440
I didn't deal with any of that.

324
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.820
Skated right through didn't,

325
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.820
I didn't deal with any,

326
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.550
not even a little nothing,

327
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.623
but people didn't even know.

328
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.570
They didn't think I was Muslim at all.

329
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.390
Yeah.

330
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.870
Do you think that there's a backlash?

331
00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:07.704
Should be a Muslim?

332
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.770
I don't think there is if you're like,

333
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.760
I think if you were like a Muslim act,

334
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.660
like it wasn't there like a Muslim act on lost and it was kind of a cool part of

335
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:19.180
his personality really.

336
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.040
I remember that was like kind of a cool part of his personality.

337
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.550
Like I think there's been representation,

338
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:29.480
so I think for sure the majority opinion is people are scared,

339
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:31.370
jihad is suicide bombers,

340
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.180
all that stuff.

341
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.310
But I think more now than ever,

342
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:38.900
you get a little bit of a positive perspective on,

343
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.831
on uh,

344
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:41.780
on Muslims and Arabs.

345
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.120
No,

346
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.280
not,

347
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:42.950
they're not,

348
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.330
you can't call him the same thing.

349
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.650
Like the guy from lost,

350
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:46.484
like he was like,

351
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.320
it was a positive character is a bad ass.

352
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:48.470
My,

353
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.660
well,

354
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.500
he played a guy who tortured people in Iraq.

355
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.453
He's a bad ass.

356
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.500
I'm still liked him.

357
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.400
I liked the really interesting story,

358
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.490
but he did like tortured and killed people.

359
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.260
It was fascinating how that was like a part of his life and that she was shamed

360
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:04.780
by it,

361
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.220
you know,

362
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.580
later,

363
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.780
and it really fucked with them.

364
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.140
That was,

365
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.610
that was a great character.

366
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.840
That was amazing.

367
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.150
Yeah.

368
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.220
That was a great character.

369
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.120
That mood,

370
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.800
that show was for the longest time,

371
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.210
one of the greatest shows of all time.

372
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.691
The end.

373
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.090
I didn't really get at the end of it if it seemed like everybody was just

374
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.110
walking through the motions.

375
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.790
The last few episodes I quit shot.

376
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.090
Yeah.

377
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.390
Oh,

378
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.223
I thought you said

379
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.263
no one watched it.

380
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.090
Paid for it on iTunes.

381
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:30.361
Yeah,

382
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.081
I did as well.

383
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:32.220
I even have the DVDs,

384
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:32.911
which I never bought.

385
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:33.744
I got the blue rays.

386
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.680
It's the greatest,

387
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.820
one of the greatest shows of all time,

388
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.520
but no matter who you are,

389
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.760
I'm going to get how creative you are when you're doing a crazy fucking show

390
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:46.140
where people were allowed to travel back in time and do all kinds of nutty shit

391
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.330
from this magical island.

392
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.520
It doesn't even exist when you're doing something like that.

393
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:50.370
And after a while,

394
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:50.581
man,

395
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:51.660
you got to run dry.

396
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.560
It must be exhausting trying to think of nutty shit that you're going to do on

397
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.490
this fucking island.

398
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.120
Yeah.

399
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.970
I mean it's,

400
00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.310
it's,

401
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.900
it's gotta be amazing to also kind of tie it together with some semblance of

402
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:04.734
logic.

403
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.311
All right,

404
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:06.660
so we're going to go back in time.

405
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.830
What would happen if we went back in time but we still want that one character

406
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:11.664
in there.

407
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.750
So they had to Deb weird shit to like remember they had polar bears in the

408
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.390
beginning and then they stopped having polar bears.

409
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:19.160
Yeah,

410
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.380
they just disappeared right there.

411
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:24.220
Was that that foot that had like four yeah,

412
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.203
the statue.

413
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.240
And then they started going forward in time member when Jack like had a beard

414
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:31.950
and they were sitting on that bridge and they were like,

415
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.523
what happened?

416
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.800
Great God damn show.

417
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.160
Especially considering it head to operate within the parameters of an ABC

418
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:39.180
primetime show.

419
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.010
It's insane.

420
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.350
Yeah.

421
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.981
It's amazing.

422
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:41.814
I Dunno how

423
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.300
I got the hardest job in the world.

424
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.450
I don't think shows like that really would have a shot.

425
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.580
Yeah.

426
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:49.890
You know,

427
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.461
homelands.

428
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:51.294
A good show.

429
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.970
I gave up after lost.

430
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.913
You did.

431
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.790
You just don't watch television.

432
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.170
I don't watch anything on the show.

433
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:00.450
Ended real through your flat screen out the window.

434
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.620
Elvis to TV.

435
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.710
I uh,

436
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.543
I only watch,

437
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.531
that's it.

438
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:05.890
I'm done throwing and watch.

439
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.201
It's not a good thing.

440
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.040
It's not any virtue.

441
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:09.270
Like watch bigfoot hunter.

442
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:11.100
I watched fucking two episodes.

443
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.470
I had DVRd fid,

444
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.270
hunter finding big foot or something.

445
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.060
And it's like a series where they have like more than one episode.

446
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.190
The first episode they'll be like,

447
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:20.371
yeah,

448
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:21.240
we're not going to find them.

449
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:21.851
Well,

450
00:11:21.851 --> 00:11:22.684
it's tough.

451
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:22.950
No.

452
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.360
The best part about it is the beginning of the guys I've been hunting Sasquatch

453
00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:27.720
is for 25 years,

454
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.890
I'll quit now.

455
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.700
Quit.

456
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.030
Quit now you haven't even got a video of one and crazy ass.

457
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:33.864
Hell was like,

458
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.231
you know,

459
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:34.531
it's like,

460
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:34.711
hey,

461
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:34.990
you know,

462
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.020
those go shows are really not realistic.

463
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.750
Like they never really find a ghost if we did it with that.

464
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.611
What's next?

465
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:43.170
Like Tuba cobre sure.

466
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.520
If they can sell it,

467
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.850
they would,

468
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.630
they would have it.

469
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:45.931
It's a,

470
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.150
it's a fun show to watch though because it's so stupid.

471
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.080
I mean,

472
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.591
first of all,

473
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:51.600
everyone has a video that they want you to analyze.

474
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:52.710
It may have been a Sasquatch,

475
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.730
so they to recreate the scene in the video.

476
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.573
It looks,

477
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.710
it looks so silly because the people knew exact where the car was and this is

478
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:00.311
the tree.

479
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.490
And so they line it up on the camera and then they have this big guy named Bobo

480
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.610
who kind of looks like a big foot and he goes out there and he does exactly

481
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:06.760
what,

482
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.090
and he's always way bigger than the big foot in the video.

483
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.280
So it always proves that it wasn't really a big thing as what I do right now.

484
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.291
Oh,

485
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.050
I see here you were big foot yet I was pig foot a,

486
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.820
season one and season two they replace me.

487
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.850
There was like a contract.

488
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.000
I want it to make us more empathetic.

489
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:28.250
And Harry and the Hendersons like a whole family lived with bigfoot.

490
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.960
You know,

491
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.793
why not?

492
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.510
She imagined herself.

493
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:36.430
These are my kids.

494
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:37.180
I'm pretty sure.

495
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.890
I don't even trust dogs that I don't know.

496
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.650
This guy's gonna fucking big foot hanging out with his kids.

497
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.700
He probably told these stupid humans a thing or two about love.

498
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.720
I hurry and the Henderson,

499
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.370
there's never been a real good big foot movie.

500
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:55.204
How about that?

501
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.660
Nobody has ever stepped up and it's not like

502
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.590
the bar's been set that high.

503
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.600
The bar is incredibly low.

504
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:06.670
The bar is all fraudulent videos.

505
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.300
That's the closest thing to a big foot movement I would've think after like

506
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:13.180
season one there's a lot of people that watch the show and they're like,

507
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:13.920
why not?

508
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.400
Like I think you should submit

509
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:17.950
them.

510
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.750
There's ever been,

511
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.090
there's,

512
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.020
I mean there was a like this is a really bad ones in the 70s or some swamp

513
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.591
thing,

514
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:24.550
monster guy,

515
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.400
but there's never been a movie,

516
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:29.980
a good movie about a bunch of people that encounter big foot.

517
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.340
Why?

518
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.420
How is it possible that you have such a a folklore that it's completely

519
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:35.470
permeated society?

520
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:37.680
He's not that no one's ever made not sexy.

521
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.810
I made a movie about finding bigfoot.

522
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.650
That's amazing.

523
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.483
That's true.

524
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.211
That's incredible.

525
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:43.481
We're really,

526
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:45.340
when you think about how popular it is,

527
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.010
you would think that movie would be humor.

528
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.550
The movie ideas they're doing,

529
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:49.384
they're just,

530
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.370
it's like based on a matchbook.

531
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.671
Yeah.

532
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:55.450
Like you'd think they'd have big photo romantic comedies.

533
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:58.270
When you hear some romantic comedy premise and you're like,

534
00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:58.900
what?

535
00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.770
I don't understand.

536
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:02.260
Finally meet again at 16.

537
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.020
I sometimes feel like I just established consciousness when I was like 30

538
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.400
because like romantic comedies,

539
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:10.420
like I,

540
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:10.720
you know,

541
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.590
I was so dumb I think in my twenties that like when,

542
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.111
you know,

543
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:14.710
it'd be like,

544
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.543
uh,

545
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.600
uh,

546
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.170
you know,

547
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.270
Meg Ryan and Billy crystal,

548
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:19.511
you know,

549
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:20.590
like Harry met Sally.

550
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.090
Like to me that one's just a movie.

551
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:24.010
I didn't consider that a romantic comedy,

552
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:24.791
which it was,

553
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:29.140
but now it's like this genre that is always existed,

554
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:30.280
but they just kind of like,

555
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:31.570
just churn out these,

556
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.050
just like those didn't exist.

557
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.720
It's romantic code existed.

558
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.520
Movies where when a woman got mouthy,

559
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.940
the man gave him the back of her hand back of his hand.

560
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.223
Right.

561
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.490
That's what they used to do to the moon.

562
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:42.791
Alice.

563
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:43.180
Yeah.

564
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.451
Yeah.

565
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:44.284
All that stuff.

566
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.490
That was really good old days.

567
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.810
Billy Crystal fucked us.

568
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.310
Billy Crystal fucked up,

569
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.940
fucked us in the area.

570
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.740
He tried be,

571
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.000
he tried to be manly.

572
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.710
They tried to like be the best.

573
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.760
Oh,

574
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.750
that example.

575
00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.180
And then he caved that or sleep disturbance because I see,

576
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.230
so you see when Harry met Sally,

577
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.041
Harry met.

578
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:04.880
Sally is like,

579
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.990
it's like a sad ending to you.

580
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.491
You're like,

581
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.324
you know what?

582
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:11.931
You're like hip.

583
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:12.764
There you go.

584
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.980
The relationship seems like so much work.

585
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.810
I'm never happy with the relationship.

586
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.570
That seems like so much work works out cause I don't buy it.

587
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.433
I'm not buying it.

588
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.390
I'm saying she gets going to last you guys.

589
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.180
There's a lot of people in relationships.

590
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:28.010
You just think that they're all acting.

591
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:28.341
You're like,

592
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:29.174
wow,

593
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.140
no one cared this.

594
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.030
Everyone has been in good and bad relationships.

595
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:35.751
That's not what I'm saying.

596
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:36.310
I'm saying when you,

597
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.880
when one is a battle,

598
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.450
one is a crazy battle of payment.

599
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:39.740
Sally.

600
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.110
Oh yeah,

601
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.900
no where they have nothing in common.

602
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.370
It's like we hate each other.

603
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.630
We don't get along.

604
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.120
But we got drunk one night and made out.

605
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.610
So maybe we should get married is akin to the point.

606
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.420
Uh,

607
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:50.830
you know,

608
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.830
I'm 44.

609
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.790
How old are you?

610
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.623
21.

611
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.523
You look great.

612
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.600
These are getting to a point where you look at like older married folks and you

613
00:15:59.601 --> 00:15:59.751
know,

614
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:00.260
like that,

615
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
that are just barely into each other,

616
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.110
barely can communicate with each other and you look at it and you go,

617
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:07.310
I could see how that can happen.

618
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.613
I Dunno not,

619
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.180
I don't yet see how it can happen.

620
00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:12.590
Right.

621
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.860
There's nothing normal about what,

622
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.460
uh,

623
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.630
we do your,

624
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.730
I mean like I think at some of those married couples,

625
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.410
it's like I do everything with my wife.

626
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:22.550
So it's not as if,

627
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.560
you know,

628
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:24.940
the,

629
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.710
the conversation where like there's science silent man.

630
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:28.010
Like,

631
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:28.970
don't talk to me,

632
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.953
Virginia,

633
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.240
you don't like where they don't let your wife talk cause that we try and say

634
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:32.630
I'm,

635
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.100
you know,

636
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.501
yes.

637
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:35.240
On Tuesday she's allowed to talk.

638
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:36.590
No,

639
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.180
but there's that complete communication back breakdown.

640
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.590
I Dunno.

641
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.880
That's the only reason to be married,

642
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.721
in my opinion.

643
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:47.540
The only way you should ever let me other than children.

644
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.880
And that'll of course kind of goes with the whole package.

645
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:52.370
If that sort of relationship that like it really intense relationship that's

646
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:53.310
homophobic of you.

647
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.140
Thank you.

648
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.140
But the only reason why you should be,

649
00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:56.421
you know,

650
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:58.130
is because you feel like that that's it.

651
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.881
And if you don't,

652
00:16:58.881 --> 00:16:59.960
if it's anything less,

653
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:00.860
it's not easy.

654
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.141
I know.

655
00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:01.980
It's definitely money.

656
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.833
Get your own shit.

657
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.610
This is a,

658
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.660
this is too hard.

659
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.700
But that's what horse before.

660
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.380
That's why,

661
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.060
of course.

662
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.470
No,

663
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.260
that's what,

664
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:10.940
that's what,

665
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.181
you know,

666
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:12.770
you gotta suck it up.

667
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:13.950
You got to go long term.

668
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.180
You know,

669
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.290
it's like standup comedy,

670
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.281
you know,

671
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:16.611
I don't know.

672
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:18.490
Maybe you probably did.

673
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:18.891
All right.

674
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:19.490
But you know,

675
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.630
a lot of nights where you just eat,

676
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.700
oh I eat there.

677
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.670
But your commitment,

678
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.670
you've made the commission.

679
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.580
Remember when,

680
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:25.791
yeah,

681
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:26.624
that's terrifying.

682
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.140
Quit,

683
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.980
quit comedy.

684
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:28.941
And they'd be like,

685
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:29.451
I'm quitting.

686
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.620
And you'd look at them and he'd go,

687
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.330
I don't think I could ever quit.

688
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.901
I mean,

689
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:33.950
I really feel that way.

690
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:34.784
It's like,

691
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.020
this is not something like,

692
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:36.201
you know,

693
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:36.951
I'll try this.

694
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:38.300
And then maybe I'll try archery.

695
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:38.931
It's like,

696
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:40.850
it's not like I had a choice in this.

697
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.733
It's like I,

698
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.600
I was resigned to be like the weird old uncle.

699
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:47.360
I didn't think that when you're constantly making people laugh,

700
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:47.990
like you are like,

701
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.561
did you even just,

702
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:49.394
we're having this,

703
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.030
all the three of us,

704
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.550
there's that feeling that you get when you laughing really hard.

705
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:54.240
It's something we,

706
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.021
all of our brains,

707
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:56.050
like we're,

708
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.030
it's just like a real energy that goes off when you're really laughing hard at

709
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:00.540
something.

710
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.730
People fucking love that.

711
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.691
You love it.

712
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:04.261
They love it.

713
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.190
You love to do it.

714
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:06.930
It's one of the most fun things to be able to do,

715
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:08.400
to do that to a whole room full of people,

716
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.200
people to go out and see it.

717
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:11.880
It's one of the most fun things for them to see.

718
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.013
Why would you,

719
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.950
why would you quit?

720
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.783
What are you doing?

721
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:16.650
It's,

722
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.150
it's an absolute heroin,

723
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:18.511
right?

724
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:20.670
Going on and being able to,

725
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:21.031
you know,

726
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:21.480
make,

727
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.290
uh,

728
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.020
a crowd laugh or just coming up with a new joke.

729
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.651
And by the way,

730
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:29.730
I feel like it's also a responsibility because there's Jim Gaffigan fans out

731
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:33.390
there and you got them addicted to Jim Gaffigan humor and you've got to keep

732
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:33.780
coming.

733
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.770
You've got to keep showing up,

734
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:35.600
you've got to keep touring,

735
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.450
you got to keep coming to them.

736
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:37.470
They want to come see you again.

737
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.013
<v 3>It's also,</v>

738
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.650
you know,

739
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.770
even though I think fan is,

740
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.210
I mean I that that's a different to weird word.

741
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.070
I think it's a weird word particularly for me,

742
00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:51.050
but I think it's also really important to like do well you're,

743
00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:51.770
I mean,

744
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.603
not,

745
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.000
not,

746
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.211
not,

747
00:18:53.211 --> 00:18:54.044
sorry.

748
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.831
Well,

749
00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:55.221
you know,

750
00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:55.730
with,

751
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.240
you know,

752
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.600
if,

753
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.280
if people are paying 30 bucks,

754
00:18:58.281 --> 00:18:59.840
it's like they better leave.

755
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:00.920
Like if they don't leave going,

756
00:19:00.921 --> 00:19:01.640
that was great.

757
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.473
Yeah,

758
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.523
you're fucked up.

759
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.600
<v 0>Some of my most inspirational moments in comedy have been from reading a review</v>

760
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:10.110
of someone who said that like,

761
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.351
oh,

762
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.390
I thought it was boring or I didn't like it.

763
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.230
You know?

764
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.711
And I've,

765
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.570
I've read those before and even if you know,

766
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.760
it's just one douche bag,

767
00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:18.180
like sometimes it just makes you like,

768
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.190
just that anybody could think like that.

769
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.480
I have to stop that.

770
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.110
And you can,

771
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.790
you might not like the subject matter.

772
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:24.210
You might.

773
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.200
But if anybody thinks that it wasn't a good show and then I need to fix whatever

774
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:29.034
the fuck that is.

775
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.610
<v 3>It's interesting because there's also,</v>

776
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.910
there's the new material police.

777
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.843
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

778
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.950
Which is hard in the,

779
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.800
which is kind of,

780
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.701
it's,

781
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:40.620
it's painful but it's also good.

782
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.483
It's kind of like,

783
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:41.870
you know,

784
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.451
people are like wow,

785
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:42.691
you know,

786
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:46.950
like 75 79% of the show was new,

787
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.093
you know,

788
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.430
and then there's some people like you could do like a,

789
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.090
you know,

790
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.080
45 minutes new and do like 15 minutes old and they're like,

791
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:56.730
it was all old material.

792
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.121
And you're like,

793
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:59.190
what about the first 45 minutes?

794
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.630
People will definitely do that.

795
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.800
And I like hearing like Joey Diaz has some jokes I could hear over and over and

796
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:05.634
over again.

797
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.930
I want to hear some,

798
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.390
like when I go to see a guy and you know,

799
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:12.150
he's a guy that I would seen over the last year or two.

800
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.370
I don't mind seeing those jokes over and over again.

801
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:17.730
I certainly don't expect and a year that he's going to have a whole new act

802
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.560
unless he just puts something out.

803
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:23.610
And that's the crazy when you're about to do that right now you do the same

804
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:23.791
thing.

805
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:25.610
You toss everything out and then you start fresh.

806
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.563
<v 3>I,</v>

807
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.220
you know,

808
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.491
yeah.

809
00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:30.170
I mean when I'm in New York,

810
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:30.771
but you know,

811
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:31.970
if I'm doing a theater,

812
00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:36.020
I think the most important thing is to try and make it half knew at least,

813
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.500
but also make sure that it's a really good show.

814
00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:42.350
So there is something about like,

815
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:43.520
I don't want to,

816
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.040
I don't want people cause you,

817
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.591
like you said,

818
00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:46.910
some people want to hear the old,

819
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.640
but is that weird thing though?

820
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.040
Like a week ago it was all new.

821
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.020
It was like 75 minutes new.

822
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.070
But,

823
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.850
uh,

824
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.181
and I,

825
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:55.421
you know,

826
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.760
I have stuff that I didn't put in this,

827
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:58.031
you know,

828
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:59.110
like maybe 20 minutes.

829
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:04.111
So I'll start over with that 20 minutes and kind of throw stuff out.

830
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:06.730
But like when I'm doing a show,

831
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:07.151
it's like,

832
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:08.710
it's got to be boom,

833
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.573
it's gotta be both.

834
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.090
Yeah.

835
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.601
You know what I mean?

836
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:12.010
You got a lot of people come and see you live though.

837
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.270
Mine might be like boom.

838
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:15.940
Yeah,

839
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.600
but I love,

840
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.321
I think,

841
00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:17.711
I'm sorry,

842
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:18.580
I'm not going to let you talk.

843
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.610
But I think that that's what's so amazing about,

844
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:21.821
you know,

845
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:23.710
like we're making each other laugh here,

846
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:28.120
but like that's some of why podcasts are so fun.

847
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.850
It's like comedians want to talk to other comedians.

848
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:32.440
We just don't have the opportunity.

849
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:33.963
And so,

850
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.930
you know,

851
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.880
getting the opportunity to do something like this,

852
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:37.480
you're like,

853
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:37.931
well yeah,

854
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:38.141
no,

855
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:39.220
I'd love to talk to Joe.

856
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.173
You know what I mean?

857
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.530
And you were so nice cause I asked to do it that I'm really excited that you're

858
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:47.170
doing the you're special the same way Louis Ck did it.

859
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.850
You're going to release it completely,

860
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.091
uh,

861
00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:51.010
on the Internet with the same price.

862
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:52.210
I think Louis kind of established it,

863
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:52.810
right?

864
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.351
Five bucks.

865
00:21:53.351 --> 00:21:54.370
I'm going to do the same thing.

866
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.410
Yeah.

867
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.290
I think it's,

868
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.190
it's uh,

869
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.173
you know,

870
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.420
Louise not the first person to sell something on the Internet,

871
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.880
but I think he figured it out.

872
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.230
A real simple thing.

873
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:06.580
It's like you keep it as cheap,

874
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.110
you keep it cheap.

875
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:11.350
$5 is not going to kill anyone and then you keep,

876
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:16.351
make it really easy to buy and then you're just honest and a good,

877
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.050
you know,

878
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.390
people were looking forward to seeing Louis stuff cause,

879
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.961
and you know,

880
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:22.310
Louise is the guy that in my opinion is the,

881
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.860
the most prolific I think.

882
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.500
I don't think there's anybody as prolific as him every year,

883
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.110
a whole new hour and a half or whatever the hell it is.

884
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.250
It was whole new show.

885
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.140
I did a show with him in,

886
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.003
uh,

887
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.500
Boston like two weeks ago and he,

888
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.334
uh,

889
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.660
this is going to freak you out.

890
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:37.780
I'm,

891
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.070
I'm not sure about this,

892
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:39.441
but I,

893
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:40.570
I'm pretty positive.

894
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:40.871
He goes,

895
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:41.111
yeah,

896
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:46.111
I was writing material and I need 45 minutes for my show for those,

897
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.340
the comedy section of his show.

898
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.173
And I'm sitting there going,

899
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.370
wait a minute.

900
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:52.204
So he,

901
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.710
that 45 minutes that he's written for his show for is eight or 10 episodes or

902
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:57.850
whatever of that show,

903
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.290
that 45 minutes isn't even going to be part of his next hour,

904
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.630
which he'll do probably in two months.

905
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.020
Really?

906
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.650
How,

907
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.131
you know what I mean?

908
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:06.820
God,

909
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.380
I mean I'm not in two months,

910
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:10.300
but I think he does an hour a year.

911
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:12.790
So that's,

912
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.890
I heard that and I was like wow.

913
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.120
Yeah.

914
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.690
He must just put himself in weird situations to make things happen that are

915
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.730
funny to talk about a certain point in time.

916
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:23.380
We just start driving a bad neighborhoods,

917
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.000
going to massage powers.

918
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:28.030
You don't even want to be at every book on premises,

919
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:29.470
anything.

920
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.330
Cause I talk a lot about food and I feel as though I,

921
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.320
there's no more food I I've talked about.

922
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.610
It's like yeah,

923
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.190
I have a theme of animals that can kill you.

924
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.240
I'm always fascinated,

925
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.010
terrified by animals that can kill you.

926
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.990
How many tiger drugs could I do so

927
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.920
<v 0>I can listen to you talk about lean pockets all day though.</v>

928
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.150
Cause I am a huge,

929
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:50.451
I like,

930
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:51.750
I eat more lean pockets.

931
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.090
Well I do lean because I was dying.

932
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.570
I seriously eat it.

933
00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.900
I eat like four weeks.

934
00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.190
Like I,

935
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.950
it's way,

936
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:01.640
it's simple.

937
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.600
It's so easy.

938
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.040
You know it's not good for you.

939
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:06.560
That's the blessing and the curse of hot pockets.

940
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.980
Right.

941
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.200
Is it changed my life that,

942
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:10.640
that joke hopefully,

943
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:15.641
you know it was a whole beyond the pale was good but it's like that hot pockets.

944
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:16.520
It's a blessing.

945
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:16.860
Right?

946
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.171
It's,

947
00:24:17.171 --> 00:24:20.240
it's opened up so many opportunities yet,

948
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.170
you know,

949
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.400
me walking through the airport,

950
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:25.010
people yelling hot pocket is not my favorite thing.

951
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.610
Right.

952
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.110
I mean I don't even know how to respond to it.

953
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.450
Do you get discounts for the coupons and they send you a note but when I,

954
00:24:30.451 --> 00:24:34.340
I used to have theater shows and they used to have a guy dressed as a hot pocket

955
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.610
standing outside passing out coupons or coupons and the hot pockets for hot

956
00:24:40.741 --> 00:24:41.180
pockets.

957
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.760
That's awesome.

958
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.310
Wow.

959
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.910
Pete you like make a deal with,

960
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.020
you know,

961
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.290
people thought that I was in cahoots with them and I was like,

962
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:49.700
I had to like send a letter.

963
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:51.410
Like you guys can't do that.

964
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:52.610
You gotta pay me.

965
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.270
Yeah.

966
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.600
Right.

967
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.433
Well,

968
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.240
you don't want to be associated.

969
00:24:56.241 --> 00:25:00.170
We don't want to food product feed the hot pocket thing,

970
00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:00.860
you know?

971
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.131
Yeah.

972
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:03.950
You don't want people actually buying hot pockets and having fucking heart

973
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:05.900
attacks on your behalf right now.

974
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:07.570
One thing to crack jokes about it,

975
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.060
you're doing the special when you get done with it or they released it on the

976
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:11.400
Internet.

977
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:11.960
Same Way.

978
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.200
And Are you going to start from all,

979
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.063
all new?

980
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.700
Yeah.

981
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.080
You can start scaling stage.

982
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.800
They're just going to get,

983
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.250
well,

984
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.740
the Ice House here in Pasadena has an annex room.

985
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:22.910
It's like an 85 seat room.

986
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.270
Yep.

987
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.840
And uh,

988
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.111
we,

989
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.920
we've been doing a lot of shows there and it's like the best place ever for

990
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:29.930
fucking around and coming up with new shit.

991
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.141
Oh,

992
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:30.440
real.

993
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.550
It's really small.

994
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:32.570
It's super intimate,

995
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.580
feel relaxed and you know,

996
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:36.320
and they kind of know that that's what we're doing.

997
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.240
So we have these podcast shows where we do all the comics will come and sit

998
00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:44.540
around and do a podcast and each one will go on stage and then come back and

999
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:45.374
that could be greener cat.

1000
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.310
Wow.

1001
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.431
Yeah.

1002
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:47.660
But it's a real green room.

1003
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.600
I mean it really is us right before we go on stage and there's like,

1004
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.841
you know,

1005
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:52.220
you see like how much time I have left.

1006
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.700
He's a,

1007
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.530
he's on now.

1008
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:53.690
He,

1009
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.170
Oh shit,

1010
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:54.831
I got to go ladies.

1011
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:55.161
Gentlemen.

1012
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:55.701
Thank you very much.

1013
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:56.180
Boom.

1014
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.730
And guys will leave and they'll come back in and you know,

1015
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.170
Hey Joey Diaz just returned.

1016
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:01.760
How other other fucking fantastic.

1017
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:04.340
And then he'll start talking about the show and you've got to do it.

1018
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.551
Oh,

1019
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:05.390
that's fun.

1020
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.620
It's really fun.

1021
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.370
You can have a different interp you might have different interpretation of the

1022
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:10.730
audio.

1023
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:11.330
Yeah,

1024
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.811
well yeah,

1025
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:12.920
there's definitely that.

1026
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:13.850
And there's also,

1027
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:14.780
when you come back here,

1028
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.010
just like this party going on,

1029
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.521
you know,

1030
00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:19.910
there's all these people and like Russell Peters came by with like fucking 10

1031
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:20.481
people with them.

1032
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:20.680
It's like,

1033
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.160
it's always something crazy like that.

1034
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.971
So it's like,

1035
00:26:22.971 --> 00:26:23.870
it's like a fun,

1036
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.540
it's a fun environment and the shows are amazing.

1037
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.840
And to me it's like I'm just going to concentrate and doing a lot of those

1038
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:30.081
shows,

1039
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:34.400
like really small shows and I have a bunch of ideas that I have in like fleshed

1040
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:34.930
out yet.

1041
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.500
I'm just going to ask.

1042
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.230
Nice.

1043
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.700
Chuck them in there and see what's up.

1044
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:38.511
Little kernels.

1045
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:41.240
Do you feel like the podcast is influencing your act?

1046
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.961
Oh yeah,

1047
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:42.630
for sure.

1048
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.140
Yeah.

1049
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.351
Well,

1050
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:45.510
it also changed my audience entirely.

1051
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.860
My audience at one point was like a combination of fear factor people,

1052
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:52.710
which were fading away and it was mostly like UFC fans.

1053
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:55.000
It was like kind of curious and then,

1054
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.410
you know,

1055
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.741
it was still,

1056
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:57.210
half of them knew what I was doing,

1057
00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.650
but now it's 100% and now it's like literally 90 to a hundred percent of the

1058
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:03.060
audience is all podcast fans.

1059
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.800
So they know you 100% they know you like as as as much as anyone could.

1060
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.320
No,

1061
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.000
that's fine.

1062
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.450
Yeah.

1063
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.500
Huge savings.

1064
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:11.563
Huge.

1065
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.810
Especially women.

1066
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.183
Tall ones.

1067
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.240
Lumberjack women.

1068
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.900
Yeah.

1069
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.261
You're not,

1070
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:18.060
you're not describing the Tizen bothering me.

1071
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.073
You're like,

1072
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.070
hey man,

1073
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.940
I'm open to anything.

1074
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.300
It's all depending on what kind of situation I'm in at the time.

1075
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.370
Do you think there's a guy out there that just goes after like the [inaudible]

1076
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.860
of course course.

1077
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:29.550
There's,

1078
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.080
there's people that like everything man.

1079
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.150
You know,

1080
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.270
there's a broad spectrum.

1081
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:33.411
You,

1082
00:27:33.411 --> 00:27:34.380
you've met people that,

1083
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:34.651
you know,

1084
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:35.730
you look at what their view men,

1085
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.360
people,

1086
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:36.601
I've,

1087
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:36.791
I've,

1088
00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:37.770
I've met a few people,

1089
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:38.821
kind of seven,

1090
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:40.050
11 west Hollywood.

1091
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.080
The shouldn't have went there.

1092
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:43.914
That was too easy.

1093
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.630
You ruined the vibe of the room.

1094
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.513
I'm sorry,

1095
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.790
I didn't mean to bring up the campuses.

1096
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.320
He's talking about gay neighborhoods and Hollywood is at West Hollywood.

1097
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.920
The guests want to gay as part of the world.

1098
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.911
Pretty much.

1099
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:58.700
We were in Compton today and that,

1100
00:27:58.770 --> 00:27:59.011
like,

1101
00:27:59.011 --> 00:27:59.940
I was thinking Compton like,

1102
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.500
oh my God,

1103
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.350
we have to get a competent.

1104
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:02.184
It's just scary.

1105
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.420
And it was like nice there.

1106
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:03.721
Yeah.

1107
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:06.090
Well the part where we were at was not the,

1108
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.260
where people live over in there in an industrial chief.

1109
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.800
He's singing about going total street just for the crud.

1110
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.550
I'm actually from Compton,

1111
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.763
Su,

1112
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.520
uh,

1113
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.353
main street,

1114
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.760
main street company street,

1115
00:28:20.761 --> 00:28:21.710
right next to the reservoir.

1116
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.860
Rosa Parks Avenue,

1117
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.810
right in Corner Compton.

1118
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.910
We were in a honey honey music video.

1119
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.380
Honey honey is this band that,

1120
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:29.040
uh,

1121
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.550
uh,

1122
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.550
we just found out about like a couple of weeks ago and they were like one of my

1123
00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:35.240
new favorite bands and I went to see them performing their lag,

1124
00:28:35.241 --> 00:28:35.881
got to meet them,

1125
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:39.600
and then they came into the podcast and they were fucking amazing and just

1126
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:40.950
really cool people and really,

1127
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:41.784
really talented.

1128
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.220
And so Brian and I were in a music video,

1129
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:47.680
just super awesome to meet Jason Ritter was there.

1130
00:28:47.681 --> 00:28:50.820
And so the whole afternoon I just got to sit down and hang out with Jason writer

1131
00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:52.500
and I'm a huge John Ritter Fan,

1132
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.510
so it's just so fucking weird.

1133
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:55.550
And I'm sitting there,

1134
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.030
that's the guy that was on a,

1135
00:28:57.031 --> 00:29:01.320
that one she's talking event three event or what's like,

1136
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.880
he was like one of the nicest guys.

1137
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:03.630
You ever work with them?

1138
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.811
Yeah,

1139
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:04.890
I did news radio with him.

1140
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:06.330
He did a couple episodes and his radio.

1141
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:07.164
He was great.

1142
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.930
It was nice.

1143
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:08.763
Yeah.

1144
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.331
Super,

1145
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:10.200
Super Nice Guy.

1146
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.041
Yeah,

1147
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:11.231
that,

1148
00:29:11.231 --> 00:29:13.560
that one was like that when a guy like that dies,

1149
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:13.801
you're like,

1150
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:14.011
wow,

1151
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:14.820
really?

1152
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.540
Really?

1153
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.250
Yeah.

1154
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.710
Yeah.

1155
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.970
It's like 50 or something like that.

1156
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.130
That affected me more than any celebrity death.

1157
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.371
Like,

1158
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:21.370
like all the other celebrity.

1159
00:29:21.371 --> 00:29:21.691
It's like,

1160
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:22.530
I don't know that person that,

1161
00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:22.701
yeah,

1162
00:29:22.701 --> 00:29:23.550
it sucks that they're gone,

1163
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:25.350
but for some reason I still think about that.

1164
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:26.430
John Ritter all the time.

1165
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.960
I would say that was up there,

1166
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:29.880
but Phil Hartman doused it for me.

1167
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.850
That was the craziest one and that's crazy.

1168
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.943
Well,

1169
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:34.560
yeah,

1170
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.760
John Ritter was hilarious.

1171
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.770
It was a really funny guy offstage too.

1172
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.910
Like in between takes,

1173
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:39.930
did you ever do anything with them?

1174
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.410
Yeah,

1175
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.090
I did a,

1176
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.280
an episode of

1177
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.950
<v 3>Ellen Second Sitcom with him.</v>

1178
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.823
Uh,

1179
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.370
and he was like a really nice guy.

1180
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.360
It's so interesting,

1181
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:49.601
you know,

1182
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:50.430
like the,

1183
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.560
that the actors that when we were kids,

1184
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.600
you know what John Ritter was like,

1185
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:56.681
uh,

1186
00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:57.760
I don't know who to compare him.

1187
00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.920

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.090

Died of AIDS.

1203
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.360
Really?

1204
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.193
Yeah.

1205
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.070
Yeah.

1206
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.460
God,

1207
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.900
I can't remember his name.

1208
00:30:24.901 --> 00:30:25.890
Can you find that Brian?

1209
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.030
Just Starsky and Hutch,

1210
00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:27.740
the,

1211
00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.740
the movie or the TV show brother.

1212
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.140
Just a TV show.

1213
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.950
The TV show.

1214
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.660
Not the movie with Ben Stiller.

1215
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:34.380
Not The new one.

1216
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.213
The old one.

1217
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.511
When I was a kid,

1218
00:30:36.511 --> 00:30:38.220
I fucking love this show.

1219
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.360
Started saying hot.

1220
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:39.721
Yeah.

1221
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:41.550
And then one day Christy and Hachi,

1222
00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:43.680
you seem like you could be a character on stairs.

1223
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.070
Started skiing so much.

1224
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.321
Really?

1225
00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:45.490
No.

1226
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:46.110
You know what I mean?

1227
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.291
No,

1228
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:47.124
cause it's,

1229
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.890
that was back in that seventies era,

1230
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:50.191
you know,

1231
00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:50.730
like,

1232
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:51.420
um,

1233
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:51.901
who was,

1234
00:30:51.901 --> 00:30:52.200
uh,

1235
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.831
Peter Falk?

1236
00:30:52.831 --> 00:30:53.400
He was one.

1237
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:53.580
Yeah,

1238
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.413
Colombo.

1239
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:55.081
Colombo.

1240
00:30:55.081 --> 00:30:56.670
And then there was an Beretta.

1241
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.181
I mean,

1242
00:30:57.181 --> 00:30:57.911
there was like the,

1243
00:30:57.911 --> 00:30:59.310
the fat guy called Jack.

1244
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.210
What was the fat guy?

1245
00:31:00.211 --> 00:31:01.620
That was the detective.

1246
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.490
It was a little later,

1247
00:31:02.491 --> 00:31:03.060
fat guy,

1248
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.900
Jake and the fat man.

1249
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.100
[inaudible] the fact that guy,

1250
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:06.750
you know,

1251
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.530
like that's the,

1252
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.870
that was the last TV show for like fat people for fat people,

1253
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.541
you know,

1254
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.171
that was it.

1255
00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:13.471
They're like,

1256
00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:13.921
sorry,

1257
00:31:13.921 --> 00:31:14.431
you know what,

1258
00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:15.151
Dennis France,

1259
00:31:15.151 --> 00:31:16.830
come on and you can get an Emmy.

1260
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.740
But like the guy was a lead and he,

1261
00:31:19.741 --> 00:31:19.981
you know,

1262
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:22.140
Dennis France was just like a regular looking guy.

1263
00:31:22.141 --> 00:31:23.730
But that Guy Jake and the fat man,

1264
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.330
the lead character was a big fat guy.

1265
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.860
Remember Samo Hung?

1266
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.010
He had a sick,

1267
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.570
he had a show on CBS with Arsenio Hall,

1268
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.550
I think it was a fat Kung Fu guy.

1269
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.170
Beat everybody up.

1270
00:31:37.171 --> 00:31:38.070
Do you remember that brand?

1271
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:38.870
No.

1272
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:39.570
God dammit.

1273
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.710
I can't remember the name of the show,

1274
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:41.071
but yeah,

1275
00:31:41.071 --> 00:31:41.590
he was a,

1276
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.000
uh,

1277
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.980
it was like a legit Kung Fu movie star,

1278
00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:45.580
but he was fat and uh,

1279
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.320
he could like throw kicks and head kicks in.

1280
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:47.971
Did you do everything?

1281
00:31:47.971 --> 00:31:50.220
But he was a fat guy and he would fuck guys up.

1282
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:51.863
<v 4>Right.</v>

1283
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.520
<v 3>I wonder what he's doing.</v>

1284
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.100
But he was a fat guy.

1285
00:31:56.101 --> 00:31:57.390
That also is the fact Gig.

1286
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.850
He had a good solid TV.

1287
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:59.400
You know,

1288
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.040
it's,

1289
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.830
there's like,

1290
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.190
you know,

1291
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.910
I would be considered like a severely obese person on TV,

1292
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.360
right?

1293
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:06.511
Well,

1294
00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:07.560
I guess the biggest loser,

1295
00:32:07.561 --> 00:32:08.640
there's big people on that,

1296
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.350
right?

1297
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.310
There's a very big people on the biggest loser,

1298
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.941
but there's a,

1299
00:32:11.941 --> 00:32:13.200
there's like the,

1300
00:32:13.201 --> 00:32:18.201
the emphasis on attractive people in movies and television is,

1301
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.310
it's like,

1302
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.960
it's not like disproportionate,

1303
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.140
it's like ridiculously disproportionate.

1304
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.800
Right.

1305
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.300
But when you need a,

1306
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.070
a character guy,

1307
00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:30.360
we need the Wacky,

1308
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:31.141
you know,

1309
00:32:31.141 --> 00:32:31.650
uh,

1310
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:31.870
what,

1311
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.060
what does the dude's name like Steve Buscemi character or something?

1312
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.610
So,

1313
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:35.851
you know,

1314
00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:36.301
movies,

1315
00:32:36.301 --> 00:32:36.710
he'll do that.

1316
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.460
[inaudible] I saw I was at the gym once and uh,

1317
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:41.720
and I saw,

1318
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.920
uh,

1319
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.080
I think it was an episode of bones was on,

1320
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:45.651
and again,

1321
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:45.871
I don't,

1322
00:32:45.871 --> 00:32:46.790
I don't know the show.

1323
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.870
I'm sure it's a good show,

1324
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.060
but literally the,

1325
00:32:49.061 --> 00:32:49.850
the show was,

1326
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.061
you know,

1327
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:52.890
like when you're on the plane and there's a TV show playing and you just got to

1328
00:32:52.891 --> 00:32:54.580
watch it and you don't have your phone,

1329
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.000
you don't have your headphones on.

1330
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.920
And from what I could tell,

1331
00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.240
it's they went,

1332
00:32:59.270 --> 00:32:59.760
you know,

1333
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.750
the attractive couple and then they,

1334
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.613
uh,

1335
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.690
someone dies who happens to be an attractive woman and then they go to a

1336
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:13.280
restaurant that I think I put my headphones in and it was,

1337
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.150
it was it,

1338
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.500
it was in the by you.

1339
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.250
Okay.

1340
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.250
I don't know if the show is set in Louisiana or not,

1341
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:23.990
but it was in the [inaudible] and the guy who was the owner of this authentic

1342
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:29.000
alligator by u bar had my accent and he was,

1343
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.920
he looked like he should be hosting,

1344
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.940
uh,

1345
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.320
the local news.

1346
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:33.621
Right.

1347
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:34.454
He did not.

1348
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.460
He did not look like if you've been to Louisiana,

1349
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.990
the people in Louisiana,

1350
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:39.261
I mean,

1351
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:40.280
I'm a white trash guy.

1352
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.970
It's like,

1353
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.481
you know,

1354
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:42.950
that's funky genetics,

1355
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:43.250
you know,

1356
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.911
it's just like,

1357
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:45.890
people don't like where I'm from.

1358
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.753
People don't wear,

1359
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.770
they wear sweatpants on Saturday night,

1360
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.400
you know what I mean?

1361
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:49.790
Right.

1362
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.350
When they go up because they're not working.

1363
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:51.800
Right.

1364
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.590
Harry Connick is this,

1365
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.490
Harry Connick is not the norm.

1366
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.641
And so anyway,

1367
00:33:56.641 --> 00:33:57.920
so like I watched the show,

1368
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:00.530
I kind of give up and hopefully this is worth it.

1369
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.170
So then I uh,

1370
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.200
I watch it and it's just like everyone is,

1371
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.940
I think there are FBI agents,

1372
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.240
everyone is like 27 like the oldest person was like 28 and they're like,

1373
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:13.811
no,

1374
00:34:13.811 --> 00:34:16.040
you've been here a year longer than me.

1375
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.650
It just was very interesting that there was,

1376
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.680
there was no one like 60 there was no one like 12 it was just everyone was the

1377
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:24.891
same.

1378
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:26.320
2011 there was,

1379
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:27.710
there were the same age.

1380
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.160
They,

1381
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.360
there were the same size.

1382
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:31.760
Like all the women were thin and all the guys were kind of,

1383
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.060
you know,

1384
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.900
like workout too at times a day kind of worked out body end.

1385
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:41.270
<v 1>There was no one that 27 years of age is a really pivotal moment for a woman's</v>

1386
00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:42.624
sexuality.

1387
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.201
Very,

1388
00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:44.034
very important.

1389
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.060
You know why?

1390
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.460
Because at 20 she doesn't know what's going on.

1391
00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:50.790
You're taking advantage of a little child and you know,

1392
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.530
at 37 she's like probably Desperado for relationship,

1393
00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:56.970
wants to settle down immediately.

1394
00:34:56.971 --> 00:34:58.140
Only has a few eggs left.

1395
00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:02.520
27 is like just old enough so that you're,

1396
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.383
you're not,

1397
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.740
you're not innocent anymore.

1398
00:35:04.741 --> 00:35:05.970
You're a dirty bitch,

1399
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.010
dirty bench and you want science Dick,

1400
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.581
you know,

1401
00:35:08.581 --> 00:35:10.020
that's a 27 year old girl.

1402
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.460
That's like really the perfect time.

1403
00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.740
Perfect time to fuck you.

1404
00:35:13.741 --> 00:35:14.760
Just increased your

1405
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.550
<v 3>pod,</v>

1406
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.350
a podcast audience,

1407
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.740
female demographic saying that explaining.

1408
00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:21.521
Well,

1409
00:35:21.521 --> 00:35:22.270
I don't know.

1410
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.103
I think it's like

1411
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.630
<v 1>if you simplify and generalize women,</v>

1412
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.990
well is there a broad term like that?

1413
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.750
These were brought up time.

1414
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.160
Not Saying all women are bulls.

1415
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:35.981
Jim Gaffigan,

1416
00:35:35.981 --> 00:35:36.310
Telco,

1417
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.821
captain.

1418
00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:38.010
Save a hoe on me buddy.

1419
00:35:38.011 --> 00:35:40.710
I'm just trying to make a common example.

1420
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:45.770
The women's Alliance and is the founding member of nobody would like women to be

1421
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.580
nice more than me.

1422
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.860
Nobody would root for them to be awesome.

1423
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:50.520
More than me.

1424
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.010
Nobody's happier than when women are nice more than me,

1425
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:58.430
but nobody likes to be or hates to be told what to do by a woman more than me.

1426
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:59.783
I don't like that.

1427
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.580
Or like bossy women especially like aggressive,

1428
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:03.391
aggressive,

1429
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:04.224
bossy women.

1430
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.350
Is there anything more uncomfortable when a woman gets aggressive and bossy with

1431
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:07.471
you,

1432
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:07.830
it's like,

1433
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.191
oh,

1434
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:09.450
this is so dangerous.

1435
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.960
Like is going to hit you with something so you don't like strong women.

1436
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.270
Not that I don't like bossy aggressive women.

1437
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:15.991
I like strong men,

1438
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:17.640
but I don't like bossy aggressive men either.

1439
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.190
There's something almost seems like,

1440
00:36:20.191 --> 00:36:21.120
Oh this stupid fuck,

1441
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:21.751
you can't even help it.

1442
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:22.584
It's in his nature.

1443
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.870
But aggressive woman to me is always like,

1444
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.381
oh my God,

1445
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:25.980
what are you doing?

1446
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.161
You're,

1447
00:36:26.161 --> 00:36:26.770
you're like,

1448
00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:26.941
you're,

1449
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:27.780
you have no brakes.

1450
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.270
You're just driving crazy and you have no brakes.

1451
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:30.870
Yeah.

1452
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.990
It's interesting because there's a difference between like being a nudge and

1453
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:34.890
being confident.

1454
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.320
Yeah.

1455
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.820
Yeah.

1456
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.170
Well there's a difference between,

1457
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.740
um,

1458
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.370
you know,

1459
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:38.820
uh,

1460
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.820
being assertive and being aggressive and confrontational in an unrealistic way.

1461
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.690
And whenever anybody does side,

1462
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:46.950
it's always uncomfortable.

1463
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:47.240
But it's,

1464
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:47.581
for me,

1465
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:49.050
it always freaks me out when,

1466
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:50.880
when women get like aggressive and crazy.

1467
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.520
Like when a woman starts screaming at the guy and putting her hands in his face,

1468
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:53.761
I'm like,

1469
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:54.481
Whoa,

1470
00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:56.010
what are you doing?

1471
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.270
Like this is new.

1472
00:36:57.271 --> 00:36:59.040
This is almost physical violence here.

1473
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:00.790
You are instigating this right,

1474
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:01.980
but this ain't gonna end well.

1475
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:02.880
This is crazy.

1476
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.810
Like I bet if we had a fight like all the men versus all the women,

1477
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.420
we would kick the shit out of them.

1478
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.750
Most likely we would do.

1479
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.910
We would totally,

1480
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.350
you know like,

1481
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.060
I mean I might get beat up,

1482
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:16.080
but you wouldn't.

1483
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.150
I think I would get beat up eventually.

1484
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.410
Is this enough of them?

1485
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:22.950
I think there's 51% of the population and that 1% means a lot.

1486
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:25.950
If it was like a lot of chicks around you and when you're talking about millions

1487
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:26.640
of people,

1488
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.380
that 1% can be pretty substantial.

1489
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.060
There's some guys that were just like,

1490
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:31.320
that's their fantasy.

1491
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:31.831
Yes.

1492
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:36.620
To get beat up by everybody knows the one guy that has every relationship he's

1493
00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:36.961
ever in.

1494
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:39.420
The woman's in control and she yells at him and tells him what to do and he's

1495
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:40.260
always miserable.

1496
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.970
It's a terrible situation.

1497
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.170
Everybody knows that guy though,

1498
00:37:43.171 --> 00:37:43.560
right?

1499
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.393
Everybody?

1500
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.433
Yeah,

1501
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.431
it's country.

1502
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.950
But I wouldn't want to be a woman and to have a country man either.

1503
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:50.350
You know,

1504
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.250
just the only reason why I feel this way is because I'm a man and I've seen so

1505
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:55.740
many guys get their lives ruined by women who probably don't even,

1506
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.420
they probably can't even help what they're doing.

1507
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.570
And the reason why I say this is because I had an ex girlfriend and she always,

1508
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.590
she was a very nice person.

1509
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.180
She liked to fight and she just loved it.

1510
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:04.740
She would just start a fight for no reason.

1511
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:05.131
And I'd be like,

1512
00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:05.611
what are we doing?

1513
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:05.851
Come on,

1514
00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:06.684
this is crazy.

1515
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.940
And after awhile we became friends,

1516
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:09.600
but we,

1517
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.650
we stopped dating.

1518
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.570
And so she started dating another guy and was going through the same thing with

1519
00:38:13.571 --> 00:38:15.360
screaming them and yell at him and,

1520
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.010
but this guy would just take it,

1521
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:17.844
he would just eat it.

1522
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.910
And so we had a conversation one day and she's smoking a cigarette and shaking.

1523
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.381
She's like,

1524
00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:23.610
I can't help it.

1525
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:24.540
She goes,

1526
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.800
I have to test him.

1527
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.320
She goes and when he lets me walk all over him,

1528
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:29.310
I just want to fucking,

1529
00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:33.450
I want to scream loud enough so that he turns me around and tells me to stop so

1530
00:38:33.451 --> 00:38:35.440
that he brings me back to normal and tells me to stop.

1531
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:35.920
I'm like,

1532
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.880
you might be the craziest fucking person on the face of the earth.

1533
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.710
Like imagine living your life like that.

1534
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.790
What a bitch.

1535
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.623
She's not a bitch.

1536
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:47.710
She's just compelled by her own genetics to not have a bitch for a man.

1537
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.720
You know,

1538
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.000
she,

1539
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.421
she was like,

1540
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:50.650
oh well wild horse.

1541
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:51.610
He needed to be broken.

1542
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:52.390
Jim Gavin

1543
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.330
<v 3>talking about she did.</v>

1544
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:54.993
Yep.

1545
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.620
Are you still doing Pale force?

1546
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.753
Nope.

1547
00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.121
No,

1548
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:00.130
I haven't done that for God.

1549
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:00.701
In a sense.

1550
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:05.701
Conan had a Fallon's was pale force pill force was where it was an animated

1551
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:07.930
thing that actually my brother in law,

1552
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:08.783
um,

1553
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.930
Paul knows who's a cartoonist for the New Yorker.

1554
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:15.170
He came up with this idea of an animated series where Conan,

1555
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:15.670
I would,

1556
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.980
we're superheroes that would fight crime with our paleness and sweet.

1557
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.800
We would shoot lasers from our nipples is awesome.

1558
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:24.940
And it's the art style.

1559
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:25.960
Did he do that then?

1560
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.040
They did all that.

1561
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.290
Did he do the Saturday night live?

1562
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.330
A Fun House?

1563
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.343
The videos.

1564
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:32.770
That's my goal.

1565
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.550
That's right.

1566
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.300
Yeah.

1567
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.871
But yeah,

1568
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:35.400
I loved it.

1569
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:35.890
I think,

1570
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.150
I thought it was a lot of funny.

1571
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:38.080
She could do that more.

1572
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:38.530
Yeah.

1573
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.530
I think while NBC owns it and me,

1574
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.980
NBC and Conan,

1575
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:43.290
I don't know if they're a net good of,

1576
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:43.740
oh,

1577
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.573
that's right.

1578
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.161
Oh yeah,

1579
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:45.994
that's right.

1580
00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:47.450
Yeah.

1581
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.760
Dating Barrett and they can't even do that.

1582
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.660
What a mess.

1583
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.291
What a mess.

1584
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:50.801
That whole thing.

1585
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:51.670
One of the masses.

1586
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:52.270
Right.

1587
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.350
So crazy.

1588
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.940
Just the whole idea was crazy.

1589
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.480
Putting the Jay Leno show on at 10 like what you're going to have the tonight

1590
00:39:58.481 --> 00:39:58.791
show on.

1591
00:39:58.791 --> 00:39:59.410
I mean,

1592
00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:01.540
earlier when they did that,

1593
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:03.370
didn't you think that that was,

1594
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.800
I thought that was their way of like,

1595
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:06.320
well,

1596
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.153
if Joe,

1597
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.680
if Jay fails,

1598
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:10.390
then we say we give them a try.

1599
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.580
But I think I like that.

1600
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:13.391
That's what I thought.

1601
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:15.520
They thought it was going to happen.

1602
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:17.080
But what happened was,

1603
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.550
because Jay was on earlier,

1604
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:21.460
I killed Conan's chance to even get an audience.

1605
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.810
So people would watch the tonight show at 10 and then they wouldn't watch it

1606
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:26.703
later.

1607
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.550
Does that make sense?

1608
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.911
Yeah,

1609
00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:28.744
it does.

1610
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.170
Yeah.

1611
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:30.190
It was ridiculous.

1612
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:30.790
It was silly.

1613
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:31.720
It was a silly idea.

1614
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.770
It's where,

1615
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.480
you know you're the comedy policemen.

1616
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:35.040
No,

1617
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.410
no,

1618
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:35.870
you aren't.

1619
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.020
She called me that before the Improv and I told you that would be very

1620
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:38.530
uncomfortable.

1621
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.520
That makes you uncomfortable.

1622
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.030
Not really,

1623
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.870
but I only,

1624
00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:41.704
I looked,

1625
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:42.770
I haven't,

1626
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:45.580
I'm not enjoying step in for one piece of civil unrest.

1627
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.230
That's something I've never done anything since.

1628
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:47.711
Well,

1629
00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:52.711
there's something about that whole situation with a Lenovo and I don't know

1630
00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:54.700
which eye at all and uh,

1631
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.990
but it's,

1632
00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:56.621
you know,

1633
00:40:56.621 --> 00:41:00.210
if there was a Joe Rogan of that generation maybe to go and,

1634
00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:01.044
uh,

1635
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:01.953
explain it,

1636
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:02.710
that's why you,

1637
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.730
that's our new show.

1638
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.790
You look for bigfoot

1639
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.500
comedy kind of a,

1640
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:12.840
<v 1>well,</v>

1641
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.060
I think for all of us there was a,

1642
00:41:15.061 --> 00:41:19.590
there's been a few instances in the past where there was a guy that was kind of

1643
00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:22.320
like clearly plagiarizing another guy and then you know,

1644
00:41:22.321 --> 00:41:24.270
one guy became famous with other people's Shit.

1645
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.890
I mean it's happened more than once and we've all felt the real pain and

1646
00:41:28.891 --> 00:41:32.280
frustration of watching someone do somebody else's material where you'd know

1647
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:32.990
that they're stealing,

1648
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.823
they know in the dark,

1649
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:34.720
not compensating them,

1650
00:41:34.721 --> 00:41:35.051
they're just,

1651
00:41:35.051 --> 00:41:37.640
they're just stealing and it was like a wild west thing.

1652
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:39.750
It was like no one was doing anything about it and it was a,

1653
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.750
and to treat it like it was no big deal.

1654
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:42.890
You're absolutely crazy.

1655
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:46.940
It's the core of someone's ability to perform on stage is having great material.

1656
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:47.930
It's their life,

1657
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.800
it's their life.

1658
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.970
You can be the best comic in the world.

1659
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.770
You have nothing to say on stage for that moment.

1660
00:41:51.771 --> 00:41:54.600
If you go on stage and you have nothing prepared and he had nothing to say,

1661
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.221
you're fucked.

1662
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:56.090
It's not going to be good.

1663
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.290
You need premises,

1664
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.041
you need material.

1665
00:41:58.041 --> 00:41:58.501
And so to,

1666
00:41:58.501 --> 00:42:00.380
to pretend that it wasn't a big deal,

1667
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.600
that the industry was treating it like it wasn't a big deal.

1668
00:42:02.601 --> 00:42:02.991
And we were like,

1669
00:42:02.991 --> 00:42:03.771
this is crazy.

1670
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:03.911
Like,

1671
00:42:03.911 --> 00:42:04.191
you know,

1672
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:05.330
I think you've got an insane,

1673
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.360
I told you that night what you did was very important.

1674
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.961
I mean,

1675
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:10.610
it was very important.

1676
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.941
Well,

1677
00:42:10.941 --> 00:42:12.770
for us it had to happen.

1678
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.960
It had gotten to a point where no one,

1679
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.140
everyone was just turning a blind eye to it because they are profiting off of

1680
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:18.830
it,

1681
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:19.101
you know?

1682
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:21.510
And that's what happens when a person becomes successful and,

1683
00:42:21.511 --> 00:42:21.790
and,

1684
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.440
and is a plagiarist if it was any other form of art,

1685
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:25.130
whether it was,

1686
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.640
you know,

1687
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.480
writing it would,

1688
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:26.650
right.

1689
00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:27.750
It would be super clear.

1690
00:42:27.751 --> 00:42:27.940
I mean,

1691
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.970
the guy was going to jail,

1692
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.680
you know,

1693
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.560
and he was music.

1694
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:33.830
They take all your money if they can prove the of the same beats and you're

1695
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:35.200
copying it like you're taking,

1696
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.320
they take all your fucking money,

1697
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:36.640
man.

1698
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.250
Yeah.

1699
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.630
And we're not talking about,

1700
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.170
you know,

1701
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.300
similar premises which we all have,

1702
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:45.530
which is all going to happen where tiger woods who has a fucking tiger woods,

1703
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:46.011
Joe put your,

1704
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:46.580
raise your hand,

1705
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.120
everyone,

1706
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.800
anyone.

1707
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.700
Everyone sat down and said this fucking a gold mine.

1708
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.800
You can never claim a premise but you,

1709
00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:54.420
you absolutely know when,

1710
00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.880
when when the language is lifted.

1711
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.790
Well you also know where there's smoke,

1712
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:00.140
there's fire and they can't.

1713
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.680
I think I truly believe that people who steal can't,

1714
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:04.370
right.

1715
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:05.090
I really do.

1716
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:05.960
I think it's the,

1717
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.670
I don't think you can do both.

1718
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:12.110
I think something happens when you steal and that that this,

1719
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:14.930
this being disingenuous,

1720
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.790
this pretending,

1721
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:18.940
this bullshit knowing that you are,

1722
00:43:18.941 --> 00:43:21.890
you are not really doing what you're claiming to be doing,

1723
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:25.130
that you are pretending and that you're ripping people off and lying and

1724
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:27.770
projecting this false self image which is like all ego,

1725
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.160
which is exactly what shuts you off from the ability to come up with new shit.

1726
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.540
Like when you come up with new shit,

1727
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.240
it's not like you thinking about you.

1728
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.081
You see something,

1729
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:37.340
a hook of this side here.

1730
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:38.480
This is what,

1731
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:39.600
this is ridiculous and that,

1732
00:43:39.601 --> 00:43:40.011
you know what I mean?

1733
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:40.741
It's not you,

1734
00:43:40.741 --> 00:43:41.270
you,

1735
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.380
I mean it's you coming up,

1736
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:43.101
but then you think about,

1737
00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:44.630
but you're not involving yourself.

1738
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:47.180
You're not trying to project a certain image.

1739
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:47.511
You're not,

1740
00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:47.960
you know,

1741
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.000
making sure that people think of you a certain way.

1742
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:51.110
You're not even thinking like that.

1743
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.180
Because when you do think like that,

1744
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.110
that's,

1745
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:56.360
that's shuts off creativity.

1746
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.870
And when a guy steals what a guy's doing when he's stealing is he's trying to

1747
00:43:59.871 --> 00:44:01.010
make himself better than he is.

1748
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.990
He's trying to pretend that he's smarter than he is.

1749
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.880
He's trying to put out stuff,

1750
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.610
pretending that he figured this out when it real is really someone else.

1751
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:08.444
It's all ego.

1752
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.180
It's,

1753
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.550
it's really sad too.

1754
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.960
It's sad in a way because I think that it's almost as if,

1755
00:44:14.961 --> 00:44:15.171
you know,

1756
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:15.891
like policemen,

1757
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:17.450
they have like rabbis,

1758
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:17.840
you know,

1759
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.200
it's like,

1760
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.540
I feel like almost comedian should have rabbis,

1761
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.130
someone to sit there and go,

1762
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:22.730
all right,

1763
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.271
you know what?

1764
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:24.560
You might not want to do that.

1765
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.473
You know,

1766
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.750
it's such a strange business and we're all very individual and,

1767
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:30.480
but you know,

1768
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:30.670
the,

1769
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.000
the,

1770
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.350
the,

1771
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.100
the irony

1772
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.970
<v 0>also is,</v>

1773
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.850
is that any comedian would tell you that,

1774
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:36.870
uh,

1775
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.870
the respect of their peers is way more important than whether you're selling out

1776
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:44.070
Saturday night.

1777
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:44.581
Yeah.

1778
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:48.420
That hurts guys bad when their peers turn on it's protocols,

1779
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:49.050
guys back.

1780
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:49.561
It's like,

1781
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:49.981
you know,

1782
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:50.850
it's like you,

1783
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:53.280
you always heard about comedians that like,

1784
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:53.881
you know,

1785
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:57.720
like African American communities when they would comedians they would lose the

1786
00:44:57.721 --> 00:44:58.560
black audience.

1787
00:44:58.561 --> 00:44:59.910
I mean that's brought us,

1788
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.660
but like when,

1789
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.160
when Comedians,

1790
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.451
you know,

1791
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:06.540
don't respect her flaws as great for weight loss.

1792
00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:08.430
I heard you have no money for food.

1793
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.293
Yeah,

1794
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:09.730
yeah.

1795
00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:10.563
But

1796
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.200
yeah,

1797
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.750
um,

1798
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.071
that,

1799
00:45:13.071 --> 00:45:14.610
that can be really devastating to God.

1800
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:16.260
Let's talk about something that's more depressing.

1801
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:16.890
No,

1802
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:17.071
wait,

1803
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:17.640
you mean it's,

1804
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.080
I think what's important is like what we were talking about earlier,

1805
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.730
we were talking about Louis C k like w when you're doing it the right way,

1806
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:24.720
not just doing it the right way,

1807
00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.430
but like fucking trailblazing,

1808
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:28.530
like way faster than anybody else's being,

1809
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.790
putting out that kind of material.

1810
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.020
And putting out great stuff.

1811
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:32.430
It's not like the quality suffering.

1812
00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:33.480
It's still really fun.

1813
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.040
Great observations.

1814
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:36.670
And so there's a lot of thought behind.

1815
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.040
It's like really great stuff.

1816
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.020
So we sit here and we talk about that,

1817
00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:41.010
like how amazing that is.

1818
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:41.340
That's,

1819
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.270
that's the positive thing.

1820
00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:42.940
And I'm sure,

1821
00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.211
you know,

1822
00:45:43.211 --> 00:45:44.910
he gets that all the time cause that,

1823
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.300
you know,

1824
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.380
that's what the fuck he's doing.

1825
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:46.621
You know?

1826
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:46.870
And he's,

1827
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:47.090
yeah,

1828
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:47.670
he's,

1829
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.210
he's,

1830
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.920
he's got this whole momentum thing going.

1831
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:51.630
He keeps turning out the great new stuff.

1832
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.810
People keep enjoying it and it keeps moving and moving and moving.

1833
00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:58.550
And that's really an example for everyone to see every young comic to see that

1834
00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.580
it can be done.

1835
00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:00.660
It's just do it the right way.

1836
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:01.411
You do it the right way.

1837
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:02.850
It's incredibly satisfying.

1838
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.310
But if you hack and,

1839
00:46:04.311 --> 00:46:07.170
and chop your way and take other people's premises,

1840
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:07.740
man,

1841
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.071
boy,

1842
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:08.791
you're fucking,

1843
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:10.320
you're not just fucking yourself up.

1844
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.400
You're fucking him up.

1845
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:14.370
You're fucking the community up if it gets tolerated,

1846
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:19.430
but it becomes a real problem because I think some of the cliches you might

1847
00:46:19.741 --> 00:46:20.430
disagree with me,

1848
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.060
I think,

1849
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:25.590
I think like basic cliches about comedians are not true.

1850
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:26.850
Like there are a lot,

1851
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:27.280
you know,

1852
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.500
like all Comedians,

1853
00:46:28.501 --> 00:46:29.100
Haiti.

1854
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.040
I think actually that's actually the opposite.

1855
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:33.180
I think most Comedians,

1856
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.240
if you're getting on stage there,

1857
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.620
you're predisposed to like the guy yes.

1858
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:37.991
Or,

1859
00:46:37.991 --> 00:46:40.260
or a woman and Spicy Sinbad.

1860
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.280
I don't know Sinbad,

1861
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.450
but if I see Sim that,

1862
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:42.631
I mean,

1863
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:43.800
I'm not really into his stuff,

1864
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.401
but I'd be like,

1865
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:44.521
Hey,

1866
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:45.061
what's up man?

1867
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:45.570
How you doing?

1868
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.403
I'm like,

1869
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.120
hello.

1870
00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.400
It's like there's,

1871
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.730
there's so many different types of comedy.

1872
00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:51.061
You're,

1873
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:52.680
you're at least going to be respectful.

1874
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.700
Of course.

1875
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.810
You're not going to go out of your way.

1876
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.081
I mean,

1877
00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:56.160
there are exceptions.

1878
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:56.521
You know,

1879
00:46:56.521 --> 00:46:57.270
where like,

1880
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.841
I think Larry,

1881
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:00.350
the cable guy and David Cross had like a feud.

1882
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:01.950
I think that was silly.

1883
00:47:01.951 --> 00:47:03.780
I read David's arguments about that.

1884
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:04.860
I thought that was really silly.

1885
00:47:04.861 --> 00:47:05.071
I mean,

1886
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:05.431
I think,

1887
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:05.671
yeah,

1888
00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:07.230
Larry does have like a few,

1889
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:07.530
uh,

1890
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.041
sort of,

1891
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:08.820
uh,

1892
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.750
Islamophobic Sorta raghead jokes in his act and stuff.

1893
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:13.470
But I mean,

1894
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.990
wouldn't that,

1895
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.611
what I mean,

1896
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:15.900
he is playing a character.

1897
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:18.480
Are we supposed to pretend that the character wouldn't think like that?

1898
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:20.220
I get confused about that when,

1899
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:20.431
you know,

1900
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:23.460
the guy's name is Dan Whitney and he's doing a thing called Larry the cable guy

1901
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:25.710
and this guy is supposed to be stupid as fuck and live in the south.

1902
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.530
I see Dave's argument that it might be encouraging racism,

1903
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:30.040
but I

1904
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.740
<v 3>also like,</v>

1905
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.620
she really did.

1906
00:47:31.621 --> 00:47:32.710
She do you think Larry,

1907
00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:37.320
the cable guy is changing anybody's mind whether it's awesome was a bad ships a,

1908
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:42.340
it's a slippery slope is very slippery slope and the shit on anyone's choices

1909
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:42.941
when it comes to that.

1910
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:43.660
I mean,

1911
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.900
some of the funniest stuff I've always said is the most inappropriate,

1912
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:47.550
ridiculous.

1913
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.760
Like auto and George,

1914
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:49.430
you know,

1915
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.191
like you ever seen that?

1916
00:47:50.191 --> 00:47:51.020
You seen that one George?

1917
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.171
Me?

1918
00:47:51.171 --> 00:47:51.550
No,

1919
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:51.821
no.

1920
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:52.370
Are you kidding?

1921
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.203
One of my favorites.

1922
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.280
First got an opening spots in New York around,

1923
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:57.521
you know,

1924
00:47:57.521 --> 00:47:58.890
and I would tank and then they would,

1925
00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:00.790
there would be a middle that would do okay.

1926
00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:02.230
And then auto and George would go up.

1927
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:03.303
What year was this?

1928
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:04.900
Nah,

1929
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.320
1831 he's got something he's doing online.

1930
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:08.741
Check it out.

1931
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:09.820
It's called the pig roast.

1932
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.200
I don't know the exact address,

1933
00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:11.891
but if you Google it,

1934
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:13.510
just Google auto and George the pig roast.

1935
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.081
I don't want,

1936
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:15.190
George is a Hilarious,

1937
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:18.820
a puppet act in New York and he was always like that example of a guy who would

1938
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:20.000
just say to all the,

1939
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.150
the dummy was evil as fuck.

1940
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:27.151
His dummy would see the shit quotas is that people would leave and they would

1941
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:29.410
say that one guy was funny,

1942
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:31.810
but I thought the [inaudible] was really rude.

1943
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.011
Oh my God.

1944
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:33.670
It's like,

1945
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:34.220
I know.

1946
00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:34.840
Yeah.

1947
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.880
He would say some of the craziest,

1948
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:38.440
most ridiculous racist shit.

1949
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.690
And then tongue and he would still the dummy,

1950
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:41.141
hey man,

1951
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:42.760
you can't fucking say that and it's wrong.

1952
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.540
And then we're like,

1953
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.373
fuck you.

1954
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.120
What a great gimmick.

1955
00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:46.691
You know,

1956
00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:48.400
to have a really angry,

1957
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:50.680
psychotic fuck a dummy and the comedy is him.

1958
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.720
He says fucked up shit and you go man,

1959
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:53.770
I can't believe you're saying that.

1960
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.300
That'd be what I'm not even making brilliant idea.

1961
00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.710
I can't believe he did that.

1962
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.240
But that's,

1963
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:00.750
that's a,

1964
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.170
it's a style of comedy.

1965
00:49:02.171 --> 00:49:04.780
It's like death metal or they really killing people every day.

1966
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.053
That's really,

1967
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.491
you know,

1968
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:07.420
it's a style.

1969
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.070
It's,

1970
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.340
it's a type of comedy.

1971
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:09.641
There's,

1972
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:10.160
there's uh,

1973
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:10.810
you know,

1974
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.660
and people want to say like shock comedy that it's cheap.

1975
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.470
I so disagree cause it doesn't work unless it is funny.

1976
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.670
I mean shock comedy won't work on me unless it is funny and there's a certain

1977
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.530
art to writing ridiculous,

1978
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:26.880
shocking shit cause there's an art to it and it's a type,

1979
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.220
it's a genre to style shock comedy is,

1980
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:33.670
it's the SL align on in the northeast.

1981
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:34.780
That's where

1982
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.860
the a seller line,

1983
00:49:38.861 --> 00:49:39.110
you know,

1984
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:40.030
what does Amtrak,

1985
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.280
Amtrak from Boston to DC.

1986
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.260
There's the Slo line.

1987
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:44.750
Have you ever heard?

1988
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.921
No.

1989
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:45.041
No.

1990
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:45.874
I never heard of it.

1991
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.321
And,

1992
00:49:46.321 --> 00:49:46.870
um,

1993
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:48.100
but that's where like,

1994
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.790
that's where tough guy comedy comes from is like,

1995
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:53.320
is like Boston,

1996
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.310
you know,

1997
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.270
New Jersey,

1998
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:56.800
Philly,

1999
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.100
right?

2000
00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:57.851
It's like that.

2001
00:49:57.851 --> 00:49:58.470
And that,

2002
00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:01.600
that Amtrak train goes up and down that.

2003
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:02.320
And those are like,

2004
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.310
those are the,

2005
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:04.870
those are the tough guys.

2006
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.740
You're a tough guy.

2007
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.813
You know what I mean?

2008
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:08.410
How did we get to this?

2009
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.370
What were we talking about?

2010
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.121
Well,

2011
00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:10.954
we're just talking about,

2012
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.220
I dunno,

2013
00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.450
I completely lost my point.

2014
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:14.950
Just made me uncomfortable.

2015
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.251
It did.

2016
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:16.270
I make you uncomfortable,

2017
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.790
but you know what I'm talking about?

2018
00:50:18.791 --> 00:50:20.320
Like the,

2019
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.190
I don't know George.

2020
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.000
Oh,

2021
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.330
George.

2022
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.370
But I do enjoy angry mean comedy.

2023
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.550
Yeah.

2024
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:24.911
Not,

2025
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:26.080
not necessarily mean,

2026
00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:26.790
but shocking.

2027
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.110
Like,

2028
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.370
I think in New York it was,

2029
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:29.120
it was,

2030
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:29.953
uh,

2031
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:35.380
it was important to appear tough when I was starting out will not,

2032
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:38.390
not having emotion attached.

2033
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:39.111
You see that?

2034
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:42.320
And Louis Louie has it and a towel has it.

2035
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.760
And Kevin Brennan has it.

2036
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.280
And a Marin.

2037
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:46.581
I mean,

2038
00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:49.850
even though Marin is such an open book,

2039
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:53.810
he has a little bit like being unphased by at least on stage.

2040
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.710
Does that make sense?

2041
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:55.010
Oh yeah,

2042
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.171
yeah,

2043
00:50:55.171 --> 00:50:55.370
yeah.

2044
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.270
You have it too.

2045
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:56.451
Well,

2046
00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:57.141
you have to,

2047
00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:57.410
uh,

2048
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:58.221
well you have to,

2049
00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:58.581
you know,

2050
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:01.130
really be into what you're thinking about and if you're into what you're

2051
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:01.910
thinking about,

2052
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:02.181
you know,

2053
00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:05.060
you're not going to be really phased if people are into it or not.

2054
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.510
You gotta you know that there's a certain number of people that are your people.

2055
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.513
Yeah.

2056
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.150
Especially if you're doing weird shit,

2057
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.750
you know?

2058
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.931
I mean,

2059
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:13.460
you're really clean,

2060
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:14.510
but really funny.

2061
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.560
But do you ever find yourself in a situation where like everyone in front of you

2062
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:23.570
around you is just talking about anal fisting loads and rape and then you go up

2063
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:25.821
and you're like,

2064
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:26.511
okay,

2065
00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:26.991
if you're like,

2066
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:27.351
hey,

2067
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:28.610
who wants to talk about cake?

2068
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.473
What about,

2069
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.650
well,

2070
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.921
no,

2071
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:31.970
it's you appear,

2072
00:51:31.971 --> 00:51:32.241
you know,

2073
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:33.074
if someone's,

2074
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:34.040
you know,

2075
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.400
fucking a chair or simulated it,

2076
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:37.923
that's my shit.

2077
00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:38.450
No,

2078
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.070
but it's hard to go up there and go,

2079
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:40.420
you know,

2080
00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:40.700
you know,

2081
00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.550
it's interesting to this section of the USA Today.

2082
00:51:43.551 --> 00:51:44.271
It's hard,

2083
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:44.541
right?

2084
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:46.520
Because you just appear so boring.

2085
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:48.740
But if you follow,

2086
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.800
so if you don't follow someone really filthy or kind of like crushing,

2087
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.490
so it just crushes it,

2088
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:57.080
crushes or just kind of,

2089
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.280
uh,

2090
00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.020
just,

2091
00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.200
uh,

2092
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.033
reverend,

2093
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.351
you know,

2094
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:01.770
just thick irreverence,

2095
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.181
then,

2096
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:02.481
you know,

2097
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:02.901
it's not,

2098
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:03.141
I mean,

2099
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:04.040
you can do it.

2100
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.271
It's just like,

2101
00:52:05.271 --> 00:52:06.770
it's different styles of comedy.

2102
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.251
You know what I mean?

2103
00:52:07.251 --> 00:52:10.790
It's like if like a Metallica went on,

2104
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.650
I wouldn't want Jane.

2105
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:13.400
I sir,

2106
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.570
I wouldn't want to be James.

2107
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.201
Thanks.

2108
00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:16.430
So you're calling me James Taylor.

2109
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.860
James Taylor is awesome by the way.

2110
00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:19.790
I'm a James Taylor Fan.

2111
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.790
My mind,

2112
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:21.820
he's,

2113
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.130
yeah,

2114
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.970
he's a bad ass.

2115
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.571
I like James.

2116
00:52:23.571 --> 00:52:23.870
Yeah.

2117
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:24.470
For Real.

2118
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.303
Yeah.

2119
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:25.821
No.

2120
00:52:25.821 --> 00:52:26.654
So

2121
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:28.900
they let me know.

2122
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.330
See,

2123
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.041
I was growing up,

2124
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:33.320
I remember a bad mother fucker when I was 16.

2125
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.030
I got my driver's license.

2126
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:36.680
Here's another boring story by Jim gas.

2127
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.980
And I got my driver's license and uh,

2128
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.030
went to a concert with,

2129
00:52:43.031 --> 00:52:44.360
I am the youngest of six kids,

2130
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:47.060
so my brothers and sisters went to a concert,

2131
00:52:47.061 --> 00:52:48.650
which was the James Taylor concert.

2132
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.740
I know that this sounds edgy already.

2133
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.970
So I was 16.

2134
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:56.571
And I,

2135
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:57.404
uh,

2136
00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.311
I thought,

2137
00:52:58.311 --> 00:52:58.551
you know,

2138
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:02.630
all you gotta do is show an ID and they'll let you have a beer.

2139
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.160
And so I showed my idea,

2140
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:07.400
I got my driver license driver's license that day.

2141
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.520
So I showed him the ID and the guide took my idea because you're,

2142
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.500
you're not 21.

2143
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:14.900
He took the ID so I didn't have an ID.

2144
00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:17.300
So I got my driver's license that day.

2145
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.090
So then the next day my dad in the morning was like,

2146
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.361
Hey,

2147
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:21.560
let me see your driver's license.

2148
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:22.394
Do you know you guys?

2149
00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:29.310
And so then a week later my driver's license shows up male and uh,

2150
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.360
with a letter from the guy who ran,

2151
00:53:32.361 --> 00:53:32.631
you know,

2152
00:53:32.631 --> 00:53:33.630
I know what it was,

2153
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.700
somewhere in Chicago,

2154
00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:36.050
Alpine valley or whatever.

2155
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.420
And the guy's name was James Taylor.

2156
00:53:38.421 --> 00:53:39.410
So like James Taylor,

2157
00:53:39.411 --> 00:53:43.340
I'm like James Tattooed of connected.

2158
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.233
Yup.

2159
00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:46.590
It's coke.

2160
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.640
Zeros go into my head.

2161
00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:49.050
You getting crazy.

2162
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:49.950
I'm getting crazy.

2163
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:51.060
James Taylor will do that.

2164
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:51.811
It does it to women.

2165
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:54.990
And occasionally the hit the estrogen genes that you have dark,

2166
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:57.360
dark in the closet tucked away.

2167
00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:00.340
See I sang the beginning of that song and you just,

2168
00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.060
I saw you swap a little easy chair email to a little,

2169
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.260
I have melted a little bit.

2170
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.580
James Taylor songs are like a little back rubs like,

2171
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.621
but that's also,

2172
00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:07.981
you know,

2173
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:08.814
that's,

2174
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.580
that's kind of now some of those songs.

2175
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.310
It's like I know those songs because of it.

2176
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:14.691
My,

2177
00:54:14.691 --> 00:54:15.140
uh,

2178
00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.340
brothers and sisters,

2179
00:54:16.341 --> 00:54:16.850
right.

2180
00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.190
I mean it's not like I was sitting there like I got to,

2181
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:20.250
you know,

2182
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:20.700
well somebody,

2183
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.391
I was listening to you,

2184
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.020
but did you,

2185
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.030
did you ever by a James Taylor CD on your own?

2186
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:24.900
I Dunno.

2187
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.560
I know.

2188
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.041
Maybe.

2189
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:26.700
I don't know.

2190
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:26.881
No,

2191
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:28.020
I didn't buy a CD.

2192
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.520
I have proudly,

2193
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.690
I think I even bought up the second tier,

2194
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.700
like a martial arts expert.

2195
00:54:33.701 --> 00:54:37.350
So you're allowed to say shit and people would be like,

2196
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:38.520
he's still a tough guy.

2197
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:39.780
I'm not going to call him a buzzy.

2198
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.471
But you know,

2199
00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:41.760
like I sit there and I,

2200
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:42.330
uh,

2201
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.010
I read the New York Times and people are like,

2202
00:54:44.011 --> 00:54:44.121
well,

2203
00:54:44.121 --> 00:54:45.480
I have to beat up the librarian.

2204
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:46.483
You know what I mean?

2205
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:51.180
Even though I played you being self deprecating while you're reading the New

2206
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.040
York Times that that's happened many times.

2207
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.260
I actually played,

2208
00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:55.710
I was,

2209
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.330
I played football in college.

2210
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.440
People think I'm a pussy.

2211
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:59.130
That's scary.

2212
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:00.320
Football is fucking terrorists,

2213
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.193
division three,

2214
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.161
whatever it is,

2215
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:03.750
they're big people running into your man.

2216
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:04.710
That shit's dangerous.

2217
00:55:04.711 --> 00:55:05.610
Did you ever do any of that?

2218
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.210
Ooh,

2219
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:08.190
I wrestled in high school and my coach was always like,

2220
00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:09.420
we're all getting used to playing football.

2221
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:09.640
Yeah.

2222
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.051
Crazy.

2223
00:55:10.051 --> 00:55:10.531
You'll be great.

2224
00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:11.700
I wrestled in high school.

2225
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.490
I wrestled the hundred and 34 pounds and 34 pounds.

2226
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.540
That was the ladies division.

2227
00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.230
Yeah,

2228
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.491
no,

2229
00:55:16.491 --> 00:55:16.860
that was,

2230
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.910
I was under the ladies.

2231
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:20.240
I would help them be ready.

2232
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:20.701
No,

2233
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:23.880
I was one 67 I remember I was undefeated my senior year.

2234
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:24.421
What are you really,

2235
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:27.060
you were killing wrestler one 77 again,

2236
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:29.550
this is a spy school and uh,

2237
00:55:29.551 --> 00:55:34.170
so you know how like we didn't have tons of guys on the team.

2238
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.710
So like I lost like 10 pounds in a week that I remember.

2239
00:55:37.711 --> 00:55:39.160
Like people used to do that and right.

2240
00:55:39.161 --> 00:55:39.390
So yeah,

2241
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:40.070
I did that.

2242
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.980
You'd lose 10 pounds to go to a different division and you would wrestle that

2243
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:47.730
because there was like some big fat guy who could do mine because they didn't

2244
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:49.140
have someone for that slot.

2245
00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:49.890
Right.

2246
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:51.600
So I lost 10 pounds.

2247
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.830
I was undefeated and then um,

2248
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:54.610
you know,

2249
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:56.770
I went out there and I like blacked out,

2250
00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.493
pinned,

2251
00:55:59.650 --> 00:55:59.990
you know,

2252
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.620
and it was,

2253
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.060
it was brutal because I was,

2254
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.010
it was close to an undefeated season.

2255
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.600
That's pretty bad ass though.

2256
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:07.640
I beat the guy that was third in state.

2257
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.720
Wow.

2258
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:10.370
How come you never did anything with it afterwards?

2259
00:56:10.371 --> 00:56:11.320
You ever tried Jujitsu?

2260
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:12.350
I,

2261
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:12.650
you know,

2262
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:14.000
I don't like standing up

2263
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.210
exercise at all.

2264
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.291
I mean,

2265
00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:18.531
yeah,

2266
00:56:18.531 --> 00:56:18.741
no,

2267
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:19.640
I used to be thin,

2268
00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:20.271
but you know,

2269
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:20.451
I'm,

2270
00:56:20.451 --> 00:56:22.130
I'm not talking about like back in the day,

2271
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.060
I'm talking about like do,

2272
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.040
do anything right now.

2273
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:24.890
<v 0>Do I do that?</v>

2274
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.700
And he won 97 or [inaudible] 96.

2275
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.633
That's really good.

2276
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:31.563
I heard it.

2277
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.010
I've heard it works that if you just follow what this guy's doing,

2278
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.280
it really will transform your,

2279
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.830
it's all scientific principles still work out.

2280
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:39.350
I used to,

2281
00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:39.701
I,

2282
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:39.941
you know,

2283
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:40.900
I was pretty buff.

2284
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.370
I've watched a video of it.

2285
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.900
It's fucking pretty intense stuff.

2286
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.650
I try new wines.

2287
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:44.861
It's,

2288
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:45.490
I couldn't do it.

2289
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.260
It's been tough.

2290
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.010
And do you work out five days a week?

2291
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:49.030
At least five days a week.

2292
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:50.860
Do you have like a gym in your house?

2293
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:51.970
I have two gyms in my house.

2294
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.833
Well that's normal.

2295
00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:53.733
Everyone.

2296
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:59.780
I have a weightlifting gym in my house and I also have a kickboxing set up all

2297
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.590
caged in,

2298
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:01.423
in my garage.

2299
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:02.830
That's amazing.

2300
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.101
Yeah,

2301
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:04.030
it's a company.

2302
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:06.960
Did it for rather a television show due to call garage Mahal.

2303
00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:08.730
It's pretty bad ass ever released that shot.

2304
00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.181
Yeah.

2305
00:57:09.181 --> 00:57:09.490
Yeah.

2306
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:11.050
It's a Bill Goldberg,

2307
00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:12.660
that big wrestler Guy and he's the,

2308
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:12.730
uh,

2309
00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:16.810
the host of it and they take over your garage and in three days they transformed

2310
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:17.070
it.

2311
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:19.860
My garage is just like an episode of drastic,

2312
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:20.763
then you're kind of like,

2313
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.330
where am I going to park my car?

2314
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.691
No,

2315
00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:22.781
no,

2316
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:22.930
no.

2317
00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:23.800
It's a four car garage.

2318
00:57:23.801 --> 00:57:24.634
So I have two cars,

2319
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.850
two s club to NBC for years.

2320
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.310
Um,

2321
00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:31.840
so to two cars is just pat it up.

2322
00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.110
Yeah.

2323
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:35.943
Let cars,

2324
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:36.740
well,

2325
00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:37.340
how many,

2326
00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.173
you got two cars.

2327
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:39.063
I've got a few cars.

2328
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:39.941
How many cars do you have,

2329
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:40.630
Jay?

2330
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:41.470
I have four cars.

2331
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:42.281
Four cars.

2332
00:57:42.281 --> 00:57:42.740
Really?

2333
00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.330
And what's,

2334
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:44.050
what's the,

2335
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:44.801
what's your,

2336
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:45.970
the love of your life car?

2337
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:48.040
I have a Porsche gt three,

2338
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:49.480
like the,

2339
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:49.680
it's,

2340
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.690
it's basically like a regular Porsche.

2341
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.680
They take all the,

2342
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.750
they like unnecessary shit out of it.

2343
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:56.650
Like the back seat.

2344
00:57:56.651 --> 00:57:57.880
They strip all the sound deadening.

2345
00:57:57.881 --> 00:57:58.601
They make it lighter.

2346
00:57:58.601 --> 00:57:58.991
They pick up,

2347
00:57:58.991 --> 00:57:59.561
put a bigger,

2348
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:02.020
stronger high revving racing engine in it,

2349
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.430
tighten up to suspension,

2350
00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:04.211
carbon fiber,

2351
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:05.044
brakes,

2352
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:05.681
the whole thing.

2353
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:07.060
It just becomes this most,

2354
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:10.090
the most ridiculous responsive car you could ever drive.

2355
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:14.020
It's like you're glued to the road like you feel like every day.

2356
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.770
It's incredible.

2357
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:15.161
Not even,

2358
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:16.330
not even for driving fast,

2359
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:17.620
driving illegally.

2360
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.191
This is,

2361
00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:18.950
this is kind of a,

2362
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:20.920
it makes me think of this point.

2363
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:22.600
It's like when you started stand up,

2364
00:58:22.601 --> 00:58:23.950
did you think that you were,

2365
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.750
I mean maybe I don't know you that well.

2366
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:28.030
It's like I went in to stand up because I want it to,

2367
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:28.560
I,

2368
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.620
I never had an expectation that I would be able to afford to have a family from

2369
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:33.440
standup.

2370
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:37.270
You probably didn't expect that you'd be able to own four cars.

2371
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:37.571
No,

2372
00:58:37.571 --> 00:58:38.110
never.

2373
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:38.441
Of course,

2374
00:58:38.441 --> 00:58:38.930
man.

2375
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:41.920
I never would have believed that I could make a living off of it.

2376
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:42.371
In the beginning.

2377
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:43.350
That was a dream,

2378
00:58:43.351 --> 00:58:44.530
a distant dream.

2379
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:48.250
The great dream was to be a local Boston standup comic,

2380
00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:49.480
to be like a local guy.

2381
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.960
You know,

2382
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.780
there was a bunch of local guys that made a living.

2383
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.181
They drove,

2384
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:52.381
look at,

2385
00:58:52.381 --> 00:58:54.320
he's got a nice Honda Lucas.

2386
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.570
We've got a great fucking apartment.

2387
00:58:55.571 --> 00:58:57.490
It's a loft as offices on the top.

2388
00:58:57.491 --> 00:58:57.670
Boy,

2389
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:58.503
that's where he writes.

2390
00:58:58.570 --> 00:58:59.620
He's a pro.

2391
00:58:59.621 --> 00:58:59.831
I'm like,

2392
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:01.870
this is a pro that gets paid to be a comic.

2393
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.530
Sans [inaudible] likes unfathomable.

2394
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.870
I had just had a series of shitty jobs,

2395
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:08.150
you know,

2396
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:09.190
and all of it.

2397
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:10.030
Drove a limo.

2398
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:15.031
Did construction every po delivered newspapers every possible ridiculous job.

2399
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:15.781
So no,

2400
00:59:15.781 --> 00:59:17.320
and would have never thought I'd have four cars.

2401
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:17.410
Oh,

2402
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:18.700
I never thought I'd have money at all.

2403
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:19.953
It's amazing.

2404
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:20.590
Yeah,

2405
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.230
it's amazing.

2406
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.651
It's weird.

2407
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:21.871
It's,

2408
00:59:21.871 --> 00:59:22.100
it's,

2409
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.371
<v 1>well,</v>

2410
00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:22.731
you know,

2411
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:27.731
and I think the lesson that other people can learn always from anyone success

2412
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.551
is,

2413
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:29.840
it might not be the same path,

2414
00:59:29.841 --> 00:59:31.490
but if anybody can do it,

2415
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:32.390
you can do it.

2416
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:34.040
It really is that fucking simple.

2417
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:35.750
And it might not be everything.

2418
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.261
You know,

2419
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:36.771
it might not be,

2420
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:37.820
I can't play basketball.

2421
00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:38.331
I can't run.

2422
00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:39.111
I'm not a jumper.

2423
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:39.351
I'm not,

2424
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:40.190
I'm not fast.

2425
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:40.640
You know,

2426
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.750
it's like I'm too short.

2427
00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:42.643
I can't do that.

2428
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:43.490
Maybe I could,

2429
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:45.540
maybe if I dedicated myself 100% of that,

2430
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:45.681
I mean,

2431
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:47.810
it wasn't there a guy like Muggsy Bogues he was like five,

2432
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:48.111
six,

2433
00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:48.944
he played in the NBA.

2434
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:49.791
But the point is,

2435
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:51.410
whatever the fuck it is,

2436
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.693
just,

2437
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:53.930
just do it.

2438
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.800
Just go do it.

2439
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.730
Find a way to do it.

2440
00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:57.501
If anybody can do it,

2441
00:59:57.501 --> 00:59:58.060
you can do it.

2442
00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.630
<v 3>I think there's also a justing cause you know,</v>

2443
01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.620
when you have these,

2444
01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.300
when you do like interviews,

2445
01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:04.950
like when you're,

2446
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:05.530
you know,

2447
01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:07.630
touring during standup headlining and clubs,

2448
01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.000
you'll get interviewed by the local paper.

2449
01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:10.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.290
And they'll want to create some story,

2451
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:13.801
you know,

2452
01:00:13.801 --> 01:00:14.101
it's like,

2453
01:00:14.101 --> 01:00:14.291
oh,

2454
01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:15.000
for a headline,

2455
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.140
he's from Indiana.

2456
01:00:16.141 --> 01:00:17.190
He had no shoes.

2457
01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.750
Talk to him about cake.

2458
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:19.830
You know,

2459
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:20.550
it's like they,

2460
01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.280
these elaborate stories so it ends up,

2461
01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:23.700
you know,

2462
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.360
it's like,

2463
01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.193
I don't even,

2464
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:27.840
our stories are real stories.

2465
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:29.503
<v 3>Uh,</v>

2466
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.030
they kind of adjust.

2467
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.070
I think when I started stand up,

2468
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.330
I love to stand up,

2469
01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.730
but I wanted to be a writer for Letterman.

2470
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.400
I thought that would be an unbelievable job.

2471
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:40.660
And you know,

2472
01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:41.171
it's just,

2473
01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:42.400
it's an amazing,

2474
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.811
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2475
01:00:42.811 --> 01:00:43.351
the journey.

2476
01:00:43.351 --> 01:00:44.070
Believable job.

2477
01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:44.221
I mean,

2478
01:00:44.221 --> 01:00:46.770
that's like the elite of the elite as far as comedy writers.

2479
01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:48.480
Like this is Bobby writes for Letterman.

2480
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.343
Whoa,

2481
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.680
right?

2482
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.281
For Letterman,

2483
01:00:50.281 --> 01:00:50.981
Holy Shit.

2484
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:51.990
And when we started,

2485
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.300
Letterman was always the top of the,

2486
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620
I think right now,

2487
01:00:55.621 --> 01:00:55.831
I mean,

2488
01:00:55.831 --> 01:00:56.910
I love Letterman,

2489
01:00:56.911 --> 01:00:59.100
but I think Jimmy Kimmel is at least as equal.

2490
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.750
I think Jimmy Jimmy was fucking brilliant.

2491
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:01.993
I really think he's,

2492
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.301
yeah,

2493
01:01:03.301 --> 01:01:03.721
I think,

2494
01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:03.961
well,

2495
01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:04.171
yeah,

2496
01:01:04.171 --> 01:01:05.160
Conan is always equal.

2497
01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:05.401
I mean,

2498
01:01:05.401 --> 01:01:06.720
he's always funny in his own way.

2499
01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:06.931
You know,

2500
01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:07.200
he's,

2501
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.000
I think he's very different than those other,

2502
01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.020
those other guys.

2503
01:01:10.021 --> 01:01:13.590
And I think one of the beautiful things about his show was all the things that

2504
01:01:13.591 --> 01:01:14.011
people would go,

2505
01:01:14.011 --> 01:01:17.070
I'm accustomed to that they pulled from him that he can't even use now.

2506
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.110
And I think that's really fucked up.

2507
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:19.840
You know the whole,

2508
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.790
it's so silly.

2509
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:22.550
The whole thing to me it says so stupid.

2510
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:22.740
What?

2511
01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:24.450
You can't do the talking dog anymore.

2512
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.231
You can't do it.

2513
01:01:25.231 --> 01:01:26.130
You know what?

2514
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:27.960
There's like a million things that he can't do anymore.

2515
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.630
Like that's just petty horse shit.

2516
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.350
I think that's completely patty.

2517
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:31.651
Yeah,

2518
01:01:31.651 --> 01:01:32.484
it's ridiculous.

2519
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:33.820
It's a strain.

2520
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:34.590
You let the show,

2521
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.131
that's the show.

2522
01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:36.150
The show's over there now.

2523
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:36.870
It's with colon.

2524
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:37.703
Come on man.

2525
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.420
It's is so silly.

2526
01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:40.683
It's very strange.

2527
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.360
They should be able to buy it back.

2528
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.990
If they should sell it back to them

2529
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.930
<v 3>valley and someone goes and they,</v>

2530
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.880
you know there are the head coach here and then,

2531
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:51.830
then you go there,

2532
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.820
he goes to another team.

2533
01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:52.941
You,

2534
01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:53.301
you,

2535
01:01:53.301 --> 01:01:54.510
you get something for it.

2536
01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:54.720
Yeah.

2537
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.110
It's not like you're sitting there cause I think there's no,

2538
01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.310
like these coaches,

2539
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.350
they're not supposed to be able to coach.

2540
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.580
You know,

2541
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:05.210
like if they leave they have to finish their contract of seven years or

2542
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:06.044
whatever.

2543
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:09.680
They're not supposed to be able to coach for the rest of the seven years.

2544
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:10.640
But they do anyway.

2545
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:11.490
<v 1>Well that's a,</v>

2546
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:12.680
didn't that happen with radio?

2547
01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:13.630
With Tom Likes us.

2548
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:19.200
I'll really like his had a deal with the 97 one FM talk in La and they

2549
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:20.010
syndicated is

2550
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.340
<v 0>show all throughout the country and those talk radio shows,</v>

2551
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.930
I don't know what killed the man.

2552
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:25.880
What would kill talk

2553
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:28.440
because look man,

2554
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:30.210
when you think about what that was,

2555
01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:31.380
that net network,

2556
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:32.790
I believe they had Howard on in the morning,

2557
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:33.001
right?

2558
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:35.480
It was Howard and then it was a,

2559
01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.680
it was frosty Heidi and frank and it was like,

2560
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:39.570
there was a bunch of good fucking shows.

2561
01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:40.150
It's like,

2562
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:41.070
well how did that get,

2563
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.300
how did that go away?

2564
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:42.611
Like what?

2565
01:02:42.611 --> 01:02:43.231
What happened?

2566
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:44.460
What killed talk radio.

2567
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.740
Radio is just hurting in general.

2568
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:49.950
These podcasts.

2569
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:50.490
Nothing.

2570
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:50.780
Not,

2571
01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.120
no.

2572
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.520
I don't know.

2573
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.440
Was cause that was before podcasts before we had ever done it.

2574
01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:54.600
No,

2575
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.160
it is like this was off the air.

2576
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:56.761
Yeah.

2577
01:02:56.761 --> 01:02:58.950
But sounded like was puck was podcasts,

2578
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:00.430
but podcasts really popular when,

2579
01:03:00.431 --> 01:03:03.120
when like us was off the air podcast we obviously weren't doing,

2580
01:03:03.121 --> 01:03:04.200
but where was anybody.

2581
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.411
Yeah,

2582
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:06.570
podcasts are really popular and then it went away.

2583
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:08.550
Then the iPhones Kinda came out in a,

2584
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:09.630
they start,

2585
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.910
that was pre Carolla podcast.

2586
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.820
It was Corose still have the radio was satellite radio.

2587
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.500
[inaudible] was the morning show.

2588
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.070
After awhile.

2589
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.050
Remember Howard went to Saddleback.

2590
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:19.801
That's what it was.

2591
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:22.320
Do people listen to in the morning in la?

2592
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.460
Like living in New York?

2593
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.740
He used to be awesome.

2594
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:28.620
That's one of the things that I used to love the most about driving to work and

2595
01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:31.800
being stuck in traffic was that I was listening to Howard stern and they would

2596
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:32.634
report it.

2597
01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:33.900
No,

2598
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.210
he is.

2599
01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.300
He's still on regular radio.

2600
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:36.901
Regular radio.

2601
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:37.920
That doesn't exist anymore.

2602
01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:38.930
There's nobody like that anymore.

2603
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.250
I mean there are,

2604
01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.400
there are some morning shows like Kevin and being in La,

2605
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.421
there's still gray.

2606
01:03:42.421 --> 01:03:42.970
They're huge.

2607
01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:43.230
Right?

2608
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.770
They're there.

2609
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:45.330
The last of the Mohicans,

2610
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.080
Carson Daly and see Chris,

2611
01:03:47.081 --> 01:03:48.480
don't they have shows in Hartsdale?

2612
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.021
He has a radio show.

2613
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:49.680
I thought so.

2614
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.760
That was nice to let her know.

2615
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:53.820
I know Seacrest Seacrest has like 100,000 fucking jobs.

2616
01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:54.654
He must be insane.

2617
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:59.030
Nobody works harder than that guy who has what puts in more hours a day.

2618
01:03:59.031 --> 01:03:59.401
And that guy,

2619
01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:00.450
he's on that he show,

2620
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.400
he's got a radio show he's on,

2621
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:04.110
he's on the star search.

2622
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:05.010
Whatever the fuck it is.

2623
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.993
But it just,

2624
01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:08.490
let's see what the stars,

2625
01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:09.330
what the fuck is he on?

2626
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.130
The big white American idol,

2627
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:12.990
the big one that she was still on.

2628
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.050
I think amazing.

2629
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:18.600
There is some ideas sometimes what you're saying there is something about

2630
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.540
people want to,

2631
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.190
it's not greed.

2632
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:23.760
It's like,

2633
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.421
I think that,

2634
01:04:24.421 --> 01:04:25.290
and I don't know Ryan,

2635
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.124
sea crest,

2636
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.320
big surprise and uh,

2637
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:29.071
but I think he,

2638
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:29.401
you know,

2639
01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:30.570
he wants his empire.

2640
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.290
Yeah.

2641
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:35.530
I think some people want their empire and I think you recognize opportunities.

2642
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.740
A smart gun that,

2643
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.051
you know,

2644
01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:38.100
and it is very smart,

2645
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:40.020
but it's maybe it's crazy.

2646
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.760
I think it did at least a little crazy.

2647
01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.200
They didn't want to have a little fun.

2648
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:44.340
Well,

2649
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.220
and also he might just super that the only thing he's into is like

2650
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:48.054
entertainment.

2651
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:48.953
And might be true too.

2652
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:49.381
Brian,

2653
01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:50.130
what are you doing with the,

2654
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:50.851
the fucking thing?

2655
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:51.750
You crazy asshole.

2656
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.140
What are you doing with that effect on getting ready to go to the bathroom?

2657
01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:55.850
Oh,

2658
01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.520
oh,

2659
01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:56.671
oh,

2660
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:58.290
so you're going to leave the screen like this.

2661
01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:58.920
Oh,

2662
01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.753
I like that.

2663
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.133
That's very clever.

2664
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:01.891
Do you feel weird?

2665
01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:02.051
We're,

2666
01:05:02.051 --> 01:05:03.870
we're right next to each other on this video screen.

2667
01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:04.704
Can we just talk,

2668
01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.131
look,

2669
01:05:05.131 --> 01:05:05.431
just,

2670
01:05:05.431 --> 01:05:07.320
let's look at the screen and,

2671
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:07.830
uh,

2672
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.420
let's see if we can have a conversation this way.

2673
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.393
I bet we can.

2674
01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.220
I bet we can know how to even Janet over there.

2675
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:15.060
It's too weird.

2676
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.710
It's like I'm not the brightest guy.

2677
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.850
It's a thing to watch yourself talk.

2678
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:19.690
I don't think that's healthy.

2679
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:19.901
Yeah,

2680
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:20.291
I'm not,

2681
01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:20.651
I,

2682
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:23.470
I was editing my special and you know,

2683
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:24.400
my wife and I were,

2684
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:25.420
and it was,

2685
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:25.770
uh,

2686
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:26.480
it's,

2687
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:26.920
I mean,

2688
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.820
the thing is like,

2689
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:28.480
it's one thing,

2690
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.250
it's like I'm out of shape.

2691
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:31.001
It's like,

2692
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:32.980
that's the beauty of like,

2693
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.920
I'm not looking at yourself,

2694
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:39.330
is not realizing how out of shape you've gotten.

2695
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:43.210
Not that I was easy to look at before I was out of shape.

2696
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.430
You're half your act as about like a little bit about self indulgence and

2697
01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.160
delicious things and gluttony.

2698
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.590
Do you think that if you,

2699
01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:53.850
uh,

2700
01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:57.280
if you got yourself in like spiffy condition that my fuck up your material?

2701
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.070
I've heard people say shit like that before.

2702
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:00.791
That's interesting.

2703
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:01.031
You know,

2704
01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:01.930
there was a point,

2705
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.620
you know,

2706
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.100
when,

2707
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:03.933
uh,

2708
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.690
about a year ago while I was doing something else,

2709
01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:08.800
but I thought,

2710
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:09.011
you know,

2711
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:09.400
I was,

2712
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.410
I was working out because I had more time,

2713
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:15.850
so I was working out more consistently and not eating horribly at three in the

2714
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:16.684
morning.

2715
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:17.620
Um,

2716
01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.161
and I was like,

2717
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:18.994
you know,

2718
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.050
it entered my mind.

2719
01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:20.560
It's like,

2720
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.500
am I going to be too in shape for some of these jokes?

2721
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:24.940
Um,

2722
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.380
but I don't know.

2723
01:06:26.381 --> 01:06:26.940
That's kind of,

2724
01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.600
that's just me being neurotic crime.

2725
01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:29.220
Like,

2726
01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.790
can we do it shape for these children?

2727
01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:31.751
That's hilarious.

2728
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:33.070
What a great escape clause.

2729
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:33.933
I can't,

2730
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.830
my act is so important.

2731
01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:36.910
I can't do sit ups.

2732
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.661
I can't,

2733
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.021
you know,

2734
01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:38.980
I work out,

2735
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:42.520
but it might mess up like that third chunk is in the hour.

2736
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:44.170
So stupid.

2737
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:45.400
But I really believe this,

2738
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:45.851
that,

2739
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:45.971
uh,

2740
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:46.391
I was,

2741
01:06:46.391 --> 01:06:46.720
uh,

2742
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.590
getting into a meditation and I was getting into yoga and a bunch of things when

2743
01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:51.424
I was young.

2744
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.761
And,

2745
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:52.180
uh,

2746
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.140
when I had first started getting,

2747
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:54.910
getting into comedy and then I thought about it,

2748
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:55.211
I said,

2749
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:55.930
you know what,

2750
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:59.560
maybe I shouldn't do this because maybe becoming more enlightened is probably

2751
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.400
bad for my ad.

2752
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.490
It's interesting because then I wouldn't be making fun of as many things are

2753
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:08.020
picking as many victims that especially that's a comedian there.

2754
01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:08.530
Right.

2755
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.330
Cause especially Boston style comedy,

2756
01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.170
so mean.

2757
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:12.003
So you know,

2758
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:14.350
attack it's attack style.

2759
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:14.801
You know.

2760
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:15.251
And I was thinking,

2761
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:15.461
man,

2762
01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:17.830
if I became enlightened and I was all like peace and love,

2763
01:07:17.831 --> 01:07:21.460
like this would be terrible for my art and I'm not going to stop being a

2764
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:21.821
comedian.

2765
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:22.091
You know,

2766
01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:22.924
it might not,

2767
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.000
I wouldn't want to eat healthy.

2768
01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:25.834
You know,

2769
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.930
I think I got another hour,

2770
01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:30.590
I may be a healthy,

2771
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:31.930
I owe my fans.

2772
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:32.411
Yeah.

2773
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:34.840
And then you run out of shit and then you'd go healthy and then nobody wants to

2774
01:07:34.841 --> 01:07:35.674
come see anymore.

2775
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.930
Well I used to be really thin.

2776
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.010
I mean,

2777
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:39.700
I did.

2778
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.690
I know you're looking at me like no,

2779
01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:40.780
you,

2780
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.310
I believe you.

2781
01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:41.540
No,

2782
01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:41.891
no,

2783
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:42.070
no.

2784
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:42.670
I actually,

2785
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:43.840
I remember you being thin.

2786
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:44.660
Just A,

2787
01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.070
I mean,

2788
01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:46.090
not even a decade ago,

2789
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:47.223
right?

2790
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.550
How many,

2791
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:48.383
how long ago was it?

2792
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.650
Um,

2793
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:50.320
I dunno,

2794
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.190
eight years ago.

2795
01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:51.761
Who was the guy?

2796
01:07:51.761 --> 01:07:54.730
There was a guy who was like a really funny fat guy and then he lost a lot of

2797
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:57.340
weight and then he kinda like stopped being around.

2798
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.713
I want to say Vic,

2799
01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:01.990
Vic something in Vic Dunlap.

2800
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.220
Was it very funny,

2801
01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:03.461
funny.

2802
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:05.010
I was thinking fic Vic Dunlop,

2803
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:05.950
very funny.

2804
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.090
Really,

2805
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:07.923
really heavy.

2806
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.650
And then he lost a lot of weight or he had the surgery and the surgery.

2807
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.910
I don't know if he did or he didn't,

2808
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:13.451
but whatever,

2809
01:08:13.451 --> 01:08:15.530
whatever method he choose chose,

2810
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:15.711
I mean,

2811
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:16.070
maybe I'm

2812
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.320
<v 1>just not up on what he's doing these days,</v>

2813
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:21.200
but I remember seeing that guy everywhere when he was big.

2814
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:21.591
And then,

2815
01:08:21.591 --> 01:08:22.030
you know,

2816
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:23.540
he got skinny and you know,

2817
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.180
don't hear about it too much now.

2818
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:26.331
Well,

2819
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:26.570
you know,

2820
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.841
it's,

2821
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:28.880
it's weird because we also,

2822
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.700
if people will disappear and you don't even realize they're gone.

2823
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.121
Yeah.

2824
01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:32.870
That was weird.

2825
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:33.490
Right.

2826
01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:36.140
And it's guys that you were like that I thought that guy was going to be around

2827
01:08:36.141 --> 01:08:36.974
forever.

2828
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:37.853
Like that.

2829
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.690
Really funny.

2830
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:41.240
It's interesting he said women,

2831
01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:42.170
is that getting married,

2832
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:42.741
having kids,

2833
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:43.521
you thought it'd be that.

2834
01:08:43.521 --> 01:08:43.821
It could be,

2835
01:08:43.821 --> 01:08:45.380
some people get tired of the stress.

2836
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.771
You know,

2837
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:47.880
Jim and I were talking about how much we love standing up.

2838
01:08:47.881 --> 01:08:48.890
We would never quit doing it,

2839
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.380
but everybody's got a different psychological makeup.

2840
01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:53.200
And for some people the,

2841
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:53.540
uh,

2842
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.210
anxiety and performance is like really intense.

2843
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:56.960
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2844
01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.411
Especially,

2845
01:08:57.411 --> 01:08:57.951
it's also,

2846
01:08:57.951 --> 01:08:58.251
it's,

2847
01:08:58.251 --> 01:08:59.084
I think that,

2848
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.923
uh,

2849
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.550
some of it's luck.

2850
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:01.791
I mean,

2851
01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:03.290
it's a real cruel business.

2852
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.010
Yes.

2853
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.611
So,

2854
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:04.941
I mean,

2855
01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:06.950
I was definitely an angry guy,

2856
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:07.161
you know,

2857
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:10.610
like for a lot of people were successful before me and I was,

2858
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.860
I was angry or bitter couple of years,

2859
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.220
really get yourself out of that therapy.

2860
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.150
Really.

2861
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.983
Yeah.

2862
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.411
Wow.

2863
01:09:18.411 --> 01:09:18.711
You know?

2864
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:19.281
And that's,

2865
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:19.521
you know,

2866
01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:24.521
just also I came to the conclusion that I was not doing stand up.

2867
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:26.510
Uh,

2868
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.781
you know,

2869
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:27.520
I wanted,

2870
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:27.791
you know,

2871
01:09:27.791 --> 01:09:29.180
I wanted to be,

2872
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.280
I was happy for my friends success,

2873
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:32.600
but I felt like I was a failure,

2874
01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:37.601
but like I had to come to the conclusion what is success and what success is,

2875
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:41.180
is like doing what you love and actually getting paid for it.

2876
01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:46.040
And so then I adopted that attitude and then things started going my way and

2877
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:48.860
that's why I'm releasing a 12 books series.

2878
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.950
<v 5>That's interesting,</v>

2879
01:09:52.951 --> 01:09:53.330
man.

2880
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:54.111
<v 1>That's really cool.</v>

2881
01:09:54.111 --> 01:09:55.670
I love hearing stuff like that.

2882
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:59.030
I love hearing somebody figuring things out and just turning it all around.

2883
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.710
A lot of wasted energy on it.

2884
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.830
That was really a lot of wasted on haters.

2885
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:05.570
I always say no haters are winners.

2886
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:05.991
There's no,

2887
01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:06.171
no,

2888
01:10:06.171 --> 01:10:06.440
no,

2889
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:06.621
no.

2890
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:10.430
People out there writing scathing youtube comments where they just break down

2891
01:10:10.431 --> 01:10:12.270
your fucking soul winners through.

2892
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:13.100
You're not happy.

2893
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.933
There's no way you are,

2894
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.070
you wasting your energy and what are you wasting it.

2895
01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:16.610
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2896
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:17.151
It's also,

2897
01:10:17.151 --> 01:10:18.740
it's like you put out,

2898
01:10:18.741 --> 01:10:19.910
you get what you put out.

2899
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.750
Yes you do.

2900
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.230
Yeah.

2901
01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:22.250
And it does make you feel,

2902
01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:22.460
you know,

2903
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.480
like if you're feeling shitty,

2904
01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:23.811
it's like,

2905
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:24.680
and you help someone,

2906
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:25.514
you feel better.

2907
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:26.270
Yes.

2908
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:28.220
Particularly if you steal from them while you're helping.

2909
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.350
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2910
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.090
I dunno man.

2911
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:37.260
<v 1>So it's just really nice to me to see someone kind of figure things out like</v>

2912
01:10:37.261 --> 01:10:38.520
that and like get a,

2913
01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:39.810
get a new perspective on things.

2914
01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:42.450
<v 3>These lessons like sure.</v>

2915
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.000
Over and over and over.

2916
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:45.690
I don't remember member who

2917
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:46.170
<v 1>said it,</v>

2918
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:49.170
but they said that inspiration is effective but it's like bathing.

2919
01:10:49.171 --> 01:10:50.310
It only lasts for so long.

2920
01:10:50.311 --> 01:10:51.780
That's why we recommend it daily.

2921
01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:52.560
Yeah.

2922
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.790
And the idea being that,

2923
01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.330
you know,

2924
01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:58.080
I guess it's easy to fall into a pattern of just not,

2925
01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.440
not having your shit together and not thinking right or you know,

2926
01:11:01.441 --> 01:11:04.740
letting yourself get jealous or letting yourself go down a negative way.

2927
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.370
You know,

2928
01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:05.961
people like this.

2929
01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.170
So this is a big cliche.

2930
01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:07.411
Like,

2931
01:11:07.411 --> 01:11:07.621
you know,

2932
01:11:07.621 --> 01:11:08.850
I'm just trying to keep it positive.

2933
01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:12.240
Just try to cute sometimes keep what really keeping it positive means is

2934
01:11:12.241 --> 01:11:14.430
addressing some shit that's not positive at all.

2935
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.061
You know,

2936
01:11:15.061 --> 01:11:15.220
and,

2937
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.610
and getting to know what the fuck is making you tick.

2938
01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:20.760
And if you find out that you're getting angry for someone else's success for no

2939
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:21.510
reason,

2940
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.470
it's like your,

2941
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:24.090
your brain knows you're talented,

2942
01:11:24.091 --> 01:11:24.331
you like,

2943
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:24.721
you know,

2944
01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:25.530
your telling.

2945
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:29.250
But why isn't anybody else seeing it instead of your brain using that resource

2946
01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:29.671
and going,

2947
01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:31.560
let's just make sure it's undeniable.

2948
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:32.071
Let's,

2949
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:35.190
let's just concentrate on being funnier and funnier until no one can say shit.

2950
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:35.610
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2951
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:35.821
well,

2952
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:37.320
it's the ant deniability thing,

2953
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.240
but I think also it's,

2954
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.590
for me,

2955
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:41.190
it's,

2956
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:44.910
it's very much like I have to be in touch with being humble.

2957
01:11:44.911 --> 01:11:46.740
I know this is sounding really corny.

2958
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:47.221
No,

2959
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:47.611
not like,

2960
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:51.390
usually when I'm angry is when I think I'm in control.

2961
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.710
I'm somehow like,

2962
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.920
I'm crazy enough to think that I can control the entertainment business or I can

2963
01:11:58.291 --> 01:11:59.460
control whether,

2964
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:00.240
you know,

2965
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.560
my flight's delayed,

2966
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.921
you know,

2967
01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:02.280
that,

2968
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:02.580
yeah.

2969
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.540
That's just insane.

2970
01:12:03.541 --> 01:12:03.681
You know,

2971
01:12:03.681 --> 01:12:03.901
it's like,

2972
01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:04.111
well,

2973
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:06.450
maybe if I'm angry to this flight attendant,

2974
01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:08.070
the plane will take off sooner.

2975
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:08.761
You know,

2976
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:09.011
it,

2977
01:12:09.011 --> 01:12:10.290
it doesn't make sense.

2978
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.540
So when I'm in touch with,

2979
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.040
uh,

2980
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:13.320
you know,

2981
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.071
being humble,

2982
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:14.310
it,

2983
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.690
it ends up paying off.

2984
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.141
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2985
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:17.560
That's a very important part of it.

2986
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:19.650
That's the 13th book of my series.

2987
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.251
Well,

2988
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:21.900
when we were talking about earlier about guys who,

2989
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:22.530
uh,

2990
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:24.120
went up stealing material and the,

2991
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.220
that stealing is the opposite of being humble.

2992
01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:26.391
You,

2993
01:12:26.391 --> 01:12:28.960
you want more credit for what you've achieved,

2994
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.390
what you've,

2995
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.223
you know,

2996
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.041
who you are,

2997
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:32.970
what you're selling.

2998
01:12:32.971 --> 01:12:33.630
You want it,

2999
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:35.310
you're pretending it's better than it really is.

3000
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.680
It's the exact opposite of humility and that is the exact wrong state of mind to

3001
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:41.850
be in for creativity.

3002
01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:43.470
I think that's,

3003
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:44.070
yeah,

3004
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.431
that's,

3005
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:46.350
that's so fucking awesome that you figured that out,

3006
01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:46.920
man.

3007
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.191
I,

3008
01:12:47.191 --> 01:12:47.550
um,

3009
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:50.100
I was a for sure at certain points of time,

3010
01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:50.731
early in my career,

3011
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:53.940
I really had a hard time enjoying comedy because,

3012
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:54.090
uh,

3013
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.880
when someone would kill you when someone was really good,

3014
01:12:56.881 --> 01:12:58.200
I would always thinking is,

3015
01:12:58.201 --> 01:12:58.561
man,

3016
01:12:58.561 --> 01:12:59.130
he better than me.

3017
01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:00.600
Fuck I in up better than me,

3018
01:13:00.601 --> 01:13:01.140
man.

3019
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:01.800
Fuck it.

3020
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.451
How good is that?

3021
01:13:02.451 --> 01:13:03.720
That guy's got a pretty fucking good,

3022
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:07.680
like it bother me that something was good and I couldn't just enjoy it.

3023
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:09.240
I couldn't just sit back and watch.

3024
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:11.400
It took a while before I figured that out,

3025
01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:11.720
let it,

3026
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.200
that that was holding me back,

3027
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.800
that I would work with people and if they were really good I would get nervous,

3028
01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:17.491
you know,

3029
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:19.560
instead of the way I do it now,

3030
01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:23.910
I bring like really funny people on the road with me on purpose because I want

3031
01:13:23.911 --> 01:13:24.960
to be laughing too.

3032
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:26.280
Like I want,

3033
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:26.491
you know,

3034
01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:26.731
when,

3035
01:13:26.731 --> 01:13:28.230
when I work with Ari Shaffir,

3036
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:32.610
I don't know him and Duncan Trussell and Joey DHEAS and Tom Segura all,

3037
01:13:32.611 --> 01:13:33.361
he's really funny guy.

3038
01:13:33.361 --> 01:13:34.260
So what?

3039
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:35.820
I'm sitting there waiting to go on stage.

3040
01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:39.270
I'm laughing my ass off and it puts me in the perfect state of mind.

3041
01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:41.250
Like I want them to be brilliant.

3042
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.360
I want them to kill.

3043
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.351
But when I was young,

3044
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:44.370
I was terrified of it.

3045
01:13:44.371 --> 01:13:46.050
I didn't want anybody else to be in a good,

3046
01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:49.620
I wanted them to be terrible so that I could fucking skate by on my,

3047
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.753
my shitty act.

3048
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.051
Yeah.

3049
01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:52.351
Well,

3050
01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:55.140
and it's amazing how alerts

3051
01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:57.780
<v 3>and I think it's,</v>

3052
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.810
I think it's insane how I think podcasts are making comedians.

3053
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.560
Like it's,

3054
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:06.060
it's siphoning out,

3055
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:06.421
I mean,

3056
01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:08.370
I'm a joke Smith and it's,

3057
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.390
it's adding,

3058
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.373
um,

3059
01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.101
you know,

3060
01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:16.340
discourse or kind of reflection back into stand up.

3061
01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:17.080
Right?

3062
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.250
Whereas it used to be like,

3063
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:19.810
what's the deal with keys?

3064
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:20.644
Right.

3065
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.110
And so now it's,

3066
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.250
I feel like,

3067
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:24.731
I dunno,

3068
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:25.541
maybe I'm wrong,

3069
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:26.440
but you know,

3070
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.950
it's,

3071
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:30.670
it's like podcasts are influencing some of this,

3072
01:14:30.671 --> 01:14:30.941
you know,

3073
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:32.630
it's like Pete Holmes even said that to me.

3074
01:14:32.631 --> 01:14:35.410
He said that his podcast is changing his act.

3075
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:36.491
And I'm like,

3076
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:37.570
that makes sense.

3077
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:38.411
It's,

3078
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:42.760
it's gotta be so fun to like when you hear a bit and then you can go,

3079
01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:43.594
you know what?

3080
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.111
Cause you know,

3081
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:45.340
when you hang around some friends,

3082
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:45.551
you know,

3083
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:46.570
like three in the morning,

3084
01:14:46.571 --> 01:14:48.160
you don't have someone recording it.

3085
01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:48.431
Right,

3086
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:48.591
right,

3087
01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:48.780
right.

3088
01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.320
Like when you're doing a podcast and you're like,

3089
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:52.300
go back to like that in the middle.

3090
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:54.040
I said something funny.

3091
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:54.940
That can be a bit,

3092
01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:55.803
that might be a bit,

3093
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:56.320
Oh yeah,

3094
01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.360
I've definitely come up with some beds from the podcasts.

3095
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:59.570
100% for sure.

3096
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:00.430
Yeah.

3097
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.740
I mean you're talking three hours at a pop,

3098
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:03.041
you know,

3099
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:03.820
many times.

3100
01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:04.081
We,

3101
01:15:04.081 --> 01:15:05.590
we've done many three hour ones.

3102
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.970
We did a Kevin Smith one,

3103
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:08.160
I think there was a longest one we ever did,

3104
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.070
like three and a half hours.

3105
01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:09.670
Yeah.

3106
01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:11.290
That's probably the only things to Twitter to,

3107
01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:12.190
for reminding you.

3108
01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:12.381
You know,

3109
01:15:12.381 --> 01:15:12.731
it'd be like,

3110
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:14.080
like you'll say something and be like,

3111
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.471
Oh shit,

3112
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:15.400
I did say that.

3113
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.210
Oh I don't,

3114
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:18.010
Twitter is amazing.

3115
01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:18.923
It's amazing.

3116
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.380
Twitter is changing.

3117
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:20.860
How,

3118
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:25.860
I mean I've done things on Twitter and I remember like a year ago I did some

3119
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:30.931
jokes cause we just had a kid and I was driving to do a show and uh,

3120
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:32.770
the guy who was opening,

3121
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:33.580
he was like,

3122
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.920
you're going to put those in your act,

3123
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:35.170
aren't you?

3124
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:35.770
And I was like,

3125
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.180
I didn't even think of that.

3126
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.021
And he was like,

3127
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:38.854
yeah.

3128
01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.960
And it's like they're great jokes.

3129
01:15:40.961 --> 01:15:41.794
Like,

3130
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.500
and now like Twitter is this source of like,

3131
01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:45.221
is this funny?

3132
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:45.670
I mean,

3133
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:46.030
yeah,

3134
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:47.410
99% of the time.

3135
01:15:47.411 --> 01:15:47.801
No,

3136
01:15:47.801 --> 01:15:50.780
but if you can get two great lines,

3137
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.630
open up a topic,

3138
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.920
well you're going to get them.

3139
01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:54.300
You're,

3140
01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.040
you're going to get some tweets from this podcast for sure.

3141
01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.950
Where Pete people will quit tweet quotes that you said laugh.

3142
01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:01.991
That happens all the time.

3143
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:02.141
Right.

3144
01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:04.840
And you'll forget even said it and then someone will tweet it.

3145
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:05.890
That's fun.

3146
01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:06.251
What do you,

3147
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:07.210
what's your numbers now?

3148
01:16:07.211 --> 01:16:07.540
Would you,

3149
01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.950
what do you have the numbers?

3150
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:10.390
Numbers for your Twitter followers?

3151
01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.120
So funny.

3152
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:14.770
It's like follow every day.

3153
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.560
There's like a strange obsession.

3154
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:19.570
It's like it's nine,

3155
01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:22.600
I think it's nine 60 something,

3156
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:23.570
but I'm getting close.

3157
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:28.000
96 960960900 60,000 holy shit.

3158
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.631
But I've,

3159
01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:29.560
I've been working,

3160
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.000
I've been working,

3161
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:31.300
you're,

3162
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.860
you can also hire a million,

3163
01:16:32.861 --> 01:16:33.730
you're going to feel different.

3164
01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:35.140
You know,

3165
01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:35.650
it's,

3166
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:36.280
you know,

3167
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:41.280
I've only over the past month or two started to even have conversations on

3168
01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:42.100
there.

3169
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:42.701
Like first of all,

3170
01:16:42.701 --> 01:16:43.720
I initially I was like,

3171
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:45.100
I'm not going to have a conversation.

3172
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.480
Like there's Twitter things,

3173
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:47.201
we should go over this.

3174
01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:48.034
And then I,

3175
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.630
but here's the first one.

3176
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:51.310
The first one is,

3177
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.120
um,

3178
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.710
and some of my friends do this,

3179
01:16:53.711 --> 01:16:54.521
so it's like,

3180
01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:56.140
it's like to each their own.

3181
01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.270
It's like when someone says,

3182
01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.193
uh,

3183
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:01.180
Jim Gaffigan was awesome tonight,

3184
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.673
you know,

3185
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:03.671
pardon me.

3186
01:17:03.671 --> 01:17:05.860
The desire is to retweet that.

3187
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.420
But that's almost bragging.

3188
01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:08.280
Yeah.

3189
01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.560
You get a humble for that.

3190
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:10.423
Right.

3191
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:13.100
And so then there's the,

3192
01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:13.953
uh,

3193
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:16.010
um,

3194
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.791
there's that.

3195
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.560
And then there's even having converse,

3196
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:23.590
like I had always wanted my timeline to just be jokes,

3197
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.791
just jokes,

3198
01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:26.170
you know,

3199
01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:26.400
uh,

3200
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:26.780
you know,

3201
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.940
like maybe it may be at,

3202
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.510
you know,

3203
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.901
uh,

3204
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:31.250
an appearance page lists,

3205
01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:31.431
you know,

3206
01:17:31.431 --> 01:17:31.701
it's like,

3207
01:17:31.701 --> 01:17:32.600
I'll be in Tampa,

3208
01:17:32.601 --> 01:17:32.811
blah,

3209
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:33.440
blah blah.

3210
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:33.951
By the way,

3211
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:37.190
I will be in five on June 2nd.

3212
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:37.880
No,

3213
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.490
and so because Jim gaffigan.com,

3214
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.190
Jim gaffigan.com and uh,

3215
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.290
so I would do that,

3216
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.860
but there's also something insane about that cause it's,

3217
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.900
there is something social and there,

3218
01:17:50.901 --> 01:17:51.171
you know,

3219
01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:52.850
if your friend says something funny,

3220
01:17:52.851 --> 01:17:54.410
it would be fun to response.

3221
01:17:54.411 --> 01:17:56.540
So I've just been doing that for the past two months.

3222
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:58.850
But how many people do you follow?

3223
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.313
<v 1>I follow a lot.</v>

3224
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.590
I follow a lot too.

3225
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.110
I follow over a thousand.

3226
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:04.281
It kind of sucks.

3227
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:06.470
I've been thinking about it like cutting my numbers down lately,

3228
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.020
but there's so many people are like,

3229
01:18:09.021 --> 01:18:09.231
dude,

3230
01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:10.064
I told you about the,

3231
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.170
I tweeted it like for a week and I've cut,

3232
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.430
I've cut a few celebrities.

3233
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:16.230
I was following some celebrities as a goof and it just,

3234
01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.390
just more onyx shit over and over again and I'd get crazy and I'd have to delete

3235
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:20.510
it.

3236
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.880
Well,

3237
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.713
if this is a help,

3238
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:24.020
but I also feel like that's,

3239
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.930
that's kind of like inviting someone to dinner and then saying,

3240
01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:27.980
sorry you can't come,

3241
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:28.640
isn't it?

3242
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.270
I don't know.

3243
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.691
No,

3244
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:32.300
it's like people unfollow me all the time.

3245
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.310
Especially like really douchey people.

3246
01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:34.791
I was like,

3247
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:38.690
I'm sure like some woman will will get mad at my not wanting women to be running

3248
01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:39.524
things right.

3249
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.401
Quote about that early.

3250
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:42.100
You fucking sexist pig by the way.

3251
01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:46.310
That all came from watching a woman yell and scream at a guy yesterday.

3252
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.200
He's pointing his face and the ridiculous situation where I thought it could

3253
01:18:51.201 --> 01:18:53.150
escalate to violence and I might have to step in.

3254
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:54.260
It was like kind of craziness.

3255
01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:54.650
Right.

3256
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:56.630
So that's just the origin of that.

3257
01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.051
So,

3258
01:18:57.051 --> 01:18:57.211
you know,

3259
01:18:57.211 --> 01:18:58.044
but uh,

3260
01:18:58.770 --> 01:18:59.571
well maybe not really.

3261
01:18:59.571 --> 01:19:00.740
Maybe I just made that up to you.

3262
01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:01.180
Don't know.

3263
01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.013
We don't know.

3264
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:02.570
I don't know.

3265
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:06.620
But we're going to agree with you because we're sitting in a room with you.

3266
01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.070
<v 3>But what was the thing about the Twitter thing?</v>

3267
01:19:11.071 --> 01:19:11.700
It,

3268
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.331
how about this?

3269
01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:13.500
How about like when you have like,

3270
01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:14.340
you know,

3271
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.360
a comedian,

3272
01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:19.170
you know there's friends and then there's peers that you kind of know,

3273
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:19.500
right?

3274
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:19.891
And you'd be like,

3275
01:19:19.891 --> 01:19:20.071
Hey,

3276
01:19:20.071 --> 01:19:20.271
you know,

3277
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:22.890
I'm going to send them a direct message and then you realize they don't follow

3278
01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:23.101
you.

3279
01:19:23.101 --> 01:19:24.210
Isn't there a little bit like,

3280
01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:25.080
really?

3281
01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:25.620
Yeah.

3282
01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.453
<v 1>Well you don't follow me.</v>

3283
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.200
I've done that accidentally though.

3284
01:19:28.201 --> 01:19:29.011
And I apologize.

3285
01:19:29.011 --> 01:19:31.920
Like I didn't realize I wasn't following somebody and in this pit people that I

3286
01:19:31.921 --> 01:19:32.960
knew I was following there,

3287
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:33.840
for some reason it wasn't.

3288
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:34.860
I've had Twitter.

3289
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.600
<v 3>Twitter's been doing that a lot lately.</v>

3290
01:19:36.601 --> 01:19:37.680
And I think it's the iPhone.

3291
01:19:37.681 --> 01:19:38.820
I think if you have the iPhone,

3292
01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:42.090
you'll have the app open and then you could easily like hit it.

3293
01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:43.050
Oh you know,

3294
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:44.500
follow unfollow someone.

3295
01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:46.290
Cause it happens to me all the time.

3296
01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:47.500
<v 1>You know what else has happened,</v>

3297
01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:47.771
you know,

3298
01:19:47.771 --> 01:19:50.290
I used to have a blackberry and I had an iPhone at the same time.

3299
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.760
And when I had my blackberry I would go on and check a direct message on Twitter

3300
01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:55.810
and then I would go,

3301
01:19:55.811 --> 01:19:56.620
I've got to get,

3302
01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.390
I've got to respond to that eventually,

3303
01:19:58.391 --> 01:19:59.470
but I don't have time right now.

3304
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.040
And then I would go check it online and there'd be no direct message.

3305
01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:04.420
It wouldn't exist anymore.

3306
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.880
<v 3>Well I do,</v>

3307
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.571
I didn't know that.

3308
01:20:06.571 --> 01:20:08.100
If they a

3309
01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.391
<v 0>text message,</v>

3310
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:10.080
it deletes it.

3311
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.400
Oh and unethically and everything though.

3312
01:20:12.401 --> 01:20:14.790
Somebody could send it to you think that you didn't respond,

3313
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:15.421
just delete it.

3314
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:16.210
Yeah.

3315
01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:18.690
And then there's another thing I like go in your book.

3316
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:19.321
If you,

3317
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:22.410
if you go to somebody's page and it says that you're not following them,

3318
01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:26.160
if you hit refresh a lot of times and then it will say you're falling.

3319
01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:26.401
I'm like,

3320
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:29.160
it just doesn't show up that you're following up.

3321
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:30.960
And so then you might click it thinking like,

3322
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.231
ah,

3323
01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:34.080
I thought it was [inaudible] and that's unfolding you on.

3324
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:35.070
Are you kidding me?

3325
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:35.510
Yeah.

3326
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:36.343
So anytime you,

3327
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:42.000
it's like I exist with enough guilt already.

3328
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.450
You know?

3329
01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:44.281
It's so,

3330
01:20:44.281 --> 01:20:44.640
anyway,

3331
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.091
I got it.

3332
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.290
I eventually sent to go.

3333
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.760
You gotta get Outta here right now?

3334
01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.090
Yeah.

3335
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:48.923
What time is it?

3336
01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.340
Eight eight 17 or listen to you sexy bitch.

3337
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:54.600
This was fun though.

3338
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:54.961
Thank you.

3339
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:55.590
Anytime.

3340
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:56.371
Please come by.

3341
01:20:56.371 --> 01:20:57.151
You're awesome man.

3342
01:20:57.151 --> 01:20:58.560
Anytime you want to do it please.

3343
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.270
Or how often are you out here in la?

3344
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:01.104
Not that often.

3345
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:01.661
You live in,

3346
01:21:01.661 --> 01:21:02.850
in New York City kids.

3347
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.900
Four kids.

3348
01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:04.860
You live in Manhattan.

3349
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.731
Wow.

3350
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:08.910
What does that like with four kids living in my head it's like really hard.

3351
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.571
Yeah.

3352
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:10.330
I would say.

3353
01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:10.651
How do you,

3354
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:11.550
where do you do with them?

3355
01:21:11.551 --> 01:21:12.384
How do you take them?

3356
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.640
And we live in a two bedroom.

3357
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.750
Holy Shit.

3358
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:16.200
Yeah.

3359
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:16.650
So,

3360
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:17.070
wow.

3361
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:19.110
And that's probably $100,000 a month,

3362
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:19.351
right?

3363
01:21:19.351 --> 01:21:20.184
It's

3364
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.350
fucking ridiculous.

3365
01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:23.483
It's insane.

3366
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.200
It's just the craziest way to live.

3367
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.190
I'm sure my apartment is like half the size of your garage.

3368
01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.000
Wow.

3369
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:30.661
That's ridiculous.

3370
01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:32.280
And you must pay a shit load for it to,

3371
01:21:32.281 --> 01:21:32.610
right?

3372
01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:32.911
Well,

3373
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:33.420
yeah.

3374
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:33.870
Yeah.

3375
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:36.450
But if a friend has got a $4 million apartment and I was like,

3376
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:37.590
this is $4 million,

3377
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.360
this is $4 million.

3378
01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:44.020
This is like 1600 bucks a month in Burbank is $4 million in New York.

3379
01:21:44.021 --> 01:21:45.270
Cause this fucking craziness.

3380
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.200
It's craziness.

3381
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:47.530
It moved to the west coast.

3382
01:21:47.531 --> 01:21:48.420
Want to start a podcast?

3383
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:48.770
Yeah,

3384
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:49.110
dude,

3385
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:50.100
if you ever want to come out here,

3386
01:21:50.101 --> 01:21:50.400
man,

3387
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.240
he was too pale.

3388
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:52.383
Ranier Shit,

3389
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:52.831
I don't,

3390
01:21:52.831 --> 01:21:53.640
I'm not a drunk.

3391
01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.890
I got a criers.

3392
01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.600
You couldn't imagine the amount of anxiety when I was like,

3393
01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.620
oh the five's the one 34 to,

3394
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:04.230
I don't drive marijuana in and navigation system and you'll be fine.

3395
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:05.220
Don't worry about it.

3396
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.150
It's all figured out.

3397
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.080
He'll never have to worry about how to drive.

3398
01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:09.780
So with your family.

3399
01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.030
Okay.

3400
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:13.760
You can't say that you would never,

3401
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.600
you could never live here because of the sun,

3402
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:16.600
because you wouldn't be outdoors.

3403
01:22:16.601 --> 01:22:17.550
So I did a ginger.

3404
01:22:17.551 --> 01:22:17.810
She,

3405
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:18.421
it's fine.

3406
01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:19.380
She's wears big hats.

3407
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:19.621
Yeah,

3408
01:22:19.621 --> 01:22:20.251
you'd be fine,

3409
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:20.461
dude.

3410
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:21.130
You can do it.

3411
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:21.330
Well,

3412
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:21.811
I don't know.

3413
01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:22.201
I'm scared.

3414
01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:23.310
I'm scared of the sun for real.

3415
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:23.641
No.

3416
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:25.440
You know what I,

3417
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.490
some of it is,

3418
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:28.110
I think the entertainment business.

3419
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.090
I don't know if I want to be that deep end to it.

3420
01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:30.330
Yeah,

3421
01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:31.163
you're probably right.

3422
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.070
I know that mean.

3423
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:34.680
We mean you can live in a completely different world.

3424
01:22:34.681 --> 01:22:35.400
In New York,

3425
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.720
people are for sure.

3426
01:22:36.721 --> 01:22:41.080
The cat's formed the caste system that exists and it would,

3427
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:42.120
oh,

3428
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.241
oh,

3429
01:22:42.241 --> 01:22:43.470
he's on a network show,

3430
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:47.210
so he gets to go here and then here's an indie actor.

3431
01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.750
So he jumps over you.

3432
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.111
Oh,

3433
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:49.944
you're a comedian.

3434
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.810
You can go back there with the mines.

3435
01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.320
Is that how you feel when you're out here?

3436
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.750
I think that there is a hierarchy here.

3437
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.261
Well,

3438
01:22:58.261 --> 01:23:00.000
I think that if you came out here,

3439
01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:00.843
just vow.

3440
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:02.240
Mostly I say Jim Gaffigan,

3441
01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.800
this is what you could do if you came out here and started a fucking podcast and

3442
01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:06.210
you devolve

3443
01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:08.650
<v 1>the comics that around here where you could actually even do this in New York if</v>

3444
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.484
you want to do,

3445
01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:09.881
but your,

3446
01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:11.230
you would have a huge podcast.

3447
01:23:11.231 --> 01:23:12.370
I think it would be enormous and it would,

3448
01:23:12.371 --> 01:23:13.510
I think would change everything.

3449
01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:16.420
Change how you promote your club dates,

3450
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:16.631
your,

3451
01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:16.931
your,

3452
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:17.201
your,

3453
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.370
your theater gigs,

3454
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:19.383
anything you're doing.

3455
01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:21.280
It'd be amazing for sure.

3456
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:23.180
Easily people would right away you would,

3457
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.960
you'd be in the top.

3458
01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:27.310
You'd be in the top five squad.

3459
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.440
You'd be in the top five in iTunes right away.

3460
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:33.730
I'm 100% you'd be and I would think that you'd be one of the few people that

3461
01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:34.130
would say,

3462
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:36.010
subscribe how you perfect for this man.

3463
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.570
I could do it with my wife that she's,

3464
01:23:37.571 --> 01:23:37.961
yeah,

3465
01:23:37.961 --> 01:23:38.731
that's not a bad idea.

3466
01:23:38.731 --> 01:23:40.030
Tom Sigora does it with his wife.

3467
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.460
That only works out 50% of the time.

3468
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:43.930
It only works about 50% of the time.

3469
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.201
Well,

3470
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:45.730
you mean with fit with couples,

3471
01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:48.700
you don't mean like Tom Segura this shit.

3472
01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.360
Nine bucks.

3473
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:49.930
Half the time.

3474
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.500
I'm just saying with couples.

3475
01:23:51.501 --> 01:23:52.420
So let's just be clear.

3476
01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:52.810
Yeah.

3477
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:52.991
Yeah.

3478
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:53.770
Most of the time they,

3479
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:54.730
it crosses breakup.

3480
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.350
So either way it's a win.

3481
01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:57.221
It's a win.

3482
01:23:57.221 --> 01:23:57.850
Win.

3483
01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:58.300
All right,

3484
01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.200
Jim Gaffigan,

3485
01:23:59.201 --> 01:23:59.771
ladies and gentlemen,

3486
01:23:59.771 --> 01:24:01.780
and you can get his special when and how?

3487
01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:04.450
April 11th April 11th $5.

3488
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.850
Five bucks at Jim Gaffigan.

3489
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.940

Dude,

3492
01:24:12.251 --> 01:24:13.210
you're the fucking man.

3493
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:13.810
It wasn't,

3494
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:16.670
will it be available on iTunes or Amazon or any of those choices?

3495
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.080
Gap.

3496
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:17.490
Just him.

3497
01:24:17.490 --> 01:24:17.680
Yeah.

3498
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.010
Okay,

3499
01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:18.460
cool.

3500
01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.090
Awesome.

3501
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:19.901
Thank you very much for coming,

3502
01:24:19.901 --> 01:24:20.734
sir.

3503
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:22.083
It's a fun,

3504
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:22.390
yeah,

3505
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.340
it's always fun to have a comedy,

3506
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:25.310
especially the comment that I don't really get a chance to talk to you,

3507
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.110
so it was fun.

3508
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.610
Really cool.

3509
01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:26.841
Yeah.

3510
01:24:26.841 --> 01:24:27.600
Really cool.

3511
01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.060

That's a kid.

3521
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:41.531
Now.

3522
01:24:41.531 --> 01:24:42.310
She's a grown woman.

3523
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.581
Actually.

3524
01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:43.360
She's just very,

3525
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.140
she calls herself a little tattled on me for parking at the Oh,

3526
01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:47.060
a little lesser.

3527
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:48.550
Why don't you go negative on me?
