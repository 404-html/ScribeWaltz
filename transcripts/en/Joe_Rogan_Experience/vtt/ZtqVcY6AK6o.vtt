WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>The general experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys aren't woke once.</v>

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's all woke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be great.</v>

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous word to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people got to mock it in the</v>

5
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woke woke.</v>

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like using woke now like</v>

7
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>unironically super slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a trap coming.</v>

8
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The jujitsu practitioner in me is like,</v>

9
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>

10
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I know where this leads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I see that woke thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

12
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>what are you woke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does that even mean?</v>

13
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't look up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You woke up.</v>

14
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>What do you 12?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>it comes from my 16 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

16
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it's kids today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does it mean?</v>

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It means your brain is open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're open to stuff.</v>

18
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's no real</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantification.</v>

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no test you take to show that if</v>

20
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you're woke.</v>

21
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.463
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

22
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to be a mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the fucking show that you know</v>

23
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>how to do math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The professor said,</v>

24
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>check your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get through like,</v>

25
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations Tom.</v>

26
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a mathematician.</v>

27
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Phd In mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says right here on the paper and</v>

28
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:09.871
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>

29
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put this shit on my walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand?</v>

30
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I know how this stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but wokeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can claim to be a master of</v>

32
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>wokeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Kung Fu without fighting.</v>

33
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>No one's defined what's woke and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

35
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>No one's defined what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's just not racist and sexist and</v>

36
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>not homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but open minded and aware of the,</v>

37
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the failings and the misgivings of all</v>

38
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>sides of us and with no bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

39
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't seem like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that woke?</v>

41
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

42
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I think you just described what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was.</v>

43
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I would like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too many people could jump in.</v>

44
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real clear understanding of</v>

45
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>like what makes an constitutes someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>being woke like.</v>

46
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of those boxes do you have to</v>

47
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>check where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop Tom.</v>

48
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Papa had a woke academy and you took</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

49
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It would just mean to you like bread or</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread claiming wokeness super slippery.</v>

50
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>What's his Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>62 New York Times magazine or</v>

51
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>crazy gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dig It.</v>

52
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're woke,</v>

53
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost the perfect definition right</v>

54
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're woke,</v>

55
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>

56
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>That was my fox man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were copying my taste and grit.</v>

57
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't jump salty on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

58
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Look how they talked back then they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to talk people into talking the</v>

59
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>way that made them seem more</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

60
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it the way I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I lived back then.</v>

61
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it bigger so I can see why you'd be</v>

62
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>the guy on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

63
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

64
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scrolling.</v>

65
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So we could read the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying.</v>

66
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Up Top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

68
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>that was my facts man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were coding grace and grit.</v>

69
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>So how would you say that now?</v>

70
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That was my fox man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe cop in my taste.</v>

71
00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's girl on girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're saying no,</v>

72
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

73
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>would you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What words would you use today?</v>

74
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>He would say the fuck he doing with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>

76
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Dickhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

77
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>don't jump salty on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

78
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're cool.</v>

79
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>No worries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>

80
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Stop being such a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

81
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And then it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

83
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Someone's a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

84
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>people will be hitting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the darkest snowman.</v>

85
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is one very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important point that we need to move</v>

86
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>past the military gatekeepers of tech.</v>

87
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.210
<v Speaker 2>No</v>
<v Speaker 2>big tech which are at advertising</v>

88
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.500
<v Speaker 2>agencies in social media,</v>

89
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the things that are constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting your next purchase,</v>

90
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

92
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in even in a semi democracy look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have in the US,</v>

93
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean those who control the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brainwashing of the public in essence</v>

94
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>control who votes for what and who</v>
<v Speaker 2>controls the brainwashing of the public</v>

95
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>is advertising agencies and who</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly are the biggest advertising</v>

96
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>agencies are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the big tech companies who are</v>

97
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>accumulating everybody's data and using</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to,</v>

98
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>to program their minds to buy things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what's programmed the global</v>

99
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 2>brain of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

100
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 2>of the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course there are close links</v>

101
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.780
<v Speaker 2>between big tech and the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at.</v>

102
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Amazon has $25,000 person headquarters</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Crystal City,</v>

103
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Virginia right next to the Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in China it's even more direct and</v>

104
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 2>unapologetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

105
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:48.301
<v Speaker 2>So it's a new military industrial</v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising complex,</v>

106
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.360
<v Speaker 2>which is guiding the evolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>global brain on the planet,</v>

107
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.380
<v Speaker 1>which that with this past election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

108
00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:01.760
<v Speaker 1>with all the intrusion by foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities trying to influence the</v>

109
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:06.680
<v Speaker 1>election that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these giant houses set up to write bad</v>

110
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:10.580
<v Speaker 1>stories about whoever they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in office.</v>

111
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way that's almost a red herring,</v>

112
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Russian stuff is almost a red</v>

113
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>herring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it revealed what the processes are,</v>

114
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are used to program.</v>

115
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think the whatever programming</v>

116
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:31.111
<v Speaker 2>of the American's minds is done by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians is minuscule compared to the</v>

117
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 2>programming of Americans' minds by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American American corporate and</v>

118
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:38.330
<v Speaker 2>government elite.</v>

119
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.480

<v Speaker 1>my son and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do if you go back in</v>

<v Speaker 1>where would you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 hundreds.</v>

181
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.750
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in the 1900,</v>

182
00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like last week.</v>

183
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>And then I told him the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

184
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember I was little.</v>

185
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>My Dad used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to bring you on stage to do that.</v>

186
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like four or five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

187
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like four years old and he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick me up and carried me under the,</v>

188
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>under the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

189
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>And one time he brings me on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

190
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>this is my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he presents me in the spotlight's on</v>

191
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm shy.</v>

192
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was kind of disappointed,</v>

193
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>really disappointed me that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

194
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks later I was with him</v>

195
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:38.774
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

196
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>me on stage and um,</v>

198
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.230
<v Speaker 1>he's about to pick me up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could walk away and I go back to my</v>

199
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:48.690
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>

200
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved it.</v>

201
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 1>He loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I told my son that story.</v>

202
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he people afterwards,</v>

203
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.780
<v Speaker 1>we walked through the hotel to go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has me on his shoulders and he's</v>

204
00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:56.521
<v Speaker 1>just so proud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

205
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>you see my boy and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I told my son about that and my son was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

207
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it was like 40 minutes later in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and my son is like that.</v>

208
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>If I had a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go back and hang out with you when</v>

209
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:09.520
<v Speaker 1>your dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>

210
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>that was like the best moment of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

211
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Message it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's done.</v>

212
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>You examine your fucking brain and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes some hard work and suffering.</v>

213
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>If you're not really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

214
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like there's no way to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a bystander.</v>

215
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this hurts real fucking bad.</v>

218
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.870

<v Speaker 1>And then guess what happens?</v>

219
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>The body will just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will adjust if it goes well.</v>

220
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Then the next question again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but time when it doesn't adjust to I</v>

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.310
<v Speaker 1>The mind is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's powerful,</v>

236
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

237
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 1>But people need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need a thing to get them going.</v>

238
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need a thing,</v>

239
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a goal.</v>

240
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.660
<v Speaker 1>They need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need A.</v>

241
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes the first step is the</v>

242
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to take that 1 million,</v>

243
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>step two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the first step is the Mo</v>

244
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>is something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>

245
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 1>They start going over their phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start calling people.</v>

246
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:49.131
<v Speaker 1>They don't get out of the house and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about procrastination.</v>

247
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:51.661
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you should be doing things,</v>

249
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.650
<v Speaker 1>but you just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep itching that</v>

250
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I procrastinate like a motherfucker man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day I want to do this shit.</v>

251
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

252
00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:10.000
<v Speaker 1>People looking like on some damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero that came down from the Gods,</v>

253
00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:12.040
<v Speaker 1>from the heavens and earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Man,</v>

254
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes.</v>

255
00:11:18.341 --> 00:11:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they can fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

256
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.190
<v Speaker 1>People look up to your Goggins fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

257
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

258
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.290
<v Speaker 1>do this shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do it?</v>

259
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it as long as you do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I know about it.</v>

260
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why I stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

261
00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gonna fucking sit here and you look</v>

262
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:37.730
<v Speaker 1>at your shoes for 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes.</v>

263
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.850
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think about all day long you</v>

264
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 1>go do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you don't have the time to</v>

265
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.050
<v Speaker 1>look issues for 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the,</v>

266
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.700
<v Speaker 1>those are the beautiful days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

267
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:47.241
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:48.650
<v Speaker 1>you just have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

269
00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>And so like there's no room for</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastination and that's when I,</v>

270
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 1>when I was in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my because I knew it'd be work at</v>

271
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>7:00.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to get your ass up at 4:00.</v>

272
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Marissa get your shit in brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had to get my shit and before</v>

273
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I got my shit in know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was my mentality back then.</v>

274
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

275
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I had to get the miles and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in man and,</v>

276
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>and get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

277
