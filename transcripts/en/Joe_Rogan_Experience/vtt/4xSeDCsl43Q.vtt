00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 1>This podcast will be a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just prepare yourself.</v>

2
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're an MMA journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put you're a gate.</v>

3
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You're weightlifting chalk on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

4
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Get ready bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm full of opinions.</v>

5
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:26.771
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had those fucking keyboards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is essentially sort of a preview of</v>

6
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>this weekend's fights are really just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to get together and fuck around.</v>

7
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I was telling him was a breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was told to breakdown.</v>

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I've studied all night for a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my notes.</v>

9
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I was told this is a breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts,</v>

10
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you asked.</v>

11
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me,</v>

12
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with Nate Diaz now asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>the way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

16
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.193
<v Speaker 1>Connor's boxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The daylights had everybody who for the </v>

17
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>most part either has his reach or </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest.</v>

18
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>When he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hangs on the edge of the pocket.</v>

19
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>He hangs in the age of the pocket and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a counter puncher.</v>

20
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Weights to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commit slips and hits.</v>

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.720
<v Speaker 1>He's dealing with something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different with nate,</v>

22
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:09.554
<v Speaker 1>which is that nate is longer and taller </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nate doesn't have to do that and I </v>

23
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:13.544
<v Speaker 1>wonder what he's going to have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>either one of two things is going to </v>

24
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>have to weave and get inside or because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nate stands so you know,</v>

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sort of squares up with you.</v>

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could back kick in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick is his body,</v>

27
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>but connor doesn't kick like it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think.</v>

28
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch out for connor.</v>

29
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Connor's a heart kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

30
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>So he actually takes pretty good kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good kid.</v>

31
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.543
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen much of him because he's </v>

32
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>smoking everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but native,</v>

33
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.583
<v Speaker 1>very durable guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spends a lot of time in those gyms </v>

34
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of those Mexican boxers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand in the hole and just bang,</v>

35
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>which is encounter.</v>

36
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

37
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.594
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how common is going to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to change a little bit of his </v>

38
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>boxing and I'm curious to see how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

39
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.683
<v Speaker 1>He's only fought one guy that's tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Max Holloway and he's </v>

40
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.653
<v Speaker 1>coincidentally the one guy that went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a decision with him and he was also </v>

41
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:02.474
<v Speaker 1>hurting that he hurt his knee in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight during the fight when he was </v>

42
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>passing the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blew out his acl,</v>

43
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>so that definitely had a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge effect,</v>

44
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think that you make some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

45
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I think a dos Anjos showed a bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueprint on how to beat nate and one of</v>

46
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 1>the big things is that nate stance real </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy on that front leg.</v>

47
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>He comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fires that hard,</v>

48
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:26.684
<v Speaker 1>right jab and stands real heavy on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>front leg and dos Anjos just lift that </v>

49
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:31.004
<v Speaker 1>leg up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lit his legs up and because of that </v>

50
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>boxing centered style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me nate will throw the occasional kick,</v>

51
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>but primarily he fights boxing when he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting his boxing.</v>

52
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is very sharp.</v>

53
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 1>He boxed up gray maynard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He boxed up Marcus Davis and Michael.</v>

54
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson.</v>

55
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 1>His last fight was one of his best </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

56
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.803
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson head kicked and knocked </v>

57
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:52.814
<v Speaker 1>him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a different.</v>

59
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>That was Josh Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

60
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd do a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a series of injuries,</v>

61
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but I still maintain</v>

62
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the best lightweight in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

63
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>especially when it was in strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

64
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 2>well he's getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

65
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 2>The issue is he's like 36 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

66
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that Matt Connors met </v>

68
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:14.100
<v Speaker 2>anyone yet who's has got a boxer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A snake because no good.</v>

69
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Max.</v>

70
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Max back then was like,</v>

71
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.913
<v Speaker 2>it was two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago plus Max was not as good </v>

72
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>as he is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Confident Max is on fire right now.</v>

73
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway is on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see him and conor fight.</v>

74
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

75
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.883
<v Speaker 2>See I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that conor really </v>

76
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 2>wants that 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight class anymore.</v>

77
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean he looks so big right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has it and I think,</v>

78
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I think at 55 fighting dose Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the fight at UFC 200.</v>

79
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>So if he gets past it actually is kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of interesting.</v>

80
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>If he gets past Nadya's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 2>because it makes that fight bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight at 200,</v>

82
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>it really makes it more build up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:55.444
<v Speaker 2>dos Anjos broke his foot in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute of the last round of sparring to </v>

84
00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.853
<v Speaker 2>a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get the high level a </v>

85
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer and check the kid broke his </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot,</v>

86
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but we use the same as seuss and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course you know,</v>

87
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I get the text message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like fuck,</v>

88
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 2>this happened exactly last minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last round kind of thing.</v>

89
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the kings.</v>

90
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:14.690
<v Speaker 2>They go hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

91
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 2>They're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they were what's like a Shin Pad?</v>

92
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.724
<v Speaker 2>So it's over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your heart and a kickbox is </v>

93
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>checking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kick as hard as he does and you kick</v>

94
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 2>a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to fucking break your foot.</v>

95
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we know what Nate Diaz is gonna </v>

96
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 2>bring to the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think connor knows.</v>

97
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone in this room knows what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to do.</v>

98
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what Congress really going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

99
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Really haven't seen all his tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

100
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.123
<v Speaker 2>I think Diaz is the perfect match up so </v>
<v Speaker 2>he can showcase all his tools because </v>

101
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Diaz isn't easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's gonna get murdered in</v>

102
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.174
<v Speaker 2>the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see a lot of connor and </v>

103
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.124
<v Speaker 2>what he brings to the table for connor's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at lowering you with those </v>

104
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:56.671
<v Speaker 2>kicks and then stepping in with that big</v>
<v Speaker 2>lefthand had left hand is just a monster</v>

105
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 2>punch from heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

106
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 2>He just throws it so perfect and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got so much power behind it,</v>

107
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.750
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to hit nate Diaz.</v>

108
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Clean Heart and clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's tall,</v>

109
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.603
<v Speaker 2>he's slick.</v>

110
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 2>He just moves a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

111
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>It's hard because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His range is good.</v>

112
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 2>He's also good at ducking under shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

113
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>he's good at anticipating here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

114
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be interesting.</v>

115
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.214
<v Speaker 2>I think man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if nate diaz got to like a serious </v>

116
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Moitai camp and really learn how to kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>

117
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.933
<v Speaker 2>made more distance and then through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasional fucking take down attempt in </v>

118
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:32.021
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

119
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:32.854
<v Speaker 2>I think with a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the issues is they got a great </v>

120
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>formula and that formula is winning </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights and it can,</v>

121
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 2>it can carry them very far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it the best strategy?</v>

122
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 2>The best strategy is the guy you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

123
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have any idea what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're about to do.</v>

124
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.653
<v Speaker 2>That's the George St Pierre Strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George would just mix it up so well and </v>

125
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it was like one of his best assets.</v>

126
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 2>You really didn't know what his attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be with these guys.</v>

127
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:56.561
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 2>what their tax can it be with nate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice attack's going to be.</v>

129
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's a fucking good attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good attack.</v>

130
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.240
<v Speaker 2>But I think we're seeing the changing of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guard.</v>

131
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.074
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing these athletes like luke </v>

132
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 2>rockhold is just a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conor mcgregor,</v>

133
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 2>these guys who can do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have the old guard with,</v>

134
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

135
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hating on these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was one of the old guards.</v>

136
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestle box,</v>

138
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 2>didn't do a lot of kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew a lot of kicks.</v>

139
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>You look at Rashad Evans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really not kickboxer good at wrestling,</v>

140
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:24.104
<v Speaker 2>good at box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know who's gonna bring to the </v>

141
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a big head kick knock out.</v>

142
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.674
<v Speaker 2>And Sean Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like one of his true biggest </v>

143
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>highlight reel for sure.</v>

144
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how long ago was that?</v>

145
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.893
<v Speaker 2>Long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would've thought that that would </v>

146
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 2>have been a bigger part of his arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can do.</v>

147
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.723
<v Speaker 2>He's athletic enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Ain't get a guy like Ryan Bader </v>

148
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 2>wrestler box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have this old guard.</v>

149
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 2>The new guys coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

150
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have it all good luck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

151
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 2>And they're tossing these guys up who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are phenomenal fighters.</v>

152
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:48.974
<v Speaker 2>They have these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fan base and stuff like that and </v>

153
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.454
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're giving it to these young </v>

154
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 2>athletic guys and good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that would that skillset,</v>

155
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.441
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

156
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.274
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sport is just still evolving and </v>

157
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>we're in the middle of it and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it happen,</v>

158
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.553
<v Speaker 2>but it's still all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still like your weight class is a </v>

159
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your weight class,</v>

160
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>you cannot be one dimensional.</v>

161
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>You can close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one you can't do it.</v>

162
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an option.</v>

163
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 2>There's no one who one dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's anywhere near the top 10 where you</v>

164
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 2>have maybe out of the top five say for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me the most one dimensional or pseudo.</v>

165
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are they really,</v>

166
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it gives us amazing ground guy,</v>

167
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 2>but he tries to kick box everybody's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows the wrestler,</v>

168
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>but he's trying to punch a hole in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

169
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.813
<v Speaker 2>So fucking striking is not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who does try our very sharp slow for </v>

170
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.394
<v Speaker 2>the weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so strong and he does negate </v>

171
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:40.904
<v Speaker 2>the gap very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that he takes care of his </v>

172
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:46.274
<v Speaker 2>lack of speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you fight someone like </v>

173
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Demetrius where everything is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

174
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I think he's still too </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow to beat demetrious.</v>

175
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be an interesting fight.</v>

176
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a real interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

177
00:07:56.251 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a guy was a Olympic</v>

178
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>gold medalist and wrestling and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker with his mindset,</v>

179
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 2>his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He mean he is a winter,</v>

180
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 2>so who was just a straight up wait up </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

181
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 2>All those Olympic athletes that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the UFC,</v>

182
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 2>they were all pretty successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

183
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.070
<v Speaker 2>They think about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Got Dan Henderson a DC,</v>

184
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 2>so huda off obviously Ronda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got all that Olympic mindset,</v>

185
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:19.754
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

186
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.630
<v Speaker 2>It's priceless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

187
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

188
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 2>hello everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're lucky,</v>

189
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.313
<v Speaker 2>wake the whole division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lucky that he had a good wrestling </v>

190
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.513
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a teaching Gig coaching and they got a </v>

191
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 2>good offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people.</v>

192
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.550
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want him to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't let him fight in the UFC.</v>

193
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Was the Brigham Young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what he was with and they</v>

194
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fight in the UFC.</v>

195
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 2>He can't fight cage fighting while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're teaching wrestling,</v>

196
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.013
<v Speaker 2>not byu son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so lucky because of that </v>

197
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:48.824
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker got in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked at every single thing about </v>

198
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Yoel Romero said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen him get taken down.</v>

199
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take a stand up.</v>

200
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.653
<v Speaker 2>Stand up holding me down with Jesus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my side and change the way you hold him </v>

201
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:09.790
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's drug test.</v>

202
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

203
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean this flip scripts there,</v>

204
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:21.264
<v Speaker 2>but how about bisbing Anderson Silva?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was blowing your phone up during that </v>

205
00:09:24.401 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was first of all.</v>

206
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Biz being is one of the toughest man on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

207
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 2>That dude has one eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

208
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 2>One knocked out bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the third round came back,</v>

209
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>won the fourth document.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's blind in one eye.</v>

210
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they don't bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to see something.</v>

211
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Say something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

212
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we were reading the teleprompter</v>

213
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 2>and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>

214
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I is,</v>

215
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I guess at certain angles he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold of.</v>

216
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I certainly because it's kind of tunnel </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>

217
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Oil in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oil In the other.</v>

218
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I have a Zap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

219
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's to protect the retina and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it in place is that they can attach</v>

220
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:05.630
<v Speaker 2>it yet because if they attach it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a rip off again.</v>

221
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They attach it again.</v>

222
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 2>It'll be more damaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he has to wait until he's.</v>

223
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.520
<v Speaker 2>After he's done fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can read it.</v>

224
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.363
<v Speaker 2>So thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be interested in Silva with one I </v>

225
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Nelson's a south pole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucked.</v>

226
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 2>How crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

227
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts man.</v>

228
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.160
<v Speaker 2>That flying to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

229
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

230
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 2>But need that Anderson landed was </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn glorious.</v>

231
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.563
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't he didn't kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jumps up with the front leg or with </v>

232
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:30.234
<v Speaker 2>the right leg and then like there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a pause in the air and then </v>

233
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 2>back lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still had that ability to move,</v>

234
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 2>like just kind of stare at you right </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the cage.</v>

235
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 2>But then it was weird when he was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the cage,</v>

236
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.313
<v Speaker 2>he didn't seem to want to throw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird that you felt like he </v>

237
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>had bisbing like especially the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the fourth round,</v>

238
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 2>he could've capitalized and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitant.</v>

239
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 2>He's 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

240
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 2>He's 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 year old man.</v>

241
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Can't just chalk that up like he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>an older fighter man.</v>

242
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal fighting natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.033
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean bisbing was given them a ton of </v>

244
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 2>shit saying you've been on steroids your</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole career.</v>

245
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.433
<v Speaker 2>Fair assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if that's true or not </v>

246
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:11.460
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just know the one time he was tested,</v>

247
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 2>he got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.231
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

249
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not like outlandish for Yasmin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that.</v>

250
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 2>The one time out of competition testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got caught.</v>

251
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.403
<v Speaker 2>He knew who the fuck knows man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious when you look at his </v>

252
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.710
<v Speaker 2>trainer and he go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purple man guys.</v>

253
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's in his sixties and I'm not.</v>

254
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:34.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he might be like 65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>66 years old or something like that.</v>

255
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Dick Veins have got more muscle than all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us together.</v>

256
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 2>We packed all my muscle together easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a cluster.</v>

257
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cox with fees so big.</v>

258
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 2>He's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's not natural.</v>

259
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he's not natural than Anderson </v>

260
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 2>knows about steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's heard of them.</v>

261
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.253
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy who was teaching him how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift weights and running them through </v>

262
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>his strength</v>

263
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning program is 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

264
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

265
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these years you've been fighting.</v>

266
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:01.954
<v Speaker 3>This is stuff that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not interesting for </v>

267
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 3>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Person.</v>

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Super to super prison.</v>

269
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have your body moves better,</v>

270
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.244
<v Speaker 3>you don't get brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not important that the </v>

271
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 3>testing is super effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

272
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.714
<v Speaker 3>They're doing these guys.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Let's say smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beats conor.</v>

300
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

302
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.930

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 3>it's a Dq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

304
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:32.660
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a little contest if I smoked </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed to fight.</v>

305
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 3>If I smoked weed today.</v>

306
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 3>The fight is in two days or three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

307
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 3>If I smoked weed today and the day of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>

308
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you test me?</v>

309
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.140
<v Speaker 3>I want to find out like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the levels are.</v>

310
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.213
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you literally have to get high </v>

311
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 3>the day before or the day of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the new parameters.</v>

312
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.763
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

313
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

314
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 3>it's way different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way different.</v>

315
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 3>It's way different than it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to.</v>

316
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not like trace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to have trace amounts of thc,</v>

317
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.533
<v Speaker 3>but if I really believe that if I smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed today and I ask them to test me on </v>

318
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be okay.</v>

319
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 3>The day of the fight though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

320

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

325
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.970

328
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 3>They changed it around and was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be five years and they made it like a</v>

329
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 3>year and a half I think is.</v>

330
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 3>they made it.</v>

331
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be an interesting fight.</v>

332
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Only because they fought before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Nick,</v>

00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>

347
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.373
<v Speaker 3>Assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where they did the vandelay banned him </v>

348
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 3>for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's booked.</v>

349
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Ventilator signed with bell door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

350
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 3>But so abilities he did see today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it breaking news and Shit.</v>

351
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that,</v>

352
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.273
<v Speaker 3>but here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked on the last podcast and Bill </v>

353
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Wanderlei Silva eventually has to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>fader or first he's gonna fight fader or</v>

354
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 3>first that's the big fight in Japan or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>

355
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 3>but the having that fight in Japan could</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw his whole beltour deal in jeopardy</v>

356
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 3>because he's going to have to find on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian casinos once he fights,</v>

357
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.273
<v Speaker 3>which at vandelays age is probably not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing in the world anyway </v>

358
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 3>because it's good and juicy.</v>

359
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 3>There's certain guys probably will </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

360
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.143
<v Speaker 3>There's certain guys that only fight in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain places and they look </v>

361
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

362
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly how everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>

363
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 3>but I know for Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that.</v>

364
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's even more shit.</v>

365
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 3>That's even Australia only please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

366
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.203
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is they don't have a Jeff </v>

367
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Levitsky at Bella tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a fucking a hawk.</v>

368
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Nor do they want one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

369
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.230
<v Speaker 3>they don't want one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want the UFC.</v>

370
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to do here?</v>

371
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.563
<v Speaker 3>You fucking move on with our alumni,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're dealing with the commission </v>

372
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 3>to missions easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

373
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.060
<v Speaker 3>enforced this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the commissioner.</v>

374
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 3>This is the UFC is I did like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission.</v>

375
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a famous line that someone made up.</v>

376
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:55.124
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they said that passing one of those </v>

377
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Speaker 3>urine test is an intelligence test.</v>

378
00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not a drug test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

379
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.690
<v Speaker 3>It might've been a Victor Conte might've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been victor contact,</v>

380
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.180
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

381
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.680
<v Speaker 3>who's the bulk Ho guy who if anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking knows,</v>

382
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:08.780
<v Speaker 3>he knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>

383
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:09.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

384
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I think vandelay well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

385
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:11.864
<v Speaker 3>I think they should fucking vandelays </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspension should be exactly as long as </v>

386
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:15.554
<v Speaker 3>it would have been if he got popped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is nine months at the </v>

387
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it,</v>

388
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.330
<v Speaker 3>was it back then when he got caught?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it nine months?</v>

389
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Back then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nine months.</v>

390
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you test positive nine months,</v>

391
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 3>so he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should be done.</v>

392
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:26.414
<v Speaker 3>This suspension should be over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find them a little bit and let's move </v>

393
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

394
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.690

<v Speaker 3>Manderlay positive ones,</v>

395
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.543
<v Speaker 3>Napa,</v>

396
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:38.031
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 3>but Japan didn't have tests or if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>did have tests,</v>

399
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 3>they didn't care.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bigger school that's super and sell it </v>

517
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:25.990
<v Speaker 2>in pill form.</v>

518
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

519
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.870

<v Speaker 2>guys are older.</v>

520
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.733
<v Speaker 2>When steroids hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't think it was as bad as it </v>

521
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:33.550
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

522
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Like a WHO's at Laila as NATO was kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the first one who's like,</v>

523
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:37.444
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to die because I use steroids </v>

524
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 2>before it wasn't a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like cigarettes,</v>

525
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Blind.</v>

526
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zeto I don't think it was because of </v>

527
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think would lozito was doing.</v>

528
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 2>He was doing an early form of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth hormone.</v>

529
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I might be off base here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

530
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.793
<v Speaker 2>Jamie wanted to say though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the early form of human growth </v>

531
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:59.160
<v Speaker 2>hormone was taken from cadavers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't taken.</v>

532
00:23:59.161 --> 00:23:59.994
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't made in a lab with bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they make growth hormone today </v>

533
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 2>in the early form of human growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormone,</v>

534
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.883
<v Speaker 2>you would take it and there was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy adverse side effects like people </v>

535
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:11.714
<v Speaker 2>got really fucked up that you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Jacob Crooks felt you can get </v>

536
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 2>mad cow disease from him from it.</v>

537
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:19.403
<v Speaker 2>You get all kinds of data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was saying that he was dying because of </v>

538
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:23.420
<v Speaker 2>that and then scientists came out or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

539
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 2>no son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he has a brain tumor.</v>

540
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

541
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also got to deal with the massive </v>

542
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:34.210
<v Speaker 2>amount of trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy played football for hard,</v>

543
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.190
<v Speaker 2>hard maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

544
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of bad things happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your brain when you play football for</v>

545
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

546
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.870
<v Speaker 2>especially the way he did football back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then was different.</v>

547
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Who knows why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of why he got brain,</v>

548
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.253
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of other guys that were doing </v>

549
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God brain tumors,</v>

550
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 2>so it could have been completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrelated.</v>

551
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that human growth hormone,</v>

552
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand is so it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to help grow everything.</v>

553
00:24:58.821 --> 00:24:59.654
<v Speaker 2>That's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also if you have a tumor cell to </v>

554
00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 2>help grow that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could.</v>

555
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.060
<v Speaker 2>It's potentially a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is potentially a side effect,</v>

556
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why one of the things they say </v>

557
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 2>that's really important than if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do do that,</v>

558
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:10.544
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get yourself scanned and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it like the way those guys </v>

559
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 2>are doing and where you're taking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 units a day,</v>

560
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've taken mass.</v>

561
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why the bodybuilders show big and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have those,</v>

562
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 2>those power guts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guts.</v>

563
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

564
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it,</v>

565
00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:26.570
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

566
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like these bulging muscles too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing,</v>

567
00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 2>like if you have those gigantic like Lee</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haney,</v>

568
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 2>ab muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think of his whole body.</v>

569
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Everything's giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's trying,</v>

570
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 2>so his ab muscles are giant too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

571
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:43.720
<v Speaker 2>they stick out also because there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>

572
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Oregon to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a greater deck apparently.</v>

573
00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:47.594
<v Speaker 2>No Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do take massive amounts for long </v>

574
00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 2>periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can grow your organs larger,</v>

575
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think what we're looking at and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're looking at those guys,</v>

576
00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is just massive muscle.</v>

577
00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.513
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

621
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.403
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with those guys is what do </v>

622
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:42.190
<v Speaker 2>they do when it's over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed um,</v>

623
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:43.703
<v Speaker 2>some of the guys from the old days that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are still alive today and they get off </v>

624
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:50.680
<v Speaker 2>the sauce and their body just depressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>kidneys are,</v>

625
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't they have to keep doing it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fill the gap in their body.</v>

626
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:56.760

<v Speaker 2>some form of testosterone,</v>

627
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 2>but the kidneys is from the weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutter.</v>

628
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.200

629
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Speaker 2>The kidneys is from the massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydration.</v>

630
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.033
<v Speaker 2>When you see those guys and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing on that scale or not scale on </v>

631

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it might,</v>

653
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 2>it might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a cantaloupe,</v>

654
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 2>but he's doing some case stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like stripping for men.</v>

655
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.470
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay Porn didn't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>why do you say that?</v>

657
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Feel like he knows he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why he shouldn't.</v>

658
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.000
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He puts on the mask,</v>

659
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 2>the mask and posts and subways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's second.</v>

<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

661
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.123
<v Speaker 2>And think one of the reasons why he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't win this because he has this </v>

662
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.330
<v Speaker 2>history of doing some promiscuous stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>with men like this.</v>

663
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of him stripping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shoves the winning.</v>

665
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:35.670

<v Speaker 2>win when it comes in second,</v>

666
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.530

668
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's the offensive part of that.</v>

669
00:29:42.061 --> 00:29:42.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the hair,</v>

<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

673
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Phil Heath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

674
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:50.610
<v Speaker 2>they are both enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

675
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it gets down to this,</v>

676
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 2>like these two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you decide who wins?</v>

677
00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.380
<v Speaker 2>How could you even our semester,</v>

<v Speaker 2>connoisseur.</v>

680
00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's symmetry.</v>

681
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you know a great glass of wine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tannins and the cookie flavor A.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's symmetry.</v>

683
00:30:14.811 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at muscle development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also looking at symmetry.</v>

684
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but these two guys,</v>

686
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 2>they're in different stages of the pose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the guy on the left,</v>

687
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.343
<v Speaker 2>his arms are further apart now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one chose that pose and the other </v>

688
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:32.700
<v Speaker 2>chose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feel he poses right,</v>

689
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.870
<v Speaker 2>but see how kai greene forgot about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

690
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Phil said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

691
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.170

692
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.270

<v Speaker 2>He's perfectly proportional.</v>

694

<v Speaker 2>I hope he is.</v>

752
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he's doing a superfight </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

753
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 2>That whole Eddie Bravo invitation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're going to do the open weight</v>

<v Speaker 2>like anybody can compete the absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be amazing.</v>

00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don.</v>

<v Speaker 2>March.</v>

<v Speaker 2>March 24th and I are doing the play by </v>

760
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 2>play for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really with a Jujitsu Guy?</v>

761
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say hopefully because I'm</v>

762
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.900
<v Speaker 2>going to probably do the Jujitsu play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for sure who you guys.</v>

763
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have some travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's running the thing on it.</v>

764
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.863
<v Speaker 2>Got Them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who the judges would play </v>

765
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:38.691
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

766
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:43.691
<v Speaker 2>I asked him todd white lives in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be him to be fun though.</v>

767
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

768
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu tournament to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think so.</v>

769
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of these platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

770
00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the cool things about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too is that,</v>

771
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely get injured,</v>

772
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:57.140
<v Speaker 2>definitely get broken bones and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not,</v>

773
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't compete it and not worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about head trauma,</v>

774
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:00.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think a lot of people that are </v>

775
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:05.570
<v Speaker 2>interested in martial arts are </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitating towards that because they're</v>

776
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:06.980
<v Speaker 2>realizing now like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

777
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:09.050
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably,</v>

778
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of options if you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn how to fight,</v>

779
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 2>where you're not going to get your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>rattled.</v>

780
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.103
<v Speaker 2>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's such a debate now like in </v>

781
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:17.324
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially about kids playing rugby and </v>

782
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 2>any kind of girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're up in America.</v>

783
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a very real thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors and academics are going.</v>

784
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know it's a great sport,</v>

785
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:29.354
<v Speaker 2>but you are talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are talking about head trauma to </v>

786
00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 2>your 14 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>

787
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Whether what that's gonna do to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>later down the line,</v>

788
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 2>we don't know America is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances are you'll probably be fine when</v>

789
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:40.064
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about someone who's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>young that they don't really understand </v>

790
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>the repercussions of their current </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

791
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 2>And if you're doing something at 14 that</v>
<v Speaker 2>might affect you when you're 44,</v>

792
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

793
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then yet again,</v>

794
00:34:51.921 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot of people that play </v>
<v Speaker 2>football and they're fine at 44.</v>

795
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:57.350
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people play for four years.</v>

796
00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

797
00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Most of those guys are fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just fucked up.</v>

798
00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:05.060
<v Speaker 2>But not if you played in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We played in high school due to a lot of</v>

799
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.840
<v Speaker 2>people that they've tested that are high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

800
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 2>cte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cte.</v>

801
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are finding more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

802
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.823
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure it causes damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is that it's not as </v>

803
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 2>though I don't think the epidemic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that play football.</v>

804
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Like if you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

805
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>most people would played football even </v>
<v Speaker 2>in high school,</v>

806
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have brain damage.</v>

807
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I bet they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compared to people who didn't.</v>

808
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that.</v>

809
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.823
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's things like you can be high </v>

810
00:35:29.271 --> 00:35:30.104
<v Speaker 2>functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also have like real impulse </v>

811
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>problems and a lot of those real impulse</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems are created by head trauma,</v>

812
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:36.610
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

813
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Here's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will lash out anger issues.</v>

814
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.783
<v Speaker 2>A matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Oj Simpson's </v>

815
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:42.744
<v Speaker 2>doctor said that if they were doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>same trial today when he was tried for </v>

816
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.490
<v Speaker 2>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would probably bring up.</v>

817
00:35:48.491 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see?</v>

818
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the question.</v>

819
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 2>When you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to ban and it's just,</v>

820
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.233
<v Speaker 2>it's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going to band combat </v>

821
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 2>sports for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

822
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:58.824
<v Speaker 2>you wonder like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a lot of benefit from sports </v>

823
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:02.850
<v Speaker 2>that are rough as well in a way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

824
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.123
<v Speaker 2>in how it builds character or it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sport you might be built for and </v>

825
00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:08.930
<v Speaker 2>you're really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>

826
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 2>if you're built like a Samoan and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer isn't going to be as good for you</v>

827
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:14.694
<v Speaker 2>as football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a way you've got to be careful </v>

828
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:16.810
<v Speaker 2>with this stuff.</v>

829
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.990
<v Speaker 2>You need some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

830
00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely good to toughen people </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

831
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.970
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no,</v>

832
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.833
<v Speaker 2>no better avenue to teach people </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline and how to be tough than </v>

833
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:30.550
<v Speaker 2>combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think combat sports is,</v>

834
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the one thing where you have to </v>

835
00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:35.850
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to actually get it done.</v>

836
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no maybes.</v>

837
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

838
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 2>You get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's helping you.</v>

839
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 2>No one's helping you by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

840
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 2>You enter into that ring is a referee in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

841
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Guys just saved your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

842
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another dude and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>weighs the same as,</v>

843
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:53.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like taekwondo,</v>

844
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you guys get knocked down and kicked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

845
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 2>but you get a lot out of getting better </v>
<v Speaker 2>at something,</v>

846
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when the stakes are high.</v>

847
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:02.623
<v Speaker 2>You certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that if I had to do it all </v>

848
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:05.754
<v Speaker 2>over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I knew what I know now and I </v>

849
00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:10.350
<v Speaker 2>went back and it was involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking sports,</v>

850
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd be way more careful.</v>

851
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.863
<v Speaker 2>Way More careful about head kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know I kinda got lucky and dodged a lot </v>

852
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:19.140
<v Speaker 2>of trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know a lot of people who didn't.</v>

853
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of a lot of kickboxers who just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought for nothing.</v>

854
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.863
<v Speaker 2>I enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I thought it was cool when </v>

855
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.323
<v Speaker 2>they'd go 30 seconds left in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym would turn and watch me and Shannon </v>

856
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.033
<v Speaker 2>Cohen plant our feet and just slug each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other in the head and we get done like </v>

857
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:34.650
<v Speaker 2>high five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting my cons.</v>

858
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Throw up chase and Shane would call me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

859
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.913
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot where I was going and at the </v>

860
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 2>time were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gods you tomorrow.</v>

861
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 2>See You tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meet head power.</v>

862
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Then we get in our cars and do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next day.</v>

863
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.573
<v Speaker 2>I remember playing football in college </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a play called 96 power and </v>

864
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.010
<v Speaker 2>then you'll bring in the shop bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the shop.</v>

865
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.053
<v Speaker 2>I'd come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was me versus giant linebacker named </v>

866
00:37:56.371 --> 00:37:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Brian [inaudible] who was a second round</v>
<v Speaker 2>or third round draft.</v>

867
00:37:58.471 --> 00:37:59.304
<v Speaker 2>Pick a nightmare and I take a running </v>
<v Speaker 2>start and we'd run into each other and </v>

868
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:06.560
<v Speaker 2>everyone wait and stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my thing and I think of it not,</v>

869
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the front guy.</v>

870
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 2>If it's the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy in the front of the idiot.</v>

871
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sounds simone and simone.</v>

872
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black is nine from Houston,</v>

873
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close though,</v>

874
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.423
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you rethink things you've done </v>

875
00:38:24.091 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 2>obviously in your past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at earlier parts of my career,</v>

876
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.090
<v Speaker 2>all of my training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a good chin.</v>

877
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Granted I fight child size grownups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the the lollipop guild</v>

878
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.160
<v Speaker 4>attacking you is another big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you will learn.</v>

879
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 4>You fucking like Linux or Linux.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hit me.</v>

880
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:50.690
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking hard and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything in the ring going Funky,</v>

881
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 4>like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't attack me right now.</v>

882
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:56.530
<v Speaker 4>That hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been hit a lot.</v>

883
00:38:56.531 --> 00:38:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I put myself in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hospital snowboarding,</v>

884
00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.990
<v Speaker 4>hitting my head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

885
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely had some brain that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't trade it though.</v>

886
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:03.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't trade it for the one that I </v>

887
00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 4>would train different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

888
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You guys are both okay right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not Muhammad Ali,</v>

889
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Joe Frazier in his the later years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by the time you get old,</v>

890
00:39:16.531 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some shit worked out,</v>

891
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 2>they're going to stick a fucking syringe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your brain scored some stem cells in</v>

892
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 2>there and you're going to be good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty sure.</v>

893
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting real close.</v>

894
00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're getting real close to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reengineering the entire human frame.</v>

895
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.680
<v Speaker 2>They're getting so close to every day </v>
<v Speaker 2>that moved one step closer,</v>

896
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:33.514
<v Speaker 2>but then 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years they're gonna have some cures </v>

897
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:36.574
<v Speaker 2>for all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you're already like </v>

898
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:40.810
<v Speaker 2>at Muhammad Ali's stage or Freddie </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roach,</v>

899
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.030
<v Speaker 2>game over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

900
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Freddie Roach has functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson's.</v>

901
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 2>That's from trauma and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

902
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.710
<v Speaker 2>he's open about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in war.</v>

903
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 2>You watch this old fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he stops fight sooner now.</v>

904
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's smart about it because he goes,</v>

905
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I wish my coach would have stopped the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight sooner.</v>

906
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.600
<v Speaker 2>So now what was his last flight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was cody's like,</v>

907
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got one more ram.</v>

908
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

909
00:40:01.091 --> 00:40:03.190
<v Speaker 2>the guy who fought Cova love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his face?</v>

910
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.053
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

911
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

912
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Canadian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pascal,</v>

913
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.063
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean,</v>

914
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 2>John Pascoe who was just getting box was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing nothing.</v>

915
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was getting the therapy and go,</v>

916
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the first fight took a shitload </v>

917
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:19.923
<v Speaker 2>out of him and that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do not want to admit when you </v>

918
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 2>take the kind of beating that he took in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first fight in the first fight,</v>

919
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.270
<v Speaker 2>arguably was called a hair soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

920
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.593
<v Speaker 2>but it's a hair mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His argument was that it was called two </v>

921
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:33.904
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a great chance he should have been </v>

922
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 2>able to fight.</v>

923
00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 2>He tagged him a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could have won that fight.</v>

924
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.430
<v Speaker 2>He did tag them a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't tag him a few times.</v>

925
00:40:40.431 --> 00:40:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And that second find that second five </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the coal Kovalev show.</v>

926
00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up asked weapon.</v>

927
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking scary murder to murder.</v>

928
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.450
<v Speaker 2>He's in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fluid and you know what he likes to</v>

929
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:55.620
<v Speaker 2>do for a strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>palladium movement.</v>

930
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Coach milady's does a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the hot ass in there.</v>

931
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.560
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in his wife,</v>

932
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 2>the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at his body,</v>

933
00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he hits that heart is </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect technique,</v>

934
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:10.770
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long limbs and doing it for everybody.</v>

935
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.633
<v Speaker 2>It's like the body is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the skeleton is the big skeleton is </v>

936
00:41:15.461 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 2>a giant part of how a guy can punch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of the hands,</v>

937
00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:20.320
<v Speaker 2>the shape of the shoulders.</v>

938
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge factor.</v>

939
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.300
<v Speaker 2>What makes connor so good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at KCI shoulders.</v>

940
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.790
<v Speaker 2>His shoulders or dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge man.</v>

941
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I think he weighed at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>71 78 right now he's,</v>

942
00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's that this week to make 70.</v>

943
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 2>How about chocolate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate.</v>

944
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Dell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to get us.</v>

945
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 2>He'd get measured and he'd hold his </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders in.</v>

946
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:41.804
<v Speaker 2>So it said he was 76 inches when he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really 79 and he was standing next to </v>

947
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:48.380
<v Speaker 2>you and I was looking at what they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because he wanted.</v>

948
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.310
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want you to know how long has </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached out to Dick.</v>

949
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

950
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.470
<v Speaker 2>We'll tell them to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

951
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:56.403
<v Speaker 2>so that it says it reached 76 and if all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden it comes out with 79 inches </v>

952
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 2>and he's jabbing you or whatever he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

953
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at him and,</v>

954
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:03.763
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how wide his shoulders were and how big </v>

955
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 2>he's walking around at 2:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

956
00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.670
<v Speaker 2>He's been talking crazy shit about Jon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones.</v>

958
00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:11.504
<v Speaker 2>Just wait until he slaps you John's or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chuck's big hands reaching the Gaza </v>

959
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.460
<v Speaker 2>table lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

960
00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:16.323
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

961
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 2>he thinks he would give Jon Jones </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble right now.</v>

962
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 2>He's a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll do it.</v>

963
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just that idea of fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this thing in his head.</v>

964
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still hits the bag and you know,</v>

965
00:42:28.641 --> 00:42:30.490
<v Speaker 2>he still has power and he still thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if he.</v>

966
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I think his exact words were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I hit him right now,</v>

967
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.660
<v Speaker 2>if I put my hands on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd give him trouble.</v>

968
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.540
<v Speaker 2>He said his style would give John Fritz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

969
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 2>And he said that John wouldn't be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to out wrestle him,</v>

970
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:44.600
<v Speaker 2>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>

971
00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>ass wars and it's over.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

976
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.630
<v Speaker 2>He's earned the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

978
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:01.724

<v Speaker 2>but either way employed John responded </v>

979
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:07.490

<v Speaker 2>What's your weight back and forth to </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and love it.</v>

993
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys think of a home tape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good fight.</v>

994
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a different fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm,</v>

995
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is she's first of all,</v>

996
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.823
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best striker in that fucking </v>

997
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:54.974
<v Speaker 2>division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one moves like her knew her </v>

998
00:43:56.811 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 2>athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her footwork or kicks in,</v>

999
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:01.004
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way she's conservative with that </v>

1000
00:44:02.241 --> 00:44:03.074
<v Speaker 2>head kick to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She waits till she knows it's time and </v>

1001
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:07.020
<v Speaker 2>then Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't waste time on it.</v>

1002
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I can just throw it into the calculator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lands it.</v>

1003
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking step to neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh so,</v>

1004
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at our highlight reel,</v>

1005
00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:20.230
<v Speaker 2>it's all that in other smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations with UFC.</v>

1006
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.290
<v Speaker 2>But misha tate fights with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressures.</v>

1007
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Toughest Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her grappling is really good.</v>

1008
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Super Gritty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's reading,</v>

1009
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:32.510
<v Speaker 2>she's got singles and doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just close the door she's got.</v>

1010
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 2>But here's one thing she has to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1011
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>she can't run in like what Rhonda did is</v>
<v Speaker 2>play right into the strengths of holly.</v>

1012
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Holly's a fantastic counter striker and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda just wanted to overwhelm her with</v>

1013
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:44.154
<v Speaker 2>pressure and power and take her out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she got cracked early and often and </v>

1014
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:49.014
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the first round she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like seeing tweety birds and all kinds </v>

1015
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:52.944
<v Speaker 2>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably had no idea what the fuck </v>

1016
00:44:53.551 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 2>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

1017
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:56.770
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to fight like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is not,</v>

1018
00:44:56.771 --> 00:44:57.604
<v Speaker 2>she can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to fight hands up high and </v>

1019
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:00.024
<v Speaker 2>she's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's gonna fight more conservative and </v>

1020
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I keep going into the Raquel Pennington </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight,</v>

1021
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:05.574
<v Speaker 2>which was holly's first fight in UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she won a very close split </v>

1022
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:11.970
<v Speaker 2>decision and it's not taking anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from Raquel because Raquel is a bad</v>

1023
00:45:11.971 --> 00:45:12.804
<v Speaker 2>ass bitch.</v>

1024
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.410
<v Speaker 2>All due respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To recap,</v>

1025
00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you'll see jitter son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1026
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.023
<v Speaker 2>UFC jitters are a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably played a big </v>

1027
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:21.474
<v Speaker 2>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also raquel's just real tough and </v>

1028
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:25.380
<v Speaker 2>real smart and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't rush in.</v>

1029
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.273
<v Speaker 2>I think the rushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact there was a big part of that </v>

1030
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronda just charging straightforward like</v>

1031
00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 2>fucking wild animal and then holly </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving and craft the worst.</v>

1032
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 2>And what do you do with a technician?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1033
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.863
<v Speaker 2>You make it a fricking gritty fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what mister blancher and I don't </v>

1034
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:44.274
<v Speaker 2>know if she's gonna win that clench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to get for her to shoot </v>

1035
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:50.100
<v Speaker 2>a double or a single from that distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get sprawled on.</v>

1036
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>You can training be a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's taken holly down.</v>

1037
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.920
<v Speaker 2>You have no one's taken it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can get.</v>

1038
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 2>You look at the previous three fights in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC.</v>

1039
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:58.643
<v Speaker 2>People can get her to the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then then you got an a clench and I </v>

1040
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 2>think holly is stronger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha,</v>

1041
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's going to take over her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1042
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about the wrestling aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>

1043
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean she hits harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my friend Justin,</v>

1044
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Justin Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suzanne Brown belt,</v>

1045
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>division one wrestler,</v>

1046
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>serious fucking athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that holly feels like a dude.</v>

1047
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.653
<v Speaker 2>He said he rolled with both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You both enrolled with holly and with </v>

1048
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no comparison.</v>

1049
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like holly as strong as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See it?</v>

1050
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:26.970
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's really strong.</v>

1051
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I think holly winds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's a different fight.</v>

1052
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a tougher fight for holly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The different puzzle to figure it out.</v>

1053
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.200
<v Speaker 2>It's all about match ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.043
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that she gets destroyed </v>

1055
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:35.994
<v Speaker 2>like Rhonda did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she gets out class like </v>

1056
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda did.</v>

1057
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a closer fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but holly still comes out on top.</v>

1058
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1059
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is that holly went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through camp for Rhonda,</v>

1060
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 2>like no camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chevron went through before and she said</v>

1061
00:46:46.021 --> 00:46:48.300
<v Speaker 2>she trained so fucking hard for that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the results of that.</v>

1062
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I think she's going to do the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for this camp.</v>

1063
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.043
<v Speaker 2>So if she goes into this fight with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>same kind of training camp behind her </v>

1064
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's just in fucking phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

1065
00:46:58.171 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Like she was for Ronda Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she is.</v>

1066
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.493
<v Speaker 2>She might box that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more pressure on holly now </v>

1067
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.620
<v Speaker 2>because we exchanged there to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1068
00:47:05.621 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 2>she's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a one time thing.</v>

1069
00:47:07.501 --> 00:47:10.740
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't a one trick pony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to just a flash in the pan.</v>

1070
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I think for her there's more pressure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform now.</v>

1071
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was such a big underdog.</v>

1072
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:15.560
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1073
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't getting mercked beats the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck out of it.</v>

1074
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:18.534
<v Speaker 2>Now we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn polly's for reals now there's </v>

1075
00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:21.230
<v Speaker 2>pressure on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1076
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's happy.</v>

1077
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.620
<v Speaker 2>She's in 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Type this my man.</v>

1078
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 2>What about women's boxing lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When's the thing we watched it exactly.</v>

1079
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 2>It's in the high school auditorium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A big deal for her though.</v>

1080
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:32.164
<v Speaker 2>She's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not saying that you're not doing press </v>

1081
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.250
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not the champion.</v>

1082
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 2>You don't have everyone ready how he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready for this,</v>

1083
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but another thing is taking pressure off</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that most people are paying attention</v>

1084
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 2>to connor for this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this fight.</v>

1085
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 2>They're talking to her a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Percent is the condom mcgregor show.</v>

1086
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you guys this question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the car,</v>

1087
00:47:47.821 --> 00:47:51.510
<v Speaker 2>but this is a weird question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good fights will pull up the car at this</v>

1088
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 2>good fights is a great card.</v>

1089
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.480
<v Speaker 2>He's not just a good car for those car </v>
<v Speaker 2>show though.</v>

1090
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the connor show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's pull up this car.</v>

1091
00:47:57.491 --> 00:47:58.324
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking bunch of good fights </v>

1092
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 2>on this car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1093
00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 2>here's one that everyone's sleeping on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez.</v>

1094
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>That is the dark horse as the division </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

1095
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez is a fucking knockout </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

1096
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 2>She is tough as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1097
00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Stretching she's taken on is Valentina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a chick who was tough as fuck too,</v>

1098
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 2>and a multiple time world Moitai fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1099
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Let's calm down on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A posture though,</v>

1100
00:48:23.051 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Hon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Valentino.</v>

1101
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's Russian Bros.</v>

1102
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.360
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've goT a fucking dumb shit.</v>

1103
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curgas.</v>

1104
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:31.303
<v Speaker 2>Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as I mentioned he has is so </v>

1105
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 2>athletic and her striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's bad ass.</v>

1106
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.740
<v Speaker 2>She's a bucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fit.</v>

1107
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.570
<v Speaker 2>She hits fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched that.</v>

1108
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Sara mcmann fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got a listing of a right hand.</v>

1109
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.410
<v Speaker 2>She might be the biggest one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punch striker in that division.</v>

1110
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>She's tough as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but You know,</v>

1111
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 2>you look at her and then you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire division.</v>

1112
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:55.324
<v Speaker 2>I think it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fight is a big fight for her </v>

1113
00:48:57.191 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 2>because valentina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she also went through her ufc jitters.</v>

1114
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.623
<v Speaker 2>She was like real stiff and awkward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was telling herself that in between </v>

1115
00:49:05.291 --> 00:49:06.124
<v Speaker 2>rounds in her first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's going to be like </v>

1116
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming into this fight.</v>

1117
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Good striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

1118
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another fighter,</v>

1119
00:49:11.791 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 2>but he's sleeping on your boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brandon thatch and bought her designer.</v>

1120
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a good loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History papers you think so?</v>

1121
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't give either one of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are walking papers.</v>

1122
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You're not joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both exciting to watch.</v>

1123
00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are great fighters.</v>

1124
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A car by her disease.</v>

1125
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he hasn't been almost two years time </v>

1126
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:34.300
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1127
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.860
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to them?</v>

1128
00:49:35.861 --> 00:49:36.694
<v Speaker 2>Do you not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he got hurt and then thatches </v>

1129
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.210
<v Speaker 2>lost two in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're too short notice.</v>

1130
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Fights get a change in gunner nelson and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to fight ben henderson.</v>

1131
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 2>YEah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he got clipped and the nelson fight</v>

1132
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 2>gunner surprised him with that left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hook.</v>

1133
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That was a big punch and then submitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1134
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 2>That was a big fight though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1135
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people could see him in the gym,</v>

1136
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.141
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1137
00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:58.710
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is he too big here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's incredibly.</v>

1138
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.553
<v Speaker 2>He's not too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always been a discipline issue for </v>

1139
00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:06.220
<v Speaker 2>him and it's always been izzy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight because nico see you can't man.</v>

1140
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.080
<v Speaker 2>You just can't have a night off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat.</v>

1141
00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:08.914
<v Speaker 2>Gunnar nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't not be focused and being a </v>

1142
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.620
<v Speaker 2>striking range of a top 10 or top 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.483
<v Speaker 2>guy and not get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in losing all that weight to get </v>

1144
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:19.780
<v Speaker 2>down to one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he walk around at?</v>

1145
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 2>He's a one 90.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it?</v>

1146
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's but shredded.</v>

1147
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>He looks so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No shredding.</v>

1148
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.500
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's a light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's tall,</v>

1149
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but he's thin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a lot of muscle.</v>

1150
00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

1151
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I look at him and he looks to me almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a light heavyweight.</v>

1152
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 2>One 85 I'm telling is not a light </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight.</v>

1153
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:37.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

1154
00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously he's fighting at one 70.</v>

1155
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Makes it weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1156
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:41.504
<v Speaker 2>but you never seen a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does seem so relaxed before the </v>

1157
00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:45.284
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it might be with the way he deals </v>

1158
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:46.874
<v Speaker 2>with nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's almost like talking to people </v>

1159
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 2>and he looks way more casual than most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>

1160
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that.</v>

1165
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:12.620

<v Speaker 2>is a great way to get that done.</v>

1307
00:57:44.921 --> 00:57:46.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that shit was real.</v>

1313
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.753
<v Speaker 1>When magic johnson got aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started crying and my mom had to </v>

<v Speaker 1>and guys like that don't just represent </v>

1315
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 1>a conor mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just represent himself.</v>

1316
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Conor mcgregor represents a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1317
00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:11.290
<v Speaker 1>One is possibility like self belief and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>

1318
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.124
<v Speaker 1>the gall to say that I'm going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion coming out of nowhere and do </v>

1319
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:15.904
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also like you have to look at where </v>

1320
00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:18.084
<v Speaker 1>he like Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a really interesting thing </v>

1321
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:20.674
<v Speaker 1>about this during the financial crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LIke what the greeks and people taking </v>

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 1>The irish are quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffers.</v>

1324
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 1>The irish are very stoic people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't show off.</v>

1325
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:36.550
<v Speaker 1>they don't make a big deal about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own issues and pain.</v>

1326
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 1>IT's very an irish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a guy like conor mcgregor all of</v>

<v Speaker 1>shit end of the stick for a lot of their</v>

1328
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:43.954
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you get a guy like conor </v>

1329
00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:46.810
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor to come along and go,</v>

1336
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:05.120
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably gonna get shipped for this.</v>

1337

01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:38.631
<v Speaker 3>this is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1377
01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:39.464
<v Speaker 3>This guy is on the undercard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on the undercard loud and they're </v>

1378
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:42.853
<v Speaker 3>going fucking crazy and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because also boston is a giant irish </v>

1379
01:00:46.191 --> 01:00:47.024
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1380
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.130
<v Speaker 3>But there was just something about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1381
01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is nuts.</v>

1382
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Like the momentum had already started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like way more than anybody I'd ever seen</v>

1383
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:55.784
<v Speaker 3>fighting on the undercard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But another thing that's going on with </v>

1384
01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.054
<v Speaker 3>connor is that everybody knows the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stakes are much higher because of the </v>

1385
01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 3>shit talking.</v>

1386
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.813
<v Speaker 3>He does see all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking is fantastic when you pull it </v>

1387
01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:08.864
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows that if he doesn't </v>

1388
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:13.250
<v Speaker 3>pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if nate fucking sleeps him.</v>

1389
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.293
<v Speaker 3>If nate connects with a straight left </v>
<v Speaker 3>right hook and we see the fucking </v>

1390
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:19.930
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1391
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.110
<v Speaker 3>but you better stay offline for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of weeks.</v>

1392
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1393
01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to,</v>

1394
01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 3>aren't close anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't talk to her,</v>

1395
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't imagine which is what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw when I was online.</v>

1396
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.853
<v Speaker 3>the barrage of hate got hate for rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for telling people she was great for </v>

1397
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 3>expressing my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uh,</v>

1398
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.600
<v Speaker 3>being impressed with her performance is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of hate.</v>

1399
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:54.280
<v Speaker 3>She got different wave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a fucking.</v>

1400
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:58.200
<v Speaker 3>But it might be different though because</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhonda was such a,</v>

1401
01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.660
<v Speaker 3>she was not a very gracious winner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.513
<v Speaker 3>if you look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is climbing rocks and that </v>

1403
01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 3>competition in the ultimate fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's given me the finger.</v>

1404
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:06.703
<v Speaker 3>It was so aggressive and then did not </v>
<v Speaker 3>shake her hand and then to say what she </v>

1405
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:10.754
<v Speaker 3>said about holly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about being a fake ass preacher's </v>

1406
01:02:12.951 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 3>daughter and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of stuff wasn't windy.</v>

1407
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a lot of venom.</v>

1408
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It's very hurtful</v>

1409
01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.273
<v Speaker 2>because then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're being a bully or being </v>

1410
01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 2>exonerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bull exists.</v>

1412
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.790
<v Speaker 2>people know that when she was doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with holly,</v>

1413
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:30.600
<v Speaker 2>there was a fear and she was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put that fear in the holly and the worst</v>

1414
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world is holly just </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing out there,</v>

1415

1587
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:14.774
<v Speaker 2>What racist is is claiming or or </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending that one race is superior to </v>

1588
01:10:19.521 --> 01:10:20.354

<v Speaker 2>but I have never heard that.</v>

1604
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I heard you say anything off color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not once.</v>

1605
01:11:11.621 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I never heard you say a prejudice thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any way and I remember</v>

1606
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.963
<v Speaker 3>saying to you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've never heard you make an off color </v>

1608
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>joke about any race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people,</v>

1609
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:20.583
<v Speaker 3>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you said it never made any sense to </v>

1610
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>

1612
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I can show you a whole lot of really </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb white people.</v>

1613
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 3>I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about socialization.</v>

1614
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just made.</v>

1615
01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 3>It just makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never made sense.</v>

1616
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 3>It's cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets obvious though with data.</v>

1617
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>If data was white and you went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1618
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 3>fucking fried chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pepsi drinking,</v>

1619
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.870
<v Speaker 3>no one's gonna say shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

1620
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:47.440
<v Speaker 3>This is how I feel about the data thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I do feel bad about is that the guy</v>

1621
01:11:47.441 --> 01:11:48.970
<v Speaker 3>is still in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sucks.</v>

1622
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Don't want anything bad to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1623
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anything bad to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1624
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:52.854
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad he's okay and genuinely all we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing was Joking around and having </v>

1625
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 3>fun because that's what we do and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people construe that as racism,</v>

1626
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:02.550
<v Speaker 3>because I mentioned chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please substituted for pizza.</v>

1627
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My intent is what's important.</v>

1628
01:12:05.551 --> 01:12:07.770
<v Speaker 3>People like you were trying to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but same fried chicken.</v>

1629
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

1630
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that's racist.</v>

1631
01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1632
01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's food.</v>

1633
01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:15.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's funny that whole situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1634
01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1635
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 3>you know how when you do some crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people we'll put.</v>

1636
01:12:18.181 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Did you die?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would,</v>

1637
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hitch data dive.</v>

1638
01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Donna died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he was his heart stopped.</v>

1639
01:12:23.821 --> 01:12:24.654
<v Speaker 3>Is that what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man in everyone's saying,</v>

1641
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:28.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we shouldn't have been making fun </v>

1642
01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:30.084
<v Speaker 3>of his weight and his family was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was only two or three pounds </v>

1643
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:33.834
<v Speaker 3>over the week of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then there's even less excuses </v>

1644
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:41.310
<v Speaker 3>because if you're that much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're only two or three pounds,</v>

1645
01:12:41.311 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 3>you're only cutting two or three pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just unprepared.</v>

1646
01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.113
<v Speaker 3>So whoever did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were upset at us that we were </v>

1647
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 3>making fun of his mma training or </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning coach.</v>

1648
01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 3>But this is based on perFormance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to.</v>

1649
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.400
<v Speaker 3>This is a coal main event and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something bigger at stake.</v>

1650
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Like all due respect to data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my feelings on the data thing.</v>

1651
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:04.463
<v Speaker 3>Here's the good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a compliment that I will give </v>

1652
01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that god never quit.</v>

1653
01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:10.410
<v Speaker 3>His fucking heart had to give out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy never quit.</v>

1654
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:11.443
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he still fought three fucking hard </v>

1655
01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:17.310
<v Speaker 3>rounds and he had nothing in the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he never quit.</v>

1656
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Is a loT of opportunities for him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay down.</v>

1657
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 3>He never quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He showed a lot of heart.</v>

1658
01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.900
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't like the way you think joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't trained properly.</v>

1659
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:27.320
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't prepared properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have the skillset.</v>

1660
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1661
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.020
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you walk into that magnitude of a</v>

1662
01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:34.360
<v Speaker 3>fight and he have titties hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make a comment.</v>

1663
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.150
<v Speaker 3>I make a comment like that about Roy Roy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nelson to all the time you get to do.</v>

1664
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:38.993
<v Speaker 3>What about Roy Nelson all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've always said that roy nelson's </v>

1665
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:43.910
<v Speaker 3>gut is like he's wearing like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweaters and that it's just,</v>

1666
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.360
<v Speaker 3>it's all like you're hitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburgers.</v>

1667
01:13:45.361 --> 01:13:47.550
<v Speaker 3>You not even hitting him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hitting all this shit.</v>

1668
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1669
01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 3>that's okay because I'm white and roy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

1670
01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:51.954
<v Speaker 3>but the those fights are not good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the support and this is why they're not </v>

1671
01:13:56.701 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 3>good for the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're takIng two guys that look bad.</v>

1672
01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Their endurance and conditioning was </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible that this.</v>

1673
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:05.603
<v Speaker 3>The scrambles were awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when one time kimbo took him down </v>

1674
01:14:08.971 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 3>And just got on top of them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just laying on the amateur.</v>

1675
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:16.750
<v Speaker 3>It's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bush leagues that there's no way</v>

<v Speaker 3>to the sport and this is not a mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>against them as human beings.</v>

1691
01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.220
<v Speaker 3>This is just where they are now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>whatever you all,</v>

1694
01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:11.040
<v Speaker 3>we all start out as someone who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know anything.</v>

1695
01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:11.993
<v Speaker 3>We all start out with whatever strength </v>
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning you've gotten coming </v>

1699
01:15:20.731 --> 01:15:23.580
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get to a co main event,</v>

<v Speaker 3>supposed to be fighting kimbo and I went</v>

1715
01:16:00.121 --> 01:16:02.180
<v Speaker 3>backstage and I saw seth petrosian.</v>

1716
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1717
01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.150
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ken shamrock got injured.</v>

1718
01:16:05.151 --> 01:16:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

1719
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.083
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seth petrocelli stepped in the day of </v>

1720
01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:10.860
<v Speaker 3>the fight and took the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1721
01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:13.590
<v Speaker 3>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kimball's going against the fucked up.</v>

1722
01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never make calls like that,</v>

1723
01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.330
<v Speaker 3>but I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on video.</v>

1724
01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:21.150
<v Speaker 3>You could watch the video of me saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get fucked up.</v>

1725
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.120
<v Speaker 3>And then he gets knocked out while we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching the video.</v>

1726
01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Like six seconds later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1727
01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:26.363
<v Speaker 3>I told you because there's a difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between fighting guys who were awkward </v>

1728
01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:33.654
<v Speaker 3>and clumsy and you're a big tough guy </v>

1736
01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.920
<v Speaker 5>There's a last minute replacement sap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is always going to fuck them up if</v>

1737
01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:03.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm wrong and never see this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>through this is this is reality.</v>

1745
01:17:47.131 --> 01:17:49.950
<v Speaker 3>There's levels to fighting and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I mean.</v>

1746
01:17:49.951 --> 01:17:51.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an mma analyst,</v>

1747
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:52.603
<v Speaker 3>is what do I do as a profession?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it for a long fucking </v>

1748
01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:57.360
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've called thousands of fights.</v>

1749
01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.500
<v Speaker 3>That fight should not be a co main event</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1750
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying those guys shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to compete against each other.</v>

1751
01:18:04.051 --> 01:18:06.180
<v Speaker 3>They certainly should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

1752
01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:07.043
<v Speaker 3>I mean I understand they want to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid and I get all that and I know the </v>

1753
01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:10.644
<v Speaker 3>kimball has some serious knee problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I kimbo when he was on the ultimate </v>

1754
01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:15.540
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they diagnosed him with bone on bone.</v>

1755
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cartilage is just devastated.</v>

1756
01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:19.203
<v Speaker 3>his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his needs are fucked from years of </v>

1757
01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 3>football and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the mma training that he has done.</v>

1758
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.193
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not hating on those guys to get </v>

<v Speaker 3>A real chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beltour has a real chance of being a </v>

1763
01:18:37.681 --> 01:18:41.340
<v Speaker 3>gigantic organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just signed benson henderson.</v>

<v Speaker 3>up there with the ufc there a fucking </v>

1768
01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:54.864
<v Speaker 3>viacom entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a tremendous amount of money </v>

1769
01:18:56.821 --> 01:18:58.260
<v Speaker 3>behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're oN television.</v>

1770
01:18:58.261 --> 01:19:00.180
<v Speaker 3>They're on spike tv to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1771
01:19:00.181 --> 01:19:01.014
<v Speaker 3>You know what's tough though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to look at the rating </v>

1772
01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:05.500
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 2 million views.</v>

1773
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Toys.is</v>
<v Speaker 3>titties or to the side and kimbro's gas.</v>

1774
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:09.840
<v Speaker 3>It's hoists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gracie though.</v>

1775
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:10.703
<v Speaker 3>That's what quite see.</v>

1776
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kimbo was a huge draw.</v>

1777
01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.810
<v Speaker 3>What is your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if they didn't get toys?</v>

1778
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.673
<v Speaker 3>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if they have the numbers in the </v>

1779
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.740
<v Speaker 3>fight pass for ufc pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight pass.</v>

1780
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Put the freak shows on fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1781
01:19:21.541 --> 01:19:24.870
<v Speaker 3>But why put kim on bypass when you get 2</v>
<v Speaker 3>million views on spike tv?</v>

1782
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.013
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'll drive viewers to your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your content in sucH bad shape that the </v>

1783
01:19:31.531 --> 01:19:36.531
<v Speaker 3>fight itself almost kills him and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>

1784
01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Just just competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost kills them.</v>

1785
01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at the damage that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he took,</v>

1786
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.590
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost nothing.</v>

1787
01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:44.543
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the combination that dropped him like </v>

1788
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.590
<v Speaker 3>the people have played it back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ghost punches his body failed.</v>

1789
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:52.260
<v Speaker 3>If you ate the same shots [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>did against anderson silva.</v>

1790
01:19:52.261 --> 01:19:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh mY god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>

1791
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking flying knee,</v>

1792
01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:58.590
<v Speaker 3>that fucking flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here again,</v>

1793
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:02.550
<v Speaker 3>if anybody felt that I said something </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

1794
01:20:02.970 --> 01:20:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry that you felt that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am.</v>

1795
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sorry that I said chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think this is ridiculous.</v>

1796
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.733
<v Speaker 3>It's a ridiculous argument and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this day and age there's nothing </v>

1797
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:16.500
<v Speaker 3>wrong with chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is nothing wrong with eating chicken.</v>

1798
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 3>It tastes great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not racism.</v>

1799
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.333
<v Speaker 3>Racism is trying to imply that one race </v>
<v Speaker 3>is inferior and that is just not </v>

1800
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.110
<v Speaker 3>replaced chicken with any fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fatty food.</v>

1801
01:20:28.111 --> 01:20:30.030
<v Speaker 3>When you're out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an example,</v>

1802
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.860
<v Speaker 3>but there's a thing that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1803
01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:32.694
<v Speaker 3>what they just looked to be offended or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they decide that this is somethiNg they </v>

1804
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:38.250
<v Speaker 3>should be offended at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not looking at intent.</v>

1805
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:39.323
<v Speaker 3>My intent was I'm talking about a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who obviously he didn't eat kale salads </v>

1806
01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:46.700
<v Speaker 3>and Fucking lean fish to Get to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight man.</v>

1807
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another point is that when you.</v>

1808
01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:54.460
<v Speaker 1>When you say it feels like we live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when,</v>

1809
01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:55.563
<v Speaker 1>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you are fighting for one group of </v>

1810
01:20:57.551 --> 01:20:58.384
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say people who have been oppressed </v>

1811
01:21:00.191 --> 01:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of kind of having an intelligent</v>

1812
01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:06.700
<v Speaker 1>debate and pointing your guns where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be pointed out,</v>

1813
01:21:06.701 --> 01:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>which is usually a complex set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

1814
01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:09.843
<v Speaker 1>What we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like as we're demonizing one </v>

1815
01:21:11.591 --> 01:21:15.040
<v Speaker 1>group to bolster another group that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>call not really.</v>

1816
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:15.874
<v Speaker 1>They're not demonizing white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's demonizing you </v>

1817
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:21.120
<v Speaker 1>think people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1818
01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1819
01:21:22.571 --> 01:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1820
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.443
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to u penn and I spoke to these </v>

1821
01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:30.180
<v Speaker 1>kids in their theater department because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's somebody asked.</v>

1822
01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody to do it.</v>

1823
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.273
<v Speaker 1>It was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they wanted me to do it about the </v>

1824
01:21:34.451 --> 01:21:35.830
<v Speaker 1>goldbergs and stuff and I was there.</v>

1825
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I was there and I and I went and I asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids.</v>

1826
01:21:38.711 --> 01:21:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you feel like your comedy is</v>

1827
01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.653
<v Speaker 1>something you have to be careful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might offend somebody in </v>

1828
01:21:46.841 --> 01:21:51.400
<v Speaker 1>your class or your school and half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>class raised their hands,</v>

1829
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.290
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those kids,</v>

1830
01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:54.880
<v Speaker 1>because I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it,</v>

1831
01:21:54.881 --> 01:21:58.090
<v Speaker 1>were mostly white and I thought that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>

1832
01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:03.270
<v Speaker 1>That's such a bummer that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression and especially your comedy,</v>

1833
01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:06.130
<v Speaker 1>is being cowed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1834
01:22:06.131 --> 01:22:08.800
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to be fair minded.</v>

1835
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those kids,</v>

1836
01:22:10.181 --> 01:22:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're racist or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1837
01:22:11.831 --> 01:22:14.970
<v Speaker 1>but when you're actually right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1838
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but we see this in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our institutions of learning,</v>

1839
01:22:17.981 --> 01:22:18.814
<v Speaker 1>especially at a higher institution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning where you're just not able to </v>

1840
01:22:21.191 --> 01:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>really an honestly express yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>god forbid,</v>

1841
01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:27.070
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god forbid it's a joke.</v>

1842
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1843
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not towing the line,</v>

1844
01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.000
<v Speaker 1>then you will be censored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:22:34.001 --> 01:22:34.834
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of demonizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people because it not demonizing </v>

1846
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.610
<v Speaker 1>white people without doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonizing white people as demonizing,</v>

1847
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:43.660
<v Speaker 1>looking for anything to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1848
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Even things that are not offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1849
01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people took more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chris rock took a lot of heat from other</v>

1850
01:22:49.481 --> 01:22:50.314
<v Speaker 1>black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1851
01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people and asian people.</v>

1852
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:53.583
<v Speaker 1>So those were all very sensitive at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when we're making big strides as </v>

1853
01:22:56.651 --> 01:22:58.770
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent and I think part</v>

1854
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:00.090
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1855
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:01.163
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the over sensitivity is because we </v>

1856
01:23:02.971 --> 01:23:05.220
<v Speaker 3>sensed that there is a lot of positive</v>

1857
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people want to keep that going </v>

1858
01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and they want to stop any racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any racism that does come up,</v>

1859
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.453
<v Speaker 1>they want to nip that shit in the bud </v>
<v Speaker 1>and let people know that it's not </v>

1860
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 1>tolerated anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is understandable,</v>

1861
01:23:16.811 --> 01:23:17.644
<v Speaker 1>but we have to know when it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When racism is real and when iT's not </v>

1862
01:23:20.321 --> 01:23:21.154
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a lot of bandwagon </v>

1863
01:23:22.571 --> 01:23:23.404
<v Speaker 1>bullshit jumping on where people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide if this is something they should </v>

1864
01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>be offended by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'll sit down with you,</v>

1865
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:30.544
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to argue with me that that's </v>

1866
01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:33.720
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no argument.</v>

1867
01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom who they just wanted to jump on it.</v>

1868
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:38.263
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like watermelon watermelon's a </v>

1869
01:23:40.361 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>stupid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watermelons,</v>

1870
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:44.200
<v Speaker 1>god damn delicious fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me the watermelon is racist.</v>

1871
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:47.170
<v Speaker 1>You're an idiot if you're telling me </v>
<v Speaker 1>grape juice.</v>

1872
01:23:47.171 --> 01:23:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Watermelon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>

1873
01:23:48.011 --> 01:23:48.844
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>

1874
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:51.630
<v Speaker 1>They're reacting though too to in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

1875
01:23:51.631 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 1>They're using what was used in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create good,</v>

1876
01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but fried chicken has always been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious food.</v>

1877
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.693
<v Speaker 1>There's no time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like something that like poor </v>

1878
01:24:02.741 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 1>people could only afford and matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

1879
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 1>when who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was running for president?</v>

1880
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it was roosevelt when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his campaign,</v>

1881
01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:12.424
<v Speaker 1>one a part of his campaign was a chicken</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every pot and the reason why is </v>

1882
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.783
<v Speaker 1>because chicken was expensive back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was saying that he was going to </v>

1883
01:24:19.831 --> 01:24:20.664
<v Speaker 1>offer prosperity to the american people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that every family would have a </v>

1884
01:24:23.561 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm offended.</v>

1885
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Fried chicken's racist now just fended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1886
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:28.563
<v Speaker 1>it's not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's racial in that it's always been in </v>

1887
01:24:31.481 --> 01:24:32.314
<v Speaker 1>some way connected with black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not something only black </v>

1888
01:24:36.701 --> 01:24:37.534
<v Speaker 1>people eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like curry when magic johnson </v>

1889
01:24:39.281 --> 01:24:40.114
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a serious ethnic for say </v>

1890
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:44.980
<v Speaker 1>someone smells like curry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's more racial.</v>

1891
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about a racist person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an indian person,</v>

1892
01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:50.500
<v Speaker 1>when magic johnson owned all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>

1893
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:51.663
<v Speaker 1>he opened starbucks in black </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods and one of the first </v>

1894
01:24:53.981 --> 01:24:54.814
<v Speaker 1>things he said is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are selling food that black </v>

1895

<v Speaker 1>to eat and here are the foods you should</v>

<v Speaker 1>of money by changing at what what they </v>

<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

1899
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:13.263

<v Speaker 1>this is back when I read about it for a </v>

1900
01:25:15.761 --> 01:25:16.780
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago,</v>

1901
01:25:16.781 --> 01:25:17.614
<v Speaker 1>more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were offering in the starbucks in </v>

1902
01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:21.544
<v Speaker 1>harlem and places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were offering things like sweet </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's cultural.</v>

1912
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:49.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a cultural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know.</v>

1913
01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:51.880
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that people were trying to</v>

<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

1915

<v Speaker 1>It is just not.</v>

1916

<v Speaker 2>this diet for more than 60 days.</v>

2003
01:29:51.911 --> 01:29:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2004
01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:53.913
<v Speaker 3>I turn my head to look out the window </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I turned back and they were </v>

2005
01:29:55.391 --> 01:29:56.021
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2006
01:29:56.021 --> 01:29:57.280
<v Speaker 3>what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swallow them all.</v>

2007
01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell her it is a drug?</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

2008
01:30:01.601 --> 01:30:04.030
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like a drug because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't get you high,</v>

2009
01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but if there's a physical reaction that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body has to sugar.</v>

2010
01:30:07.781 --> 01:30:08.614
<v Speaker 3>where when I would eat out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat a full meal and then after the meal </v>

2011
01:30:11.891 --> 01:30:12.724
<v Speaker 3>I would still be hungry for something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I was craving was either carbs </v>

2012
01:30:17.201 --> 01:30:18.034
<v Speaker 3>or I was craving cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I see like a bag of cookies and </v>

2013
01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:23.650
<v Speaker 3>cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet tooth sugar.</v>

2014
01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile I'm stuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stuffed like I ate a giant meal.</v>

2015
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a sweet tooth,</v>

2016
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:31.210
<v Speaker 3>sweet teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like that all the time.</v>

2017
01:30:31.211 --> 01:30:32.044
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's never ever not want </v>

2018
01:30:33.881 --> 01:30:34.541
<v Speaker 3>shogun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2019
01:30:34.541 --> 01:30:37.450
<v Speaker 3>But if you stopped eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like took time off,</v>

2020
01:30:37.630 --> 01:30:38.463
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you your gut bacteria would </v>
<v Speaker 3>change and that that craving would go </v>

2021
01:30:41.831 --> 01:30:43.600
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could look,</v>

2022
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.310
<v Speaker 3>I could eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's stopping me.</v>

2023
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a like a law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I'm on probation.</v>

2024
01:30:48.071 --> 01:30:50.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't have fucking sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it.</v>

2025
01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.680
<v Speaker 3>What am I not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is raw honey different in your body?</v>

2026
01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:54.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

2027
01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

2028
01:30:55.871 --> 01:30:57.530
<v Speaker 3>But it's not terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2029
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:59.710
<v Speaker 3>it's not terrible for you if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get too much of it.</v>

2030
01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:03.280
<v Speaker 3>The problem is you're only really </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to have about 25 grams of sugar</v>

2031
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:05.190
<v Speaker 3>a day if you live a healthy diet.</v>

2032
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:08.390
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm saying I'm saying good </v>
<v Speaker 3>luck in 25 grand.</v>

2033
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.800
<v Speaker 3>So I do I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2034
01:31:09.850 --> 01:31:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Or do I do count?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You count.</v>

2035
01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 3>But I think bread breaks down as glucose</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit.</v>

2036
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:15.230
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bread is sugar.</v>

2037
01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Sugar and in pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pasta,</v>

2038
01:31:18.281 --> 01:31:19.740
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I've never done that before.</v>

2041

<v Speaker 3>I've done gluten free before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What had like rice noodles and stuff </v>

<v Speaker 3>I think I talked about this before the </v>

2053
01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:02.584
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I get out of bed I don't have </v>

2054
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 3>any aches and pains anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get out a bit that'd be like,</v>

2055
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:07.683
<v Speaker 3>oh my fucking back and I'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>loosen up and I would do all these </v>

2056
01:32:11.261 --> 01:32:14.650
<v Speaker 3>exercises and shit before my body </v>
<v Speaker 3>started feeling loose again.</v>

2057
01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:15.484
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd have to like get my back move </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd get blood circulation and then </v>

2058
01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 3>once they started circulating the aix </v>
<v Speaker 3>would kind of slowly go away.</v>

2059
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any aches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get up,</v>

2060
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:24.663
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just get up and it took me a while to </v>

2061
01:32:27.311 --> 01:32:28.660
<v Speaker 3>realize that go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2062
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:31.420
<v Speaker 3>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried fasting before?</v>

2063
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:32.583
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do intermittent fasting so I eat </v>

2064
01:32:34.121 --> 01:32:35.110
<v Speaker 3>at 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

2065
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:36.003
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I don't do anything until my </v>

2066
01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:39.220
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My workout is like 10:00</v>

2067
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:41.680
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and then I workout and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I eat after my workout.</v>

2068
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:46.980
<v Speaker 3>So was for 11 hours or 12 hours or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not eating shit.</v>

2069
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.660
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All on sundays.</v>

2070
01:32:49.661 --> 01:32:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I usually fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped being saturday night,</v>

2071
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 3>usually seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't eat until the next day to seven,</v>

2072
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.380
<v Speaker 3>24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2073
01:32:56.381 --> 01:33:00.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a good meal at 9:00,</v>

2074
01:33:00.071 --> 01:33:00.904
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you finished somewhere around 10 and </v>

2075
01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:06.280
<v Speaker 3>then you let all that shit digest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then take that time off.</v>

2076
01:33:06.281 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 3>And then when you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at nine or 10,</v>

2077
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:10.023
<v Speaker 3>do a hard cardio workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kicks in your body's desire to burn </v>

2078
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:14.374
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can also get away with eating some </v>

2079
01:33:15.581 --> 01:33:16.414
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked out damn near seven days a </v>

2080
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:19.420
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2081
01:33:19.450 --> 01:33:21.480
<v Speaker 3>So you'll burn a lot of that off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

2082
01:33:21.481 --> 01:33:22.301
<v Speaker 3>It definitely will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2083
01:33:22.301 --> 01:33:23.270
<v Speaker 3>you're not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what</v>

2084
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:24.303
<v Speaker 6>the geneticists things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what epigenetics needed that </v>

2085
01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:35.730
<v Speaker 6>like a waiver.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that was the final side.</v>

2086
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 6>Obviously a very a fit</v>

2087
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:39.670
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2088
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:41.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any issues as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2089
01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:44.950
<v Speaker 3>your appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as the overall performance of</v>

2090
01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:45.784
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just wanted to give her a goof </v>

2091
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:48.520
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your show,</v>

2092
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to guide people through it for fun.</v>

2093
01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:52.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know a lot.</v>

2094
01:33:52.781 --> 01:33:53.614
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten all these tweets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook messages from all these people </v>

2095
01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do some outlandish though,</v>

2096
01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:02.470
<v Speaker 3>like an old cabbage diet for a month or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2097
01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:05.890
<v Speaker 3>But that's not unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you should do is just try it.</v>

2098
01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Try no sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2099
01:34:08.651 --> 01:34:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Look man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>

2100
01:34:09.761 --> 01:34:10.594
<v Speaker 3>I bought 10 bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those fucking chili mango things back </v>

2101
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:15.280
<v Speaker 3>there in boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those sugary bars,</v>

2102
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:16.960
<v Speaker 3>because I love him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2103
01:34:16.961 --> 01:34:20.080
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't have any pull to me.</v>

2104
01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what's the most fascinating thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this bread killed your coding.</v>

2105
01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to dinner the other day and we're</v>

2106
01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:26.873
<v Speaker 3>is tying restaurant with my family and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bread comes out and didn't mean shit to </v>

2107
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:31.190
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what they find?</v>

2108
01:34:31.191 --> 01:34:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Is that this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what I've read and heard,</v>

2109
01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:37.300
<v Speaker 3>epigeneticists got people who study how </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can turn genes on and off.</v>

2110
01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a new science.</v>

2111
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what one of the leading </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes of inflammation is?</v>

2112
01:34:42.371 --> 01:34:43.204
<v Speaker 3>Which I thought was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your gums and the food that gets stuck </v>

2113
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:51.680
<v Speaker 3>in the middle between your gums will </v>
<v Speaker 3>break down as bacteria and apparently it</v>

2114
01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:55.590
<v Speaker 3>goes into the bloodstream and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding that that has a.</v>

2115
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that that kind of bacteria,</v>

2116
01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>it has a lot</v>

2117
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 2>to do with your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart health,</v>

2118
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:03.800
<v Speaker 2>but it also has a great deal to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation in the body,</v>

2119
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.903
<v Speaker 2>which is a fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why they say one of the most </v>

2120
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:10.670
<v Speaker 2>important things you can do is floss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that noise.</v>

2121
01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:11.481
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>

2122
01:35:11.481 --> 01:35:16.481
<v Speaker 2>But that's what the floss floss floss I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do now.</v>

2123
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:23.060
<v Speaker 2>That will help me to floss picks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I let her the past week.</v>

2124
01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:23.894
<v Speaker 2>I do it twice a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dozen times in my entire life on this </v>

2125
01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got in my lungs so bad.</v>

2126
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I like to pick up my gum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you like those things?</v>

2127
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like those waterpiks.</v>

2128
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the shit and get the stuff out</v>

2129
01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.393
<v Speaker 2>of because it does as you sleep at </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks down and it goes into the </v>

2130
01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:47.000
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream and that bacteria apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a great deal to do with them.</v>

2131
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:48.860
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's good to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>gap tooth.</v>

2132
01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Get some gaps in your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2133
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:52.240
<v Speaker 2>a couple of teeth out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2134
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't want that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2135
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a thiNg for girls with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gap teeth.</v>

2136
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad that either kind a thing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>

2137
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I dated one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:03.090
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were dated,</v>

2139
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:05.100
<v Speaker 2>dated a michael strahan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2140
01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was fucking gorgeous.</v>

2142
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:12.370

<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just from speaking from personal </v>

2314
01:43:19.901 --> 01:43:21.910
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my days as a hot chick,</v>

2315
01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.133
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's overwhelming for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls to imagine your entire existence </v>

2316
01:43:26.171 --> 01:43:28.420
<v Speaker 2>is based entirely on people wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

01:43:28.421 --> 01:43:29.254
<v Speaker 2>You can find on symmetry and guys just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sending mental dick missiles at your </v>

01:43:32.111 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 2>face all day long.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I used to work at this gym where I won't</v>

2320
01:43:36.131 --> 01:43:37.200
<v Speaker 2>say her name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that noise,</v>

2321
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:38.183
<v Speaker 2>a very famous mental dick muscles is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous female celebrity would work out </v>

2322
01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:47.740
<v Speaker 2>there and she would go in the shower </v>
<v Speaker 2>before me,</v>

2323
01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:49.930

2325
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:55.423
<v Speaker 2>because there's so much pressure because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are just taking the time to bat </v>

2326
01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:00.560

<v Speaker 1>You could play his friend but you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have his hair.</v>

2403
01:47:09.961 --> 01:47:12.570
<v Speaker 1>His look and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got mad at me and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>

2405
01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it so goes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get upset at that because that's.</v>

2406
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>You got in just as easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get a goddamn phd to be a hot</v>

2407
01:47:22.171 --> 01:47:22.900
<v Speaker 1>chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2408
01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.900
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like you fucking scoured the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and and busted your ass 16 hours a</v>

2409
01:47:28.561 --> 01:47:29.394
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through doctorate your </v>

2410
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 1>dissertation and fucking writing books.</v>

2411
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 1>No pretty girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cetera.</v>

2412
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Pretend for you to be upset that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't care about you because you turned </v>

2413
01:47:40.471 --> 01:47:41.191
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2414
01:47:41.191 --> 01:47:43.050
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the wrong god damn business.</v>

2415
01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:44.063
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to care about you when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead either and you're going to </v>

2416
01:47:45.661 --> 01:47:46.494
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a certain reality to the </v>

2417
01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:49.374
<v Speaker 1>expiration date of the occupation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've chosen because you've signed up </v>

2418
01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:53.603
<v Speaker 1>for sports too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is not the fucking businesses </v>

2419
01:47:56.281 --> 01:47:58.020
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2420
01:47:58.021 --> 01:47:58.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2421
01:47:58.521 --> 01:47:59.354
<v Speaker 1>I was friends with the guy who's asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's always complaining about the lack </v>

2422
01:48:03.421 --> 01:48:06.240
<v Speaker 1>of asian roles in hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2423
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2424
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.350
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have to write a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>about asian people.</v>

2425
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:11.090
<v Speaker 1>THey're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2426
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.701
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2427
01:48:11.701 --> 01:48:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a close system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2428
01:48:13.410 --> 01:48:14.243
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to figure out a way through </v>

2429
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.673
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain way that has to be </v>

2430
01:48:19.861 --> 01:48:20.694
<v Speaker 1>available to someone to get a gig and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't have to cast you just </v>

2431
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:27.630
<v Speaker 1>because there's no asian people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving.</v>

2432
01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:28.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gone,</v>

2433
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:30.270
<v Speaker 1>that's going on in hollywood for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

2434
01:48:30.271 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 1>like the black issue in hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2435
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 1>black people take up what 12 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population in this country.</v>

2436
01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:37.543
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of very talented black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as there are a lot of very </v>

2437
01:48:39.121 --> 01:48:41.550
<v Speaker 1>talented people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is moneywise,</v>

2438
01:48:41.850 --> 01:48:42.683
<v Speaker 1>you know there's more money and making </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of movies that are geared maybe </v>

2439
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 1>toward a white populace only because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the economics.</v>

2440
01:48:51.181 --> 01:48:52.014
<v Speaker 1>There are a whole lot more audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>members that are white and and the </v>

2441
01:48:56.011 --> 01:48:58.920
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes is already fairly white,</v>

2442
01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:00.083
<v Speaker 1>so It's going to take some time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two to mandate or to kind of scold </v>

2443
01:49:03.391 --> 01:49:04.224
<v Speaker 1>hollywood because there aren't enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles or roles for black people or </v>

2444
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:10.343
<v Speaker 1>asian people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to be a little bit </v>

2445
01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.840
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the frustration,</v>

2446
01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

2447
01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:21.090
<v Speaker 1>it's reflective of demographics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2448
01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it reflective of the fact that 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population or are african</v>

2449
01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:25.824
<v Speaker 1>american?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of this country is still white and </v>

2450
01:49:28.771 --> 01:49:29.604
<v Speaker 1>it's still a business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still a business on </v>

2451
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:32.103
<v Speaker 1>addition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple months ago when grain was </v>

2452
01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:34.853
<v Speaker 1>between me and one other guy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other guy was african american male </v>

2453
01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:37.693
<v Speaker 1>agent called me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2454
01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:39.300
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did great.</v>

2455
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:42.510
<v Speaker 1>You they think you're better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>

2456
01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:45.090
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go with the better.</v>

2457
01:49:45.091 --> 01:49:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think you're better than to go with</v>

2458
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:47.383
<v Speaker 1>african americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want diversity because they don't </v>

2459
01:49:48.971 --> 01:49:50.400
<v Speaker 1>want to get people upset at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2460
01:49:50.401 --> 01:49:51.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2461
01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's effective.</v>

2462
01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 1>If it's effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're casting a movie tv show.</v>

2463
01:49:55.811 --> 01:49:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Now it is a fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2464
01:49:57.970 --> 01:49:58.803
<v Speaker 1>I just know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to cast a certain number </v>

2465
01:50:01.901 --> 01:50:05.500
<v Speaker 1>of people have quote unquote color that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2466
01:50:06.610 --> 01:50:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to.</v>

2467
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:10.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to avoid criticism,</v>

2468
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons why this </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism exists,</v>

2469
01:50:13.450 --> 01:50:14.283
<v Speaker 1>is criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially like an affirmative </v>

2470
01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>action for acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says nfl too.</v>

2471
01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:19.144
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hiring a head coach and then </v>

2472
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you have to interview a black coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

2473
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It's required.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to interview a black coach,</v>

2474
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:27.940
<v Speaker 1>so you might have six white guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2475
01:50:27.941 --> 01:50:29.320
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixth one's really good.</v>

2476
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:30.154
<v Speaker 1>I knOw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to put in this inferior </v>

2477
01:50:31.061 --> 01:50:32.790
<v Speaker 1>black yet we have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to do.</v>

2478
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:33.663
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to equalize the playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>field and create equality of </v>

2479
01:50:35.891 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing.</v>

2480
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know if that's the best way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

2481
01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the best way to do it?</v>

2482
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:42.063
<v Speaker 1>Best way to do it is to a meritocracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and create opportunities for people of </v>

2483
01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 1>all ilks and all colors earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

2484
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:51.070
<v Speaker 1>nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurture,</v>

2485
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.390
<v Speaker 1>various cultures.</v>

2486
01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Nurture the Idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2487
01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.760
<v Speaker 1>instead of taking this path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's another path.</v>

2488
01:50:57.970 --> 01:51:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see more black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2489
01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:02.224
<v Speaker 1>let's just take black more black </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and doctors over more black </v>

2490
01:51:06.131 --> 01:51:08.150
<v Speaker 1>actors and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2491
01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:12.290
<v Speaker 1>but know you just saying they want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you do it.</v>

2492
01:51:12.291 --> 01:51:15.070
<v Speaker 1>As you nurture those communities when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still young,</v>

2493
01:51:15.071 --> 01:51:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm undergoing possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Best guys should get the job.</v>

2494
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2495
01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think we've got to figure out</v>

2496
01:51:24.161 --> 01:51:27.940
<v Speaker 1>why those people aren't getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

2497
01:51:27.941 --> 01:51:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it that is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same opportunities.</v>

2498
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.390
<v Speaker 1>They're not born with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

2499
01:51:34.391 --> 01:51:39.220
<v Speaker 1>They were given a shitty deal as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hand that you're dealt as at birth.</v>

2500
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:44.280
<v Speaker 1>That's got to fix the haNd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also keep in mind when you.</v>

2501
01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 1>First of all you're talking about black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2502
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:47.150
<v Speaker 1>gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whIte people.</v>

2503
01:51:47.150 --> 01:51:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous with very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A black from black people and gay people</v>

2504
01:51:52.391 --> 01:51:53.224
<v Speaker 1>to get to a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Nigeria is very different than a </v>

2505
01:51:54.821 --> 01:51:56.860
<v Speaker 1>black guy from who grew up in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina.</v>

2506
01:51:56.861 --> 01:51:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just a completelY different culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

2507
01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.553
<v Speaker 1>The black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the african immigrant immigrant </v>

2508
01:52:01.421 --> 01:52:02.254
<v Speaker 1>experience in this country is not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from a lot of other immigrant </v>

2509
01:52:06.581 --> 01:52:08.300
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2510
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:13.350
<v Speaker 1>so culture plays a factor in Where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people start and end as well.</v>

2511
01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:16.930
<v Speaker 1>We don't talk enough about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>

2512
01:52:16.931 --> 01:52:17.764
<v Speaker 1>It's very taboo to suggest maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture if you're a white guy from the </v>

2513
01:52:21.851 --> 01:52:22.684
<v Speaker 1>appalachian mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't as effective for this marketplace </v>

2514
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.500
<v Speaker 1>as the culture of a northeastern white </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2515
01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your culture if you come from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>black minister,</v>

2516
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Mississippi black mississippians </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood or or wherever data $5,000</v>

2517
01:52:37.631 --> 01:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>from in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that documentary,</v>

2518
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it's chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that coke</v>

2519
01:52:46.110 --> 01:52:46.943
<v Speaker 2>soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the deficits in that culture </v>

2520
01:52:47.841 --> 01:52:48.674
<v Speaker 2>compared to the deaf to the advantages </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being a black kenyon or a black </v>

2521
01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:54.310
<v Speaker 2>nigerian that seems to work in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketplace.</v>

2522
01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.153
<v Speaker 2>Let's start talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to have a discussion </v>

2523
01:52:56.571 --> 01:52:57.600
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't care.</v>

2524
01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:58.473
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't really agree with what I'm </v>

2525
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.823
<v Speaker 2>saying is that culture plays a factor </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you solved the problem is look at </v>

2526
01:53:04.650 --> 01:53:06.990
<v Speaker 2>how kids are raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start with there.</v>

2527
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:08.223
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure we have a problem in </v>

2528
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:14.681
<v Speaker 2>this country where there's communities </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are grown growing up,</v>

2529
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:18.020
<v Speaker 2>where it's just despair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despair and crime.</v>

2530
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:20.060
<v Speaker 2>BaltiMore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detroit,</v>

2531
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:21.143
<v Speaker 2>me keep going down the list of terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities where people are born that </v>

2532
01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.200
<v Speaker 2>no one's doing anything to try to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government,</v>

2533
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 2>looks at all these problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>having.</v>

2534
01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 2>the people are having another other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and they're like,</v>

2535
01:53:31.551 --> 01:53:33.440
<v Speaker 2>we have to help these syrian refugees.</v>

2536
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.260
<v Speaker 2>We have to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We help people in detroit too,</v>

2537
01:53:36.261 --> 01:53:37.094
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how help people that are </v>

2538
01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:41.240
<v Speaker 2>hurting are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also dealing with a legacy of</v>

2539
01:53:41.241 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 2>raid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where racism is a legacy.</v>

2540
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Where black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what black people were redlined.</v>

2541
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy Michael Wood on who was a</v>

2542
01:53:47.691 --> 01:53:49.310
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how baltimore is a good one,</v>

2543
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.060
<v Speaker 2>great fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super articulate,</v>

2544
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.903
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's actually running for mayor of </v>

2545
01:53:53.751 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 2>chicago or excuse me for the head of </v>
<v Speaker 2>police or chicago right now and well,</v>

2546
01:53:58.551 --> 01:53:59.384
<v Speaker 2>I hope he wins because he's got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right idea and he was a cop and he's </v>

2547
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.863
<v Speaker 2>fucking super honest guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said that the way baltimore was </v>

2548
01:54:05.931 --> 01:54:06.764
<v Speaker 2>set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally couldn't sell black </v>

2549
01:54:08.661 --> 01:54:12.290
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How white called being redlined in every</v>

2550
01:54:12.291 --> 01:54:13.124
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is there a black ghetto in almost </v>

2551
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:16.010
<v Speaker 2>every community?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad part of town.</v>

2552
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:17.120
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a coincidence.</v>

2553
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:17.953
<v Speaker 2>It's black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't get a loan for a house </v>

2554
01:54:19.581 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 2>unless it was in within these lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THat's how it was.</v>

2555
01:54:23.211 --> 01:54:24.044
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you call institutionalized </v>

2556
01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:30.011
<v Speaker 2>racism and the people they didn't own </v>
<v Speaker 2>those houses they were renting and weird</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's really no.</v>

2558
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:32.623
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to go back to what we're supposed </v>

2559
01:54:34.731 --> 01:54:36.320
<v Speaker 2>to be talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to it,</v>

2560
01:54:36.321 --> 01:54:40.940
<v Speaker 2>there's really no black female fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angela hill.</v>

2561
01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was mad at me by the way,</v>

2562
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 2>for at 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent fried chicken.</v>

2563
01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.340
<v Speaker 2>She sits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she made a twitter post,</v>

2564
01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:50.413
<v Speaker 2>says this is what she hears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she had a a clip of me from my 2005 </v>

2565
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:58.670
<v Speaker 2>showtime special where I said there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>three magic words.</v>

2566
01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Love con in nigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the three magic words.</v>

2567
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.860
<v Speaker 2>And like in the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even say out loud,</v>

2568
01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.710
<v Speaker 2>not even calling.</v>

2569
01:55:06.710 --> 01:55:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Somebody can't say it out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say it out loud.</v>

2570
01:55:09.621 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 2>People could beat the fuck out of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2571
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the point of the bit,</v>

2572
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.360
<v Speaker 2>so she took an excerpt of that and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is what I hear when he says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she'll.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is the planning.</v>

2575
01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:21.373

<v Speaker 2>but if you think about there's some </v>

<v Speaker 2>but he didn't disagree.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we never faked.</v>

2636
01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:14.520

<v Speaker 2>but it might've been an older quote,</v>

2648
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2649

<v Speaker 3>he might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2650
01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:48.280
<v Speaker 3>talking about six months ago it was john</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

2654
01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:57.250
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that he said that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think was really honeSt and intense,</v>

2655
01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:02.460
<v Speaker 3>he said he used to always give himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>an excuse for losing.</v>

2656
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:04.930
<v Speaker 3>So like if I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

2657
01:59:04.931 --> 01:59:07.240

<v Speaker 3>wait till I train.</v>

2658
01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:08.440
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he kept winninG,</v>

2659
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:10.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was saying this,</v>

2662
01:59:17.561 --> 01:59:18.394
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're watching them do all that </v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

2665
01:59:22.571 --> 01:59:25.030
<v Speaker 3>The point is his body has obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed,</v>

2666
01:59:25.031 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 3>like he's been putting some serious work</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2667
01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.593
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see the physical results in his </v>

2668

<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit talking and the eMotions and all </v>

02:01:34.690 --> 02:01:35.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also not necessarily necessary </v>

2715
02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:38.403
<v Speaker 3>because matt brown went through same </v>
<v Speaker 3>injury and matt brown didn't bother </v>

2716
02:01:40.731 --> 02:01:41.564
<v Speaker 3>getting surgery and cm punk won and got </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery too and I have been through it </v>

2717
02:01:45.561 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't get surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's where I got that machine that</v>

2718

<v Speaker 3>All the yoga that I did all the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

2720
02:01:52.011 --> 02:01:52.844
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different treatments </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could do to take care of a </v>

2721
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:58.010
<v Speaker 3>bulging disc and they involve </v>
<v Speaker 3>lengthening your body,</v>

2722
02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:01.590
<v Speaker 3>stretching and decompressing your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it heals it.</v>

2723
02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 3>It can heal itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is supposed to be faster,</v>

2724
02:02:04.131 --> 02:02:04.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Just wants to that record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's this,</v>

2733
02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:21.470
<v Speaker 3>here's this back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2734
02:02:21.690 --> 02:02:22.523
<v Speaker 3>So here's the spinal column.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's got his discs right next </v>

2735
02:02:25.311 --> 02:02:25.611
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2736
02:02:25.611 --> 02:02:29.030
<v Speaker 3>one of his bulging disk is pushing </v>
<v Speaker 3>against his spine,</v>

2737
02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:29.830
<v Speaker 3>dan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2738
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:32.180
<v Speaker 3>So spinal column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his spine,</v>

2739
02:02:32.190 --> 02:02:34.580
<v Speaker 3>she's actual spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get nerve pains.</v>

2740
02:02:34.610 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 3>But that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have um,</v>

2741
02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.000
<v Speaker 3>a dyadic comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>

2742
02:02:41.001 --> 02:02:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had at both places,</v>

2743
02:02:42.561 --> 02:02:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I had a little bit of a psychotic at one</v>
<v Speaker 3>point in time.</v>

2744
02:02:44.541 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 3>And then I had it in my fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fingers was real bad though,</v>

2745
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:48.670
<v Speaker 3>but that was cervical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2746
02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:52.340
<v Speaker 3>when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just go in there,</v>

2747
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:53.263
<v Speaker 3>they open you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cut that piece out and then go </v>

2748
02:02:55.611 --> 02:02:56.444
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now it's not pressing up against </v>

2749
02:02:58.341 --> 02:02:59.174
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a chunk of your discount and you </v>

2750
02:03:02.151 --> 02:03:02.661
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2751
02:03:02.661 --> 02:03:03.494
<v Speaker 3>you have less friction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not necessarily either way that </v>

2752
02:03:05.991 --> 02:03:08.510
<v Speaker 3>mother fucker's not back for dc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2753
02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.940
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not back for dc.</v>

2754
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 3>Matt brown fixed it and matt brown fixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>it with louie simmons.</v>

2755
02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Same guy who created that reverse hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>west side barbell.</v>

2756
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:19.363
<v Speaker 3>I mean he went through a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercises and a bunch of different </v>

2757
02:03:20.991 --> 02:03:21.690
<v Speaker 3>things to fix it.</v>

2758
02:03:21.690 --> 02:03:24.680
<v Speaker 3>There's ways to fix it depending upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2759
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:25.663
<v Speaker 3>how bad the injury is with some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's herniated to the point where they </v>

2760
02:03:28.251 --> 02:03:29.084
<v Speaker 3>have to remove the disc tissue and </v>
<v Speaker 3>either put a spacer in there or the </v>

2761
02:03:31.941 --> 02:03:33.200
<v Speaker 3>fuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two discs together.</v>

2762
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Spacer is generally thought to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>better move for athletics.</v>

2763
02:03:38.361 --> 02:03:39.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought they did with </v>
<v Speaker 3>cane.</v>

2764
02:03:40.190 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2765
02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:41.913
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did a disectomy because they did a </v>

2766
02:03:42.921 --> 02:03:43.754
<v Speaker 3>space or he's out for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you just know there's no </v>

2767
02:03:46.341 --> 02:03:48.620
<v Speaker 3>wrestling going on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For awhile though.</v>

2768
02:03:48.621 --> 02:03:49.790
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a few months.</v>

2769
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:54.770
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe that that jon jones</v>
<v Speaker 3>took daniel down twice.</v>

2770
02:03:54.771 --> 02:03:55.604
<v Speaker 3>Twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

2771
02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:57.503
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he took them down the first </v>

2772
02:03:59.390 --> 02:04:02.070
<v Speaker 3>thought that was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strong.</v>

2773
02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.310
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very good.</v>

2774
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Frank meir said he's like wrestling with</v>
<v Speaker 3>jon jones.</v>

2775
02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Nobody realizes that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strong and sorted,</v>

2776
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:09.890
<v Speaker 3>sorted a good assuming stronger.</v>

2777
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:11.600
<v Speaker 3>NoW.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so crazy strong.</v>

2778
02:04:11.690 --> 02:04:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's leveraged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2779
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.220
<v Speaker 3>it's all the above is also a juco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>National champ.</v>

2780
02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.850
<v Speaker 3>He's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cradle.</v>

2781
02:04:19.851 --> 02:04:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Ryan bader didn't cradle him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was,</v>

2782
02:04:21.831 --> 02:04:22.664
<v Speaker 3>it was a battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did that too where he just put him in a </v>

2783
02:04:24.261 --> 02:04:26.780
<v Speaker 3>cradle and just the show run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2784
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:29.630
<v Speaker 3>he literally didn't watch it other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rumbled did.</v>

2785
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:31.940
<v Speaker 3>That was horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2786
02:04:32.150 --> 02:04:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Rumbles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

2787
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:35.240
<v Speaker 3>He scared me more than I want to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>rumble fight.</v>

2788
02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:36.873
<v Speaker 3>Jon jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's whether or not rumble can continue </v>

2789
02:04:39.541 --> 02:04:40.374
<v Speaker 3>that sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think jan's takes him down </v>

2790
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>deep into the second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third floor.</v>

2791
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 3>People are going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They already have figured it out.</v>

2792
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel,</v>

2793
02:04:46.441 --> 02:04:48.060
<v Speaker 3>did you drag on the later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2794
02:04:48.061 --> 02:04:50.010
<v Speaker 3>You avoid The big punch dragon in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>later rounds.</v>

2795
02:04:50.230 --> 02:04:53.610
<v Speaker 3>John's change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can a guy like him?</v>

2796
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Can a guy like rumble change?</v>

2797
02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:58.980
<v Speaker 3>She's obviously changed and gotten way </v>
<v Speaker 3>better in the avoiding the weight cut.</v>

2798
02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Becoming a real natural two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2799
02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:01.494
<v Speaker 3>five pounder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny change in far as like not being </v>

2800
02:05:04.531 --> 02:05:08.040
<v Speaker 3>able to be broken the way dc broke up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with josh koscheck.</v>

2801
02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Vito belfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken.</v>

2802
02:05:10.410 --> 02:05:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're born with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of your personality,</v>

2803
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:16.110
<v Speaker 3>so whether whether or not you allow your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind to go down,</v>

2804
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:18.750
<v Speaker 3>those psychologists can probably help </v>
<v Speaker 3>you disagree.</v>

2805
02:05:18.751 --> 02:05:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2806
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Is iT possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2807
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:24.030
<v Speaker 3>are there examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole lot it's like,</v>

2808
02:05:24.070 --> 02:05:25.740
<v Speaker 3>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been broke?</v>

2809
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:29.310
<v Speaker 3>But how can you say it's not possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's mental.</v>

2810
02:05:29.311 --> 02:05:30.144
<v Speaker 3>If it's mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's most certainly don't tHink it's a </v>

2811
02:05:31.651 --> 02:05:34.920
<v Speaker 3>personality trait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible for me to win the high</v>

2812
02:05:34.921 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 3>jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have it physically right now.</v>

2813
02:05:38.521 --> 02:05:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Let's say for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him though,</v>

2814
02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:42.780
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind issue,</v>

2815
02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:43.500
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

2816
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Why couldn't a man adjust the way he </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks at the world?</v>

2817
02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it possible that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a rigorous disciplined,</v>

2818
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.373
<v Speaker 3>like very focused attempt to change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you approach various scenarios and </v>

2819
02:05:57.361 --> 02:05:58.194
<v Speaker 3>dilemmas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it possible that you could change </v>

2820
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:01.044
<v Speaker 3>your thinking and wouldn't that be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely that you could become more </v>

2821
02:06:03.511 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 3>mentally tough than it would be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like this physical free because</v>

2822
02:06:07.441 --> 02:06:11.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a physical thing in cardio makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>brings out the weakness in people,</v>

2823
02:06:11.431 --> 02:06:12.264
<v Speaker 3>so what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can put them through these crazy </v>

2824
02:06:13.771 --> 02:06:15.930
<v Speaker 3>cardio challenges and have a mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach there.</v>

2825
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Now here's The point where usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>

2826
02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I say.</v>

2827
02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:20.413
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know nearly enough grappling </v>

2828
02:06:21.871 --> 02:06:24.120
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a big part of the issUe</v>

2829
02:06:24.450 --> 02:06:25.283
<v Speaker 3>was he was getting mad dogged by a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was an olympic caliber wrestler and </v>

2830
02:06:29.161 --> 02:06:30.720
<v Speaker 3>daniel cormier was just ragging him all.</v>

2831
02:06:30.730 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I know he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he did.</v>

2832
02:06:32.071 --> 02:06:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2833
02:06:33.610 --> 02:06:34.650
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he didn't.</v>

2836
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:47.790
<v Speaker 3>deep knowledge of submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also a lot of catch.</v>

2837
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:48.833

<v Speaker 3>He's very knowledgeable about catch </v>

2846
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:10.290
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut it off.</v>

2847
02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:12.990
<v Speaker 3>The ronnie lott.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of that.</v>

2848
02:07:13.170 --> 02:07:14.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had his toe cut off so he could keep </v>

2849
02:07:16.861 --> 02:07:19.560
<v Speaker 3>rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

2850
02:07:19.561 --> 02:07:20.394
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I going to go into that terrible mental </v>

2851
02:07:22.771 --> 02:07:23.604
<v Speaker 3>fortitude ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going back to the mental thing with a </v>

2852
02:07:26.131 --> 02:07:27.120
<v Speaker 3>mental coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2853
02:07:27.121 --> 02:07:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes there's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2854
02:07:30.721 --> 02:07:31.610
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people,</v>

2855
02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:34.650
<v Speaker 3>it's just in their dna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just break easier now when she gets</v>

2856
02:07:34.651 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>a dna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think</v>

2857
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:38.320
<v Speaker 4>it is is it being a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong,</v>

2858
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:42.040
<v Speaker 4>tough guy and being used to being the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer and then when you're the nail you</v>

2859
02:07:42.041 --> 02:07:44.280
<v Speaker 4>can't handle it and you fall apart </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's an n.</v>

2860
02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:47.680
<v Speaker 4>You're uncovering your unaccustomed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it rather than a guy like,</v>

2861
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:50.170
<v Speaker 4>here's a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>darren elkins,</v>

2862
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.273
<v Speaker 4>you can hit that motherfucker with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>baseball bat and he keeps coming </v>

2863
02:07:52.871 --> 02:07:54.170
<v Speaker 4>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's used to getting beat on.</v>

2864
02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:55.780
<v Speaker 4>He's not a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a tough guy.</v>

2865
02:07:55.810 --> 02:08:00.070
<v Speaker 4>John jones isn't the only had him with </v>
<v Speaker 4>jon jones is a fairly trained,</v>

2866
02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:00.993
<v Speaker 4>was getting beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John jones has two big brothers and his </v>

2867
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:04.744
<v Speaker 4>bigger brother beat his ass all through </v>
<v Speaker 4>his life and I think he's accustomed to </v>

2868
02:08:06.911 --> 02:08:10.270
<v Speaker 4>getting his ass beat by his big brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think his brother arthur didn't have a</v>

2869
02:08:10.271 --> 02:08:13.840
<v Speaker 4>fantastic service and being bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking his ass for sure,</v>

2870
02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:16.570
<v Speaker 4>but I think it goes in two ways.</v>

2871
02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Either you're born with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2872
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:23.580
<v Speaker 4>or some traumatic event in your life </v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe it's has something to do with</v>

2873
02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:25.840
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it doesn't,</v>

2874
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:29.200
<v Speaker 4>but it switches on that quit and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your in your mind and your body.</v>

2875
02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 4>Some of it's just mental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it's physical.</v>

2876
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Your body gives out or your brain gives </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2877
02:08:34.090 --> 02:08:35.890
<v Speaker 4>I think there's multiple ways to look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2878
02:08:35.891 --> 02:08:39.790
<v Speaker 4>Obviously vinny shoreman could fix him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finished romans a hitman chest.</v>

2879
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Shout out tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mind coach vinny.</v>

2880
02:08:43.090 --> 02:08:44.620
<v Speaker 4>That's what he calls himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My approach.</v>

2881
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:45.663
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it can definitely be a learned </v>

2882
02:08:47.801 --> 02:08:48.634
<v Speaker 4>behavior to to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's you got taught that or you </v>

2883
02:08:52.511 --> 02:08:55.730
<v Speaker 4>got that imposed on you or someone made </v>
<v Speaker 4>you break when you.</v>

2884
02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 4>It's a habit that there's just a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways to go about it,</v>

2885
02:08:59.531 --> 02:09:01.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not saying something bad happened in his</v>

2886
02:09:01.691 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2887
02:09:02.050 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was something good that made </v>
<v Speaker 4>him say,</v>

2888
02:09:03.521 --> 02:09:04.211
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

2889
02:09:04.211 --> 02:09:08.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think at his level he's gotten a</v>

2890
02:09:08.430 --> 02:09:09.263
<v Speaker 4>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think he's ever talked to </v>

2891
02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:10.993
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fighters that have </v>

2892
02:09:11.741 --> 02:09:12.574
<v Speaker 4>never gotten a mental coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I asked cowboy about it and he's </v>

2893
02:09:14.231 --> 02:09:15.130
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2894
02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I can't put laughed in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2895

<v Speaker 4>coach.</v>

2896

<v Speaker 4>Tazzy do you think cowboys at a mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>coach?</v>

2897
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:26.290
<v Speaker 4>I don'T know why you're making that </v>
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

2898
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 4>you think he's a liar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Why don't you talk to yourself?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm my worst on my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when I went out for news radio,</v>

2946
02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:22.820
<v Speaker 1>there was two auditions for news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was a cattle call.</v>

2947
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It was like 100 people's giant long </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

2952
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.353
<v Speaker 1>like on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had decided to write it where they </v>

2953
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:42.050
<v Speaker 1>will weed out all the hams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want anybody to read it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Script wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2959
02:11:57.531 --> 02:11:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I just pretended it was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2960
02:11:59.930 --> 02:12:00.763
<v Speaker 1>that's all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did it like it was really </v>

2961
02:12:01.611 --> 02:12:02.444
<v Speaker 1>happening and so then there was only </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a few people that apparently made </v>

2962
02:12:06.111 --> 02:12:09.320
<v Speaker 1>the cut and then I went in there for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second audition.</v>

2963
02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:10.333
<v Speaker 1>It was Me and three other dudes who </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like they were about to fucking </v>

2964

<v Speaker 1>They were sweating and they were pale </v>

2965
02:12:18.170 --> 02:12:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 26 at the time so it was only like</v>

<v Speaker 1>four years removed from my last fight or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2967
02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:25.453
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at all these guys all </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous and sweaty and I sat on the </v>

2968

<v Speaker 1>couch and I put my feet up and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even read the script.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pressure because this is going to be </v>

02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:10.813
<v Speaker 1>Looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy looked like he was about </v>

2986
02:13:12.591 --> 02:13:16.040
<v Speaker 1>to get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The they look like they're about to die.</v>

2987
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:17.273
<v Speaker 1>And so that alone gave me massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence and I went in there super </v>

2988
02:13:21.591 --> 02:13:23.530
<v Speaker 1>loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super loose and relaxed.</v>

2989
02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's between me and these pussies,</v>

2990
02:13:25.850 --> 02:13:26.451

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And they can sense that constantly to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2993
02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it on purpose</v>

2994
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.813
<v Speaker 2>for the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I was competing against </v>

2995
02:13:33.691 --> 02:13:34.441
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2996
02:13:34.441 --> 02:13:35.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2997
02:13:35.121 --> 02:13:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I never get.</v>

2998
02:13:37.321 --> 02:13:38.154
<v Speaker 2>I don't get nervous by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get nervous when I have to </v>

2999
02:13:40.411 --> 02:13:44.190
<v Speaker 2>perform ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the only time because my mind</v>

3000
02:13:44.191 --> 02:13:45.024
<v Speaker 2>is telling myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so ridiculous to be nervous that </v>

3001
02:13:47.071 --> 02:13:50.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally sabotaging myself where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was nervous.</v>

3002
02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not ridiculous that you care and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will not do the wrong thing.</v>

3003
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.980
<v Speaker 2>The wrong thing about money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not being in the moment.</v>

3004
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>You the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't do that.</v>

3005
02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:03.990
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it for the wrong reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if you don't want to act,</v>

3006
02:14:04.050 --> 02:14:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I've never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be.</v>

3007
02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.313
<v Speaker 2>There might be like god the money I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make or if I wouldn't say I've </v>

3008
02:14:10.021 --> 02:14:12.810
<v Speaker 2>never once ever in my life thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's because I'm lying.</v>

3009
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm lying to myself when I go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>

3010
02:14:15.850 --> 02:14:19.830
<v Speaker 2>like I can go and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go all the way and then I get in there</v>

3011
02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:20.664
<v Speaker 2>and now it's just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's because I'm being a </v>

3012
02:14:23.431 --> 02:14:24.940
<v Speaker 2>liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll be,</v>

3013
02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3014
02:14:27.601 --> 02:14:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Because I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want it to.</v>

3015
02:14:30.090 --> 02:14:30.923
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with the exception of one point in </v>

3016
02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:35.850
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was doing it at one point in time.</v>

3017
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:39.330
<v Speaker 2>You deeply wanted to be on a sitcom like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

3018
02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:40.193
<v Speaker 2>It was all you wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't even doing standup for part </v>

3019
02:14:43.690 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 2>thing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot of plays.</v>

3020
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot who are pretending to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be an actor.</v>

3021
02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:52.140
<v Speaker 2>It was just like you would talk like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

3022
02:14:52.141 --> 02:14:52.974
<v Speaker 2>You don't that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're relaxed when he's around </v>

<v Speaker 2>executives like it was.</v>

3024
02:14:59.930 --> 02:15:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3027
02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:08.130
<v Speaker 2>progressive and overemphasize how good </v>
<v Speaker 2>he could.</v>

3028
02:15:08.131 --> 02:15:09.780
<v Speaker 2>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing.</v>

3029

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3030

3031
02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:19.380
<v Speaker 2>when you guys were friends from the </v>

<v Speaker 2>The worst environment in my opinion,</v>

3037
02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:38.000
<v Speaker 2>is those sketch shows because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>is scrambling and being completed.</v>

3071
02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:10.480
<v Speaker 3>News radio and I'd love to because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just the best case scenario.</v>

3072
02:17:10.850 --> 02:17:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great talented actors,</v>

3073
02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:15.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the above was and it never was </v>

3074
02:17:17.061 --> 02:17:17.894
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is perfect because everybody had </v>

3075
02:17:19.161 --> 02:17:20.900
<v Speaker 3>to keep trying and nobody ever got a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

3076
02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:22.860
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never made it.</v>

3077
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:23.743
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it barely putt putt putt barely stayed </v>

3078
02:17:25.431 --> 02:17:26.264
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a perfect environment like with </v>

3079
02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:31.700
<v Speaker 3>some really talented people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still one of the greatest sitcoms ever.</v>

3080
02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:35.090
<v Speaker 3>And you enjoyed the whole process?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't enjoy as much as I enjoyed</v>

3081
02:17:35.091 --> 02:17:35.924
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I enjoyed it immensely and way more </v>

3082
02:17:37.731 --> 02:17:42.340
<v Speaker 3>than I enjoyed any other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After that I saw after that I,</v>

3083
02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I had development deals for like a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>or two where I.</v>

3084
02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Which means what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give you some money and they try to</v>

3085
02:17:49.111 --> 02:17:52.610
<v Speaker 3>put together a sitcom and it's based </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>

3086
02:17:52.611 --> 02:17:54.980
<v Speaker 3>And tHen I got a chance to see what it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3087
02:17:54.980 --> 02:17:55.813
<v Speaker 3>And just actors are like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians without punchlines like the </v>

3088
02:18:01.581 --> 02:18:03.440
<v Speaker 3>worst comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning not like the worst,</v>

3089
02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:06.950
<v Speaker 3>like not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mean the most crazy,</v>

3090
02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:12.340
<v Speaker 3>the most neurotic in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual act itself of auditioning and</v>

3091
02:18:13.701 --> 02:18:16.730
<v Speaker 3>trying to get gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It enforces that it.</v>

3092
02:18:16.970 --> 02:18:19.880
<v Speaker 3>You're always trying to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>love you.</v>

3093
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:23.480
<v Speaker 3>You can always looking for approval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can never just be,</v>

3094
02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:25.453
<v Speaker 3>be at peace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always worried that you have to </v>

02:18:28.671 --> 02:18:31.280
<v Speaker 3>say the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be liberal.</v>

3096
02:18:31.490 --> 02:18:33.680

<v Speaker 3>if you are a republican,</v>

3097

<v Speaker 2>nonsensical.</v>

3202
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's award shows for comedy or </v>

<v Speaker 3>anatomy for real shit.</v>

3262
02:25:55.931 --> 02:25:58.480
<v Speaker 3>So it's a great way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the implications.</v>

3263
02:25:58.481 --> 02:26:00.910
<v Speaker 3>People right now scream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking twitter.</v>

3264
02:26:00.911 --> 02:26:04.310

<v Speaker 3>It's opinions ladies and gentlemen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3266
02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:08.073
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about it also to me </v>

3267
02:26:10.541 --> 02:26:14.350
<v Speaker 3>because this is a subject that I am </v>
<v Speaker 3>engrossed in,</v>

3268
02:26:14.610 --> 02:26:17.950
<v Speaker 3>like almost every next week I read about</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence.</v>

3269
02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Almost everyday I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to scientific american,</v>

3270
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:23.650
<v Speaker 3>I got all these different websites and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>search.</v>

3271
02:26:23.651 --> 02:26:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I will look up artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to news,</v>

3272
02:26:26.890 --> 02:26:27.723
<v Speaker 3>read tHe latest shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I am is one of the main subjects </v>

3273
02:26:31.241 --> 02:26:34.420
<v Speaker 3>that repeats in my mind like a metronome</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day long.</v>

3274
02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:35.283
<v Speaker 3>That's your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why you love the movie and </v>

3275
02:26:36.421 --> 02:26:38.860
<v Speaker 3>it's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to change our paradigm.</v>

3276
02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be the future of </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3277
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:42.063
<v Speaker 3>I think I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to have rules that </v>

3278
02:26:44.021 --> 02:26:46.990
<v Speaker 3>are established by artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and that's gonna.</v>

3279
02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:48.033
<v Speaker 3>That's gOnna be how we decide and act </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how we decide and make choices to </v>

3280
02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:53.110
<v Speaker 3>see the robots are going to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>running.</v>

3281
02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe that.</v>

3282
02:26:54.341 --> 02:26:55.174
<v Speaker 3>I think that's going to be the solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the cult of personality that we're </v>

3283
02:26:56.771 --> 02:26:59.770
<v Speaker 3>dealing with right now with Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>being the front runner for president.</v>

3284
02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:01.390
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you right now,</v>

3285
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:04.090
<v Speaker 3>hillary clinton is not going to beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>

3286
02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:06.053
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is.</v>

3287
02:27:06.130 --> 02:27:06.851
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not.</v>

3288
02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out of your mind.</v>

3289
02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Is telling you the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the numbers,</v>

3290
02:27:11.351 --> 02:27:14.010
<v Speaker 3>any political pundit and the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't add up for trump.</v>

3291
02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:14.973
<v Speaker 3>Not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying the numbers didn't add </v>

3292
02:27:16.181 --> 02:27:18.430
<v Speaker 3>up for him six months ago and they said </v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have a chance.</v>

3293
02:27:18.431 --> 02:27:21.550
<v Speaker 3>And that sounds like changing are by far</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now unless something changes,</v>

3294
02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:25.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of see this guy to get acting gigs.</v>

3295

02:29:28.701 --> 02:29:31.100
<v Speaker 3>you cannot have a leader who's by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3347
02:29:31.430 --> 02:29:33.950
<v Speaker 3>hugely anti marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3348
02:29:33.951 --> 02:29:35.520
<v Speaker 3>marijuana farm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>

3351
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:41.743
<v Speaker 3>You're doing something that's way worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your body than marijuana ever will </v>

3352
02:29:45.171 --> 02:29:46.004
<v Speaker 3>be critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand who is going to </v>

3353
02:29:49.371 --> 02:29:52.490

3354
02:29:52.491 --> 02:29:53.324
<v Speaker 3>he's got a real chance right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So participants doing the gops polls </v>

3355
02:29:56.411 --> 02:29:58.190
<v Speaker 3>show both clinton and sanders smoking </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

3356
02:30:00.050 --> 02:30:01.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

3357
02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:03.680
<v Speaker 3>donald trump's not going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president and listen that crazy.</v>

3358
02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:07.070
<v Speaker 3>It happened so doom the gop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie sanders be trump,</v>

3359
02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:08.793
<v Speaker 3>but that's paul's man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pulls are only people willing to answer </v>

3360
02:30:11.031 --> 02:30:15.470
<v Speaker 3>polls and they were really bad polls </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be representative of the winter.</v>

3361
02:30:15.471 --> 02:30:16.304
<v Speaker 3>They would go exit polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were so off with with bush versus </v>

3362
02:30:19.371 --> 02:30:22.580
<v Speaker 3>kerry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were so off that they haven't.</v>

3363
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:24.830
<v Speaker 3>They haven't been actually paul's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just numbers.</v>

3364
02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:26.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the political pundits who really</v>

3365
02:30:26.481 --> 02:30:28.940
<v Speaker 3>are in the know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When brian went bullshitting,</v>

3366
02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:33.530
<v Speaker 3>he does this thing where he calms down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and instead of getting emotional he just</v>

3367
02:30:33.531 --> 02:30:33.831
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3368
02:30:33.831 --> 02:30:37.490
<v Speaker 3>it was more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he gets like,</v>

3369
02:30:37.491 --> 02:30:41.480
<v Speaker 3>I think his dad used to like chastise </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and he would say something stupid.</v>

3370
02:30:41.690 --> 02:30:44.280
<v Speaker 3>His dad would know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My dad would yell,</v>

3371
02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:45.680
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3372
02:30:45.681 --> 02:30:46.311
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't do that.</v>

3373
02:30:46.311 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My father would do this.</v>

3374
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead and start making it started </v>
<v Speaker 3>making a point.</v>

3375
02:30:49.761 --> 02:30:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try this.</v>

3376
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christie faces calls to quit approval.</v>

3377
02:30:54.531 --> 02:30:59.531
<v Speaker 3>Drop after backing trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering why six newspapers calling</v>

3378
02:30:59.721 --> 02:31:00.554
<v Speaker 3>for him to resign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The newspapers were they have people </v>

3379
02:31:04.161 --> 02:31:07.460
<v Speaker 3>with opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they asking him to resign?</v>

3380
02:31:07.970 --> 02:31:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Resign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What though?</v>

3381
02:31:09.261 --> 02:31:13.790
<v Speaker 3>As governor of New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why for endorsing trump?</v>

3382
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:17.180
<v Speaker 3>He's just not a good leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not,</v>

3383
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:20.210
<v Speaker 3>he's not a wise man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says things.</v>

3384
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:21.053
<v Speaker 1>who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump?</v>

3385
02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:22.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>christie trump.</v>

3386
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I think trump is more of a showman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think christine,</v>

3387
02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:29.070
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie says foolish things.</v>

3388
02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:30.083
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish things that aren't backed by </v>

3389
02:31:31.171 --> 02:31:32.004
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very discriminatory when it comes </v>

3390
02:31:33.811 --> 02:31:34.644
<v Speaker 1>to my beloved marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't listen to chris christie when </v>

3391
02:31:36.841 --> 02:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you're that fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't take you serious.</v>

3392
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:39.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>

3393
02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:41.720
<v Speaker 1>You have no discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't agree with that.</v>

3394
02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:43.133
<v Speaker 1>I know he's no discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When winston churchill who was a </v>

3395
02:31:47.681 --> 02:31:51.000
<v Speaker 1>different touch ran and roe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3396
02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:51.834
<v Speaker 1>that's english.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that somebody has a weight </v>

3397
02:31:53.071 --> 02:31:53.904
<v Speaker 1>problem and they wouldn't be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective leader to me is it doesn't </v>

3398
02:31:56.131 --> 02:31:57.180
<v Speaker 1>hold water at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3399
02:31:57.181 --> 02:31:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Who's the fattest president we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>had?</v>

3400
02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:02.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not an effective argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3401
02:32:02.010 --> 02:32:02.843
<v Speaker 1>first will be prejudicial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When churchill was from a long time ago </v>

3402
02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and alcohol was celebrated then as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manly thing to consume.</v>

3403
02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:14.370
<v Speaker 1>If You took the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took the fat ratio,</v>

3404
02:32:14.371 --> 02:32:15.204
<v Speaker 1>if you took a whatever it is the body </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat test on some of the ceos are great </v>

3405
02:32:20.791 --> 02:32:22.920
<v Speaker 1>inventors or scientists or whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

3406
02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:23.773
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know tHat I'm talking about </v>

3407
02:32:26.041 --> 02:32:29.910
<v Speaker 1>president president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any numbers right now.</v>

3408
02:32:29.911 --> 02:32:32.400
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a fact that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that because somebody is</v>

3409
02:32:32.401 --> 02:32:34.170
<v Speaker 1>fat and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has discipline.</v>

3410
02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:36.180
<v Speaker 1>That's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3411
02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:37.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3412
02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>He's not just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3413
02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:39.893
<v Speaker 1>He's not fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fat guy who's undergone an </v>

3414
02:32:41.101 --> 02:32:42.650
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be fat anymore.</v>

3415
02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He's still fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying that you can be.</v>

3416
02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:47.940
<v Speaker 1>You can be not discipline in one area or</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3417
02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:51.600
<v Speaker 1>but have a huge brain and huge intellect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that either,</v>

3418
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:54.480
<v Speaker 1>but he says foolish things and he's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a different story.</v>

3419
02:32:54.481 --> 02:32:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying in general 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>

3420
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:57.203
<v Speaker 1>when you generalize and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not vote for somebody or take </v>

3421
02:32:59.971 --> 02:33:03.090
<v Speaker 1>somebody's seriously as a leader because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fat for me.</v>

3422
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying for me,</v>

3423
02:33:06.601 --> 02:33:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

3424
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:09.510
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it is,</v>

3425
02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's also judging someone based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own personal choices.</v>

3426
02:33:12.810 --> 02:33:13.643
<v Speaker 1>The choices that you make to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>addict and to not seek out healthy food </v>

3427
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.100
<v Speaker 1>and to seek out body harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His body is out of whack.</v>

3428
02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>He's like grossly overweight and he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>through going under like he,</v>

3429
02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:29.550
<v Speaker 1>he gave in saying that like I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discipline to deal with my issue,</v>

3430
02:33:29.610 --> 02:33:32.880
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm going to do is go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor and get cut open so my stomach is</v>

3431
02:33:32.881 --> 02:33:33.714
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that there are a lot </v>

3432
02:33:34.621 --> 02:33:36.390
<v Speaker 1>of great writers there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last thing,</v>

3433
02:33:36.450 --> 02:33:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King,</v>

3434
02:33:37.450 --> 02:33:38.390
<v Speaker 1>county major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3435
02:33:38.730 --> 02:33:40.170
<v Speaker 1>don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't matter.</v>

3436
02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:41.610
<v Speaker 1>That's not related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3437
02:33:41.611 --> 02:33:42.444
<v Speaker 1>THe major alcohol problem that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>was part of his creative process and </v>

3438
02:33:45.541 --> 02:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>that he was a giant books.</v>

3439
02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:51.160
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a book on writing write,</v>

3440
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:53.190
<v Speaker 1>so I read that book to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he say in the book?</v>

3441
02:33:53.191 --> 02:33:54.690
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about cell.</v>

3442
02:33:54.691 --> 02:33:57.870
<v Speaker 1>He used to drink and do coke and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would find these fucking.</v>

3443
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.823
<v Speaker 1>It was a part of his process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized it was killing him because </v>

3444
02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:03.300
<v Speaker 1>he stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ChrisTie is still eating like a pig.</v>

3445
02:34:03.301 --> 02:34:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Stephen king makes a very important is </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an artist.</v>

3446
02:34:07.501 --> 02:34:08.334
<v Speaker 1>He's not a leader of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand if you don't want to vote </v>

3447
02:34:11.221 --> 02:34:12.054
<v Speaker 1>for your leader because he's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that the idea that </v>

3448
02:34:14.431 --> 02:34:17.860
<v Speaker 1>somebody wouldn't be effective because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a weight problem is erroneous.</v>

3449
02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just tell me the biggest president we've</v>

3450
02:34:20.621 --> 02:34:21.830
<v Speaker 2>ever had and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the?</v>

3451
02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Who's the president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a good argument though,</v>

3452
02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:30.540
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have a ball president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it was pretty fast.</v>

3453
02:34:30.611 --> 02:34:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Thicker than a snickers right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3454
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Especially back charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's huge,</v>

3455
02:34:37.781 --> 02:34:39.430
<v Speaker 2>but was he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was he a good president?</v>

3456
02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:42.513
<v Speaker 2>Taft was a only input in power for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very short period back when people were </v>

3457
02:34:45.461 --> 02:34:47.890
<v Speaker 2>starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you were a fat.</v>

3458
02:34:47.891 --> 02:34:50.210
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome when people were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

3459
02:34:50.610 --> 02:34:51.443
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eating and eating and eating and had </v>

3460
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:55.930
<v Speaker 2>been been rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It to the fact that we live in a cUlture</v>

3461
02:34:55.931 --> 02:34:58.520
<v Speaker 2>now where there's body shaming.</v>

3467
02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:16.033

<v Speaker 2>and they don't meet with the other </v>

3468
02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:18.910
<v Speaker 2>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be right.</v>

3469
02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:21.470
<v Speaker 2>This is post surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3470
02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:23.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline issue,</v>

3471
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:26.200
<v Speaker 2>real discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hired an agent I.</v>

3472
02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:28.480
<v Speaker 2>We were talking on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was great on paper.</v>

3473
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I met him in person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>

3474
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:31.480
<v Speaker 2>He was letting some stuff slip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3475
02:35:31.481 --> 02:35:32.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weirD.</v>

3476
02:35:32.130 --> 02:35:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Me and person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 400 pounds.</v>

3477
02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3478
02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:38.140
<v Speaker 2>They're often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of discipline issue.</v>

3479
02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:39.013
<v Speaker 2>There has to be day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be in discipline in one side of </v>

3480
02:35:40.721 --> 02:35:42.790
<v Speaker 2>your life and very disciplined another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

3481
02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:45.490
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's compartmentalized and sometimes you</v>

3482
02:35:45.491 --> 02:35:48.760
<v Speaker 2>do have an issue and clearly that is a a</v>
<v Speaker 2>food issue,</v>

3483
02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:49.893
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want the president United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States struggling with his diet when he </v>

3484
02:35:54.191 --> 02:35:55.480
<v Speaker 2>has to make this huge decision.</v>

3485
02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:56.313
<v Speaker 2>Going back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest fight in his life and his </v>

3486
02:35:57.821 --> 02:36:00.070
<v Speaker 2>health is in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>King makes her interesting distinction.</v>

3487
02:36:00.071 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Just somebody brought him up and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3488
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I was a very talented guy with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance abuse problem.</v>

3489
02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.193
<v Speaker 2>That's what he saId.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people make the mistake of </v>

3490
02:36:06.461 --> 02:36:09.490
<v Speaker 2>saying that my substance abuse was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason I was so talented.</v>

3491
02:36:09.491 --> 02:36:10.190
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nah,</v>

3492
02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:11.023
<v Speaker 2>that's not necessarily what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he said was that the creative </v>

3493
02:36:13.301 --> 02:36:16.240
<v Speaker 2>process was enhanced by his substance </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse problem.</v>

3494
02:36:16.390 --> 02:36:17.770
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case,</v>

3495
02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:18.993
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a Stephen King.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fan is shit that he wrote when he was </v>

3496
02:36:21.851 --> 02:36:22.840
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's better.</v>

3497
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does better.</v>

3498
02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.730
<v Speaker 2>He's also an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big difference,</v>

3499
02:36:27.731 --> 02:36:28.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my hardest.</v>

3500
02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Students wouldn't want Stephen King when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was coked up balancing my checkbook,</v>

3501
02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:35.990
<v Speaker 2>but expanding your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to get in there.</v>

3502
02:36:36.310 --> 02:36:38.020
<v Speaker 2>You need to have fucking disciplined.</v>

3503
02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:40.630
<v Speaker 2>To be a president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be a healthy person.</v>

3504
02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:43.290
<v Speaker 2>You also need to be a role model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not.</v>

3505
02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a figurehead for the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>of America.</v>

3506
02:36:45.641 --> 02:36:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as just saying Jack </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy was a huge womanizer.</v>

3507
02:36:50.570 --> 02:36:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Consider no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing,</v>

3508
02:36:53.351 --> 02:36:54.340
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing.</v>

3509
02:36:54.341 --> 02:36:55.990
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we didn't know.</v>

3510
02:36:56.290 --> 02:36:59.900
<v Speaker 2>No one knew back the slop what's right </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of his face.</v>

3511
02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:03.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then the world was different,</v>

3512
02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but it was a breakdown in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in self control,</v>

3513
02:37:06.491 --> 02:37:07.324
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In one way or an ab or it was just </v>

3514
02:37:08.441 --> 02:37:13.441
<v Speaker 2>standard operational procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don'T become a leader by just dating one</v>

3515
02:37:13.601 --> 02:37:14.680
<v Speaker 2>chip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3516
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Is dick</v>

3517
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.180
<v Speaker 1>slingers presidential fixing it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>food though,</v>

3518
02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:21.230
<v Speaker 1>is all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3519
02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing though because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't enough.</v>

3520
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:25.840
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't interfering with his health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like chris christie,</v>

3521
02:37:25.841 --> 02:37:26.674
<v Speaker 1>his physical body is 10 years massively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively falling apart and the guy got </v>

3522
02:37:32.421 --> 02:37:35.240
<v Speaker 1>a fucking operation and it didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

3523
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Me still grossly overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he used to be way bigger.</v>

3524
02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:39.513
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Killing must want my president of </v>

3525
02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:43.640
<v Speaker 1>superhero kind of being a contrarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3526
02:37:43.700 --> 02:37:44.533
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't know if it bothers me </v>

3527
02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:47.030
<v Speaker 1>or not what I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you.</v>

3528
02:37:47.170 --> 02:37:48.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

3529
02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I understand that explore and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

3530
02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Where sport would it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it bother you?</v>

3531
02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:54.080
<v Speaker 1>You said you don't know if it bothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3532
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Just health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Health is important for presence,</v>

3533
02:37:56.151 --> 02:37:57.680
<v Speaker 1>like they have to go through all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>health checks.</v>

3534
02:37:57.980 --> 02:37:59.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why trump came out and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3535
02:37:59.481 --> 02:38:00.920
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in great shape.</v>

3536
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:03.830
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read obama shit.</v>

3537
02:38:03.970 --> 02:38:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that I think that I'm not trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a contrarian at all.</v>

3538
02:38:07.791 --> 02:38:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I understand and respect somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view where they say,</v>

3539
02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:11.413
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not able to control your own </v>

3540
02:38:13.521 --> 02:38:14.354
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore I wonder what your judgment </v>

3541
02:38:16.161 --> 02:38:18.080
<v Speaker 1>would be like as a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent valid.</v>

3542
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:20.510
<v Speaker 1>WhaT you're judging a person when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're running for president.</v>

3543
02:38:20.511 --> 02:38:22.010
<v Speaker 1>You 100 percent judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

3544
02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:22.933
<v Speaker 1>and we do judge massively short in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>department of taking care of his own </v>

3545
02:38:26.721 --> 02:38:28.730
<v Speaker 1>physical being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us,</v>

3546
02:38:28.731 --> 02:38:31.070
<v Speaker 1>and we know that most of us when we hire</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

3547
02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:33.290
<v Speaker 1>if one guys in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy's not,</v>

3548
02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:37.010
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna just instinctly go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make those conclusions.</v>

3549
02:38:37.011 --> 02:38:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And that in a way is fair in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you look at the world where you say,</v>

3550
02:38:41.481 --> 02:38:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't draw your own biology,</v>

3551
02:38:43.611 --> 02:38:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what else you can't control.</v>

3552
02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And as a fat person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3553
02:38:47.121 --> 02:38:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you're walking into that or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to take responsibility for whatever</v>

3554
02:38:50.031 --> 02:38:53.480
<v Speaker 1>the world by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard thing.</v>

3555
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I just don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking lost 10 pounds.</v>

3556
02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't even fat.</v>

3557
02:38:58.430 --> 02:39:00.070
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not different.</v>

3558
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Why is it challenging?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if he's otherwise did still make </v>

3559
02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:08.780
<v Speaker 1>decisions for me than it is for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you how I think some people,</v>

3560
02:39:08.781 --> 02:39:09.614
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a predilection not only to put on </v>

3561
02:39:11.361 --> 02:39:14.330
<v Speaker 1>weight because their endocrine system is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just whacked,</v>

3562
02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:15.433
<v Speaker 1>but also some people do have addictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and addictions are very powerful and </v>

3563
02:39:19.601 --> 02:39:21.240
<v Speaker 1>he's an addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people,</v>

3564
02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my president,</v>

3565
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:26.720
<v Speaker 1>whether it's drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

3566
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:30.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying is that what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is that to just.</v>

3567
02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:31.673
<v Speaker 1>We live in a culture now that just puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much emphasis on the physical and I </v>

3568
02:39:35.331 --> 02:39:36.164
<v Speaker 1>think there are a lot of people who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been overweight and who have eaten too </v>

3569
02:39:39.861 --> 02:39:43.900
<v Speaker 1>much or had a thing for sugar who still </v>
<v Speaker 1>are incredibly,</v>

3570
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.983
<v Speaker 1>incredibly beneficial and to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would finish things and done </v>

3571
02:39:48.501 --> 02:39:50.780
<v Speaker 1>things that you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were just.</v>

3572
02:39:50.810 --> 02:39:53.000
<v Speaker 1>They were huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were huge intellects.</v>

3573
02:39:53.060 --> 02:39:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a different story.</v>

3574
02:39:54.231 --> 02:39:55.064
<v Speaker 1>But they were huge intellects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a lot of smart people that are </v>

3575
02:39:57.081 --> 02:39:58.370
<v Speaker 1>fat for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's.</v>

3576
02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them running the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3577
02:40:01.490 --> 02:40:02.323
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a really smart fat person who's a </v>

3578
02:40:05.601 --> 02:40:08.750
<v Speaker 1>great singer or smart fat person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at telling jokes.</v>

3579
02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:12.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a fucking president.</v>

3580
02:40:12.141 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 1>A president is not just</v>

3581
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.910
<v Speaker 2>a guy who can talk to this guy and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>good decisions.</v>

3582
02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:20.760
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking figurehead for the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States of America.</v>

3583
02:40:20.910 --> 02:40:23.280
<v Speaker 2>The greatest super power the world has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever known.</v>

3584
02:40:23.490 --> 02:40:25.160
<v Speaker 2>For us to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chris christie's,</v>

3585
02:40:25.170 --> 02:40:28.640
<v Speaker 2>the best we could do is a disgrace to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different subjects like you.</v>

3586
02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.850
<v Speaker 2>You have all your bases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to cover all your bases.</v>

3587
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:35.360
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

3588
02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:37.140
<v Speaker 2>You're talking specifically about chris </v>
<v Speaker 2>christie.</v>

3589
02:40:37.141 --> 02:40:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about somebody talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who stomach got.</v>

3591
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I reacted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reacted to.</v>

3592
02:40:45.661 --> 02:40:46.494
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to vote for somebody who </v>

3593
02:40:49.351 --> 02:40:51.460
<v Speaker 2>looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3594
02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and for me,</v>

3595
02:40:52.621 --> 02:40:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't make as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the only one.</v>

3596
02:40:55.490 --> 02:40:56.270
<v Speaker 2>He's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

3597
02:40:56.270 --> 02:40:59.650
<v Speaker 2>You're arguing semantics now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one guy looks like that.</v>

3598
02:40:59.730 --> 02:41:01.920
<v Speaker 2>He's the only guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe trump's not skinny.</v>

3599
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:03.210
<v Speaker 2>He's a fat fuck too.</v>

3600
02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:04.740
<v Speaker 2>If you saw trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was close on.</v>

3601
02:41:04.741 --> 02:41:05.760
<v Speaker 2>You throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3602
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:08.540

02:42:40.410 --> 02:42:42.120
<v Speaker 2>To do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so far.</v>

3636
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:43.600
<v Speaker 2>It's criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's criminal.</v>

3637
02:42:43.630 --> 02:42:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Shut down a bridge to try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk about it.</v>

3638
02:42:47.130 --> 02:42:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get fucking fights.</v>

3639
02:42:51.270 --> 02:42:55.440
<v Speaker 2>So we know the size difference we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their heights.</v>

3640
02:42:56.250 --> 02:42:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I guess it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think taller.</v>

3641
02:42:58.690 --> 02:42:59.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three inches taller and he has a two </v>

3642
02:43:01.321 --> 02:43:03.840
<v Speaker 2>inch reach advantage says to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3643
02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

3644
02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:07.500
<v Speaker 2>That's going to play a big factor </v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously,</v>

3645
02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and moves in so much isn't used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting bigger guy,</v>

3646
02:43:11.651 --> 02:43:13.080
<v Speaker 2>but now he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

3647
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:16.870
<v Speaker 2>if you've seen pictures of the video is </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking huge right now.</v>

3648
02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:19.010
<v Speaker 2>The leg reach thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3649
02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:20.690
<v Speaker 2>he's got longer legs to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3650
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:22.790
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3651
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:24.790
<v Speaker 2>He uses them real well and really well </v>
<v Speaker 2>at distance.</v>

3652
02:43:24.791 --> 02:43:27.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not like me where I just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step in and club your legs.</v>

3653
02:43:27.341 --> 02:43:28.174
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to try to try to negate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap between him and he likes to throw a </v>

3654
02:43:31.691 --> 02:43:36.691
<v Speaker 2>lot of front kicks to the body like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did with Chad and the against the ideas.</v>

3655
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this on creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about uh,</v>

3656
02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:42.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w with connor,</v>

3657
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:44.200
<v Speaker 2>he's always been the bully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3658
02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:45.033
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of bullied the 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 2>division and then now here there's no </v>

3659
02:43:48.011 --> 02:43:48.611
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3660
02:43:48.611 --> 02:43:49.444
<v Speaker 2>he's just not bigger than dia's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's the first time we're </v>

3661
02:43:51.881 --> 02:43:55.540
<v Speaker 2>really going to see him where his size </v>
<v Speaker 2>and can be that advantage anymore.</v>

3662
02:43:55.541 --> 02:43:59.950
<v Speaker 2>But he's pretty goddamn big right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wAs training for fighting at 1:55,</v>

3663
02:43:59.951 --> 02:44:02.140
<v Speaker 2>which means he ate like a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought at 1:55</v>

3664
02:44:02.141 --> 02:44:04.810
<v Speaker 2>and in the uk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's fought at 1:55</v>

3665
02:44:04.811 --> 02:44:05.644
<v Speaker 2>before and starch guys with one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absoluTely believe it's power carries </v>

3666
02:44:09.191 --> 02:44:13.420
<v Speaker 2>over 200 percent to 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this fight is essentially at one 70,</v>

3667
02:44:13.421 --> 02:44:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are one $55 that don't have to cut</v>

3668
02:44:16.001 --> 02:44:17.050
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on.</v>

3669
02:44:17.290 --> 02:44:19.690
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to cut weight because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was part of the agreement.</v>

3670
02:44:19.691 --> 02:44:22.270
<v Speaker 2>When nate took the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took it at a catch weight.</v>

3671
02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3672
02:44:22.770 --> 02:44:27.770
<v Speaker 2>deals was down to go to I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six x five slash 16 congress.</v>

3673
02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:28.331
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>

3674
02:44:28.331 --> 02:44:29.164
<v Speaker 2>I want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to have the advantage here </v>

3675
02:44:30.161 --> 02:44:30.880
<v Speaker 2>and the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3676
02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.920
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make it one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't kill yourself.</v>

3677
02:44:32.930 --> 02:44:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to cut weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

3678
02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3679
02:44:35.921 --> 02:44:36.754
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the future and I really </v>

3680
02:44:37.991 --> 02:44:42.700
<v Speaker 2>truly hope that people decide to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a much more reasonable weight class.</v>

3681
02:44:42.701 --> 02:44:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I think they decided to do this where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they fight,</v>

3682
02:44:44.770 --> 02:44:49.390
<v Speaker 2>where they actually belong and stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dehydration process.</v>

3683
02:44:49.391 --> 02:44:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking madness.</v>

3684
02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:55.060
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst aspect of mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most dangerous aspect of mma.</v>

3685
02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:58.660
<v Speaker 2>The scariest now because there's no ivy </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehydration,</v>

3686
02:44:58.661 --> 02:45:02.590
<v Speaker 2>so these people are going in there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated brains and it taken shots.</v>

3687
02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:04.900
<v Speaker 2>The fucking dome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's stupid.</v>

3688
02:45:04.901 --> 02:45:05.734
<v Speaker 2>It ruins Your chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ruins your ability to fight at the </v>

3689
02:45:07.391 --> 02:45:09.700
<v Speaker 2>best level and lung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Longevity,</v>

3690
02:45:09.701 --> 02:45:11.200
<v Speaker 2>longevity also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3691
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:14.080
<v Speaker 2>The a huge x factor too Is nate diaz.</v>

3692
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:14.501
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3693
02:45:14.501 --> 02:45:17.020
<v Speaker 2>he's getting ready for a trIathlon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

3694
02:45:17.021 --> 02:45:19.480
<v Speaker 2>That's not five rounds of fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ufc.</v>

3695
02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you can make up for that.</v>

3696
02:45:22.330 --> 02:45:23.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because I don't know what </v>

3697
02:45:24.221 --> 02:45:26.470
<v Speaker 2>else he was doing other than training </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the triathlon.</v>

3698
02:45:26.471 --> 02:45:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's doing jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was boxing.</v>

3699
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I know he's definitely training for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>triathlon though,</v>

3700
02:45:31.450 --> 02:45:35.080
<v Speaker 2>which means it's not like you caught him</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the couch doing bong hits and</v>

3701
02:45:35.081 --> 02:45:37.210
<v Speaker 2>eating cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True guys in really good shape,</v>

3702
02:45:37.410 --> 02:45:39.220
<v Speaker 2>different shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a different shape,</v>

3703
02:45:39.221 --> 02:45:40.054
<v Speaker 2>but there's also no wear and tear from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight camp and that can be a big factor </v>

3704
02:45:43.241 --> 02:45:44.230
<v Speaker 2>in his favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3705
02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:45.420
<v Speaker 2>diaz did say he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3706
02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:47.020
<v Speaker 2>to me there's no pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3707
02:45:47.021 --> 02:45:47.740
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

3708
02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I've had cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had full camps.</v>

3709
02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:50.323
<v Speaker 2>I went in there and got my ass whooped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I've had times where I was </v>

3710
02:45:52.421 --> 02:45:54.790
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the couch for three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the gym,</v>

3711
02:45:54.791 --> 02:45:56.230
<v Speaker 2>beat everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3712
02:45:56.231 --> 02:45:57.790
<v Speaker 2>so for me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3713
02:45:57.820 --> 02:45:59.860
<v Speaker 2>it's just another day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a big factor,</v>

3714
02:45:59.890 --> 02:46:02.500
<v Speaker 2>a really big factor is the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to cut weight.</v>

3715
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a big factor for connor to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when we might see the best condom</v>

3716
02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:08.740
<v Speaker 2>we've ever seen because seeing him at </v>
<v Speaker 2>145 pounds,</v>

3717
02:46:08.741 --> 02:46:11.320
<v Speaker 2>that guy was on death's door the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the fight,</v>

3718
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:12.403
<v Speaker 2>the Chad mendez fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked like uttered dog shit at the </v>

3719
02:46:14.871 --> 02:46:15.704
<v Speaker 2>weigh ins and then the next day he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>full and thick and probably 20 plus </v>

3720
02:46:20.091 --> 02:46:24.220
<v Speaker 2>pounds heavier than he was at the wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what gets scary is if diaz</v>

3721
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:26.610
<v Speaker 2>does get mcgregor down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3722
02:46:27.270 --> 02:46:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3723
02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very scary.</v>

3724
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:30.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a high level </v>

3725
02:46:31.131 --> 02:46:35.330
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu with lots of submissions and tse</v>
<v Speaker 2>has got some serious fucking skills from</v>

3726
02:46:35.331 --> 02:46:36.650
<v Speaker 2>top and bottom to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3727
02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

3728
02:46:37.671 --> 02:46:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You just too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see george lockhart has been working</v>

3729
02:46:39.861 --> 02:46:43.140
<v Speaker 2>with george or if conner for the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter too,</v>

3730
02:46:43.540 --> 02:46:47.570
<v Speaker 2>so you know that he's not just eating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of shit.</v>

3731
02:46:47.590 --> 02:46:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's putting mean on a cellular level.</v>

3732
02:46:50.481 --> 02:46:53.180
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's energizing his body With really,</v>

3733
02:46:53.181 --> 02:46:57.800
<v Speaker 2>really good high high energy fuel stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So him putting on that much weight,</v>

3734
02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:01.580
<v Speaker 2>which is just more natural form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be fucking so strong,</v>

3735
02:47:01.581 --> 02:47:02.650
<v Speaker 2>so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such good cars.</v>

3736
02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:04.010
<v Speaker 2>So healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So healthy.</v>

3737
02:47:04.011 --> 02:47:05.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he gets by this,</v>

3738
02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to do ufc 200 if dos </v>
<v Speaker 2>anjos is ready.</v>

3739
02:47:08.410 --> 02:47:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we can inspire them.</v>

3740
02:47:09.470 --> 02:47:12.170
<v Speaker 2>But with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if would have nate diaz lights them up.</v>

3741
02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:13.880
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that happening.</v>

3742
02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Then we don't have to deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit anymore.</v>

3743
02:47:16.770 --> 02:47:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Well we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to deal with this shit though?</v>

3744
02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:22.190
<v Speaker 2>We trust the sport needs that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>

3745
02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the connor shorter ads like</v>

3746
02:47:24.831 --> 02:47:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I want it to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>

3747
02:47:26.901 --> 02:47:27.734
<v Speaker 2>It's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's magical because he is got the guts </v>

3748
02:47:30.561 --> 02:47:35.300
<v Speaker 2>to talk so big and then just to go up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>78 and he's just.</v>

3749
02:47:35.301 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think nate diaz,</v>

3750
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:40.790
<v Speaker 2>if he beats him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he ends the connor train.</v>

3751
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.863
<v Speaker 2>I think he stops it momentarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a regrouping and he comes back </v>

3752
02:47:45.470 --> 02:47:47.050
<v Speaker 2>better than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

3753
02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think losing to nate diaz stops </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3754
02:47:49.791 --> 02:47:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it definitely hits a bump in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>

3755
02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:53.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more of that.</v>

3756
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:54.703
<v Speaker 2>Undefeated or anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at what happened to manny </v>

3757
02:47:56.601 --> 02:47:57.020
<v Speaker 2>pacquiao.</v>

3758
02:47:57.020 --> 02:48:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I fought one male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one male marquez and got knocked dead.</v>

3759
02:48:00.270 --> 02:48:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I planted the same.</v>

3760
02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:03.283
<v Speaker 2>Not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he came back and it's still just as </v>

3761
02:48:05.031 --> 02:48:08.900
<v Speaker 2>huge as he's ever been mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same as floyd though.</v>

3762
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Like floyd was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3763
02:48:10.671 --> 02:48:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Never lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's fights were born.</v>

3764
02:48:12.591 --> 02:48:14.270
<v Speaker 2>We still tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still the best of all time.</v>

3765
02:48:14.271 --> 02:48:16.640
<v Speaker 2>He had like this huge undefeated or </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>

3766
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:19.550
<v Speaker 2>He loses with his fighting style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out.</v>

3767
02:48:19.610 --> 02:48:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he loses,</v>

3768
02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:24.680
<v Speaker 2>he's boring to watch undefeated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's tuned in.</v>

3769
02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:25.533
<v Speaker 2>He also refused to find some guys in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their prime like manny pacquiao five </v>

3770
02:48:28.911 --> 02:48:30.050
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years ago,</v>

3771
02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:31.513
<v Speaker 2>but stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop right there because he had a real </v>

3772
02:48:33.231 --> 02:48:36.350
<v Speaker 2>good argument that manny pacquiao was </v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely on performance.</v>

3773
02:48:36.351 --> 02:48:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Enhance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refused to take the drug test.</v>

3774
02:48:38.061 --> 02:48:38.894
<v Speaker 2>So there's a reason why it moved up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight weight classes kept his knockout </v>

3775
02:48:45.050 --> 02:48:45.950
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3776
02:48:46.100 --> 02:48:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether or not many it did </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

3777
02:48:48.831 --> 02:48:50.960
<v Speaker 2>but that alex a risa guy that was with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

3778
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:52.123
<v Speaker 2>that guy torso notoriously known for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a strength and conditioning </v>

3779
02:48:55.881 --> 02:49:00.881
<v Speaker 2>coach and the reputation is usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually pretty active.</v>

3780
02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Jose conseco in my corner and then be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3781
02:49:04.371 --> 02:49:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 98 pounds.</v>

3782
02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:11.370
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went up eight waist classes and jose</v>

3783
02:49:11.371 --> 02:49:14.820
<v Speaker 1>conseco says fucking best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's good man.</v>

3784
02:49:15.690 --> 02:49:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Strength and conditioning coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys get purple like that.</v>

3785
02:49:18.481 --> 02:49:19.314
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like blood rushing to your </v>

3786
02:49:20.851 --> 02:49:21.684
<v Speaker 1>skin or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get a sweat on flexing and they </v>

3787
02:49:25.521 --> 02:49:27.030
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3788
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Well also I think when you take a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone like that,</v>

3789
02:49:31.441 --> 02:49:33.170
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you developed,</v>

3790
02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:36.030
<v Speaker 1>you have more blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more blood in your system.</v>

3791
02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:37.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this dude I knew who was on like </v>

3792
02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:42.180
<v Speaker 1>heavy dose of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His doctor,</v>

3793
02:49:42.410 --> 02:49:43.243
<v Speaker 1>he was going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing some endurance thing and his </v>

3794
02:49:44.910 --> 02:49:47.430
<v Speaker 1>doctor told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should give blood.</v>

3795
02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:49.830
<v Speaker 1>You should take some blood out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3796
02:49:49.831 --> 02:49:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Before he was going to do some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>bike ride,</v>

3797
02:49:51.930 --> 02:49:54.480
<v Speaker 1>like you should get rid out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

3798
02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:58.450
<v Speaker 1>your blood do thick.</v>

3799
02:49:59.290 --> 02:50:00.123
<v Speaker 1>There's a theory that says that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason women don't die of heart </v>

3800
02:50:03.151 --> 02:50:03.984
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the kind of cholesterol </v>

3801
02:50:04.831 --> 02:50:05.664
<v Speaker 1>issues is because they bleed once a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month and and this guy said if you give </v>

3802
02:50:08.221 --> 02:50:09.054
<v Speaker 1>blood once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be the best thing you can do </v>

3803
02:50:10.321 --> 02:50:11.910
<v Speaker 1>for your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body.</v>

3804
02:50:11.911 --> 02:50:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3805
02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Because apparently it keeps your blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>thInner and so as a result you will.</v>

3806
02:50:17.821 --> 02:50:18.571
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3807
02:50:18.571 --> 02:50:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing this guy,</v>

3808
02:50:20.161 --> 02:50:22.440
<v Speaker 1>so please don't kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play exactly.</v>

3809
02:50:22.441 --> 02:50:23.274
<v Speaker 1>But essentially he said you can lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lipid levels and all this other </v>

3810
02:50:28.081 --> 02:50:30.720
<v Speaker 1>stuff by giving blood once a year and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a huge difference.</v>

3811
02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3812
02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:33.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a school of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been,</v>

3813
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:36.900
<v Speaker 1>it's been disputed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pint,</v>

3814
02:50:36.930 --> 02:50:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been disputed.</v>

3815
02:50:37.921 --> 02:50:38.600
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3816
02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:40.140
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's supposed to be the benefit?</v>

3817
02:50:40.141 --> 02:50:43.080
<v Speaker 1>How's it lower your blood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess apparently you,</v>

3818
02:50:43.081 --> 02:50:45.240
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get thick,</v>

3819
02:50:45.350 --> 02:50:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood gets thick,</v>

3820
02:50:46.471 --> 02:50:47.304
<v Speaker 1>you get an and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of acts as I suppose like </v>

3821
02:50:49.681 --> 02:50:50.514
<v Speaker 1>aspirin would where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood gets into your body to </v>

3822
02:50:52.911 --> 02:50:54.570
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenate and more blood than.</v>

3823
02:50:54.570 --> 02:50:57.690
<v Speaker 1>It was interesting that women don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of heart attacks that men do.</v>

3824
02:50:57.720 --> 02:50:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I always attributed that to stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3825
02:50:59.581 --> 02:51:00.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's estrogen.</v>

3826
02:51:00.410 --> 02:51:01.243
<v Speaker 1>I thought estrogen and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to this coUple oF these </v>

3827
02:51:04.651 --> 02:51:08.730
<v Speaker 1>doCtors that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bleed once a month and that hasn't,</v>

3828
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:11.340
<v Speaker 1>that has an effect because they're evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

3829
02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:12.901
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

3830
02:51:12.901 --> 02:51:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give heart attacks.</v>

3831
02:51:14.490 --> 02:51:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3832
02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.660
<v Speaker 1>But I cut myself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck on it.</v>

3833
02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3834
02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit and that.</v>

3835
02:51:22.110 --> 02:51:23.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't cut yourself on purpose.</v>

3836
02:51:24.210 --> 02:51:25.043
<v Speaker 1>Fall down and scrape myself and suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I thought it would go back into </v>

3837
02:51:27.901 --> 02:51:30.690
<v Speaker 1>my bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give wrong stupid.</v>

3838
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Kinda does kind of just doesn't go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your blood.</v>

3839
02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:35.153
<v Speaker 1>THe nutrients go in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think I want to go do a full </v>

3840
02:51:37.891 --> 02:51:40.740
<v Speaker 1>like screening of vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones,</v>

3841
02:51:40.741 --> 02:51:43.150
<v Speaker 1>everything I've ever done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you done cryotherapy yet?</v>

3842
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3843
02:51:44.851 --> 02:51:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I got into a really cold pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost panicked.</v>

3844
02:51:47.650 --> 02:51:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My asshole heart both were like,</v>

3845
02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:53.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not like an ice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3846
02:51:53.610 --> 02:51:55.890
<v Speaker 1>To me it's the ice baths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stronger,</v>

3847
02:51:55.920 --> 02:51:58.310
<v Speaker 1>stronger for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

3848
02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:02.400
<v Speaker 1>an ice bath is more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I'm iceman hof.</v>

3849
02:52:02.401 --> 02:52:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Wim hoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said like for your,</v>

3850
02:52:04.171 --> 02:52:05.800
<v Speaker 1>like your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>

3851
02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:06.050
<v Speaker 1>your</v>

3852
02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:10.750
<v Speaker 2>resiliency and being able to overcome a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice bath is better.</v>

3853
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:12.960
<v Speaker 2>It's way longer because it's just your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3854
02:52:12.961 --> 02:52:13.794
<v Speaker 2>your porn bags of fucking ice in tHat </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and you get in there and you're </v>

3855
02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:20.230
<v Speaker 2>brutalized for saudi minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people swear by cryo therapy.</v>

3856
02:52:20.231 --> 02:52:21.064
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My last camp I did it four times a week </v>

3857
02:52:22.871 --> 02:52:25.780
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't see much of a difference as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to ice baths,</v>

3858
02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:28.150
<v Speaker 2>so I stopped doing with ice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a.</v>

3859
02:52:28.151 --> 02:52:28.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm like what you felt versus the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti inflammation markers in your blood </v>

3860
02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:37.990
<v Speaker 2>because they've definitely shown that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a there.</v>

3861
02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:41.280
<v Speaker 2>It reduces inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty radically better.</v>

3862
02:52:41.350 --> 02:52:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Better than an ice bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but better because I don't.</v>

3863
02:52:43.961 --> 02:52:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much.</v>

3864
02:52:46.690 --> 02:52:49.630
<v Speaker 2>How much has been shown that a ice bath </v>
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

3865
02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:50.523
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more aware of what they've shown </v>

3866
02:52:51.911 --> 02:52:55.480
<v Speaker 2>from a cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where it's really effective.</v>

3867
02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It's for people with arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is lady that goes to the place that</v>

3868
02:52:58.361 --> 02:53:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I go to and this poor lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her hands are jacked man.</v>

3869
02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:03.520
<v Speaker 2>like her whole life or has it been like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

3870
02:53:03.521 --> 02:53:04.354
<v Speaker 2>Just like snarled up clause and she now </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in a decade can </v>

3871
02:53:09.231 --> 02:53:12.430
<v Speaker 2>straighten her fingers out and she never</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about just filling up buckets of</v>

3872
02:53:12.431 --> 02:53:15.310
<v Speaker 2>ice and put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you should write maybe.</v>

3873
02:53:15.311 --> 02:53:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what she's done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should've asked her.</v>

3874
02:53:17.530 --> 02:53:17.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3875
02:53:17.841 --> 02:53:18.674
<v Speaker 2>it's like my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually partnering up with the </v>

3876
02:53:20.741 --> 02:53:23.950
<v Speaker 2>cryoablation in lake forest or balls </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep opening up march,</v>

3877
02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:24.813
<v Speaker 2>March 15th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We opened up March 15th called therapy </v>

3878
02:53:27.401 --> 02:53:29.530
<v Speaker 2>kraus along lake forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3879
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:31.990
<v Speaker 2>my daughter has juvenile rheumatoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis.</v>

3880
02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I take her in my craft machine or my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lady I used to go to monica newport,</v>

3881
02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:39.050
<v Speaker 2>our custom mesa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3882
02:53:39.880 --> 02:53:43.360
<v Speaker 2>it sparked my interest and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that it fucking works.</v>

3883
02:53:43.540 --> 02:53:45.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the science is behind it.</v>

3884
02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:46.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about how deeply penetrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it penetrates deeper than a ice </v>

3885
02:53:49.781 --> 02:53:52.450
<v Speaker 2>bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've done ice baths my whole life.</v>

3886
02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:55.060
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking way different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>TheY hurt my toes and feet.</v>

3887
02:53:55.061 --> 02:53:58.000
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always like trying to stick them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the pain to.</v>

3888
02:53:58.001 --> 02:54:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Do they Sit in an ice bath typically 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes?</v>

3889
02:54:02.051 --> 02:54:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3890
02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:03.670
<v Speaker 2>In both the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3891
02:54:03.671 --> 02:54:06.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a korean bath asked by my gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>right next,</v>

3892
02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:07.690
<v Speaker 2>right next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So d and I,</v>

3893
02:54:07.710 --> 02:54:09.790
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know this nice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the korean bath house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a little.</v>

3896
02:54:14.490 --> 02:54:18.140
<v Speaker 2>My bedding don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

3897
02:54:19.390 --> 02:54:20.223
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen a small deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen a small thing until </v>

3898
02:54:22.361 --> 02:54:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you've gone to a korean bath houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3899
02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:26.200
<v Speaker 2>will you try and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that racist?</v>

3900
02:54:26.590 --> 02:54:27.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's science.</v>

3901
02:54:27.970 --> 02:54:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Does it smell like kimchi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3902
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:33.550
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of dicks at these places.</v>

3903
02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:37.780
<v Speaker 2>ramen noodles is like japanese isn't the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong race yesterday,</v>

3904
02:54:37.810 --> 02:54:39.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking tiny.</v>

3905
02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:42.820
<v Speaker 2>But before you put your daughter in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cryotherapy chamber,</v>

3906
02:54:42.940 --> 02:54:45.580
<v Speaker 2>did you ever just have her take ice bath</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did it help?</v>

3907
02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put ice on her before,</v>

3908
02:54:47.051 --> 02:54:48.790
<v Speaker 2>but she was two and a half when she got </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed.</v>

3909
02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:51.473
<v Speaker 2>She didn't like ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we're also getting things like </v>

3910
02:54:53.561 --> 02:54:57.660
<v Speaker 2>the hyperbaric chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kNow with her ailment or disease,</v>

3911
02:54:57.860 --> 02:54:58.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she hasn't had a flare up in a long </v>

3912
02:54:59.951 --> 02:55:01.930
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because we feed her the right food.</v>

3913
02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:03.800
<v Speaker 2>She's gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sugar free.</v>

3914
02:55:03.801 --> 02:55:04.430
<v Speaker 2>The hyperbaric</v>

3915
02:55:04.430 --> 02:55:06.140
<v Speaker 4>chamber help where I haven't put it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>one yet.</v>

3916
02:55:06.141 --> 02:55:07.170
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't gotten one yet,</v>

3917
02:55:07.171 --> 02:55:09.410
<v Speaker 4>but I'm getting the adjuStments that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've made in the diet.</v>

3918
02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:10.273
<v Speaker 4>They've had a pretty big impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having a low inflammatory food diet is </v>

3919
02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:17.450
<v Speaker 4>has first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she was running by 10 months,</v>

3920
02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's ahead of the curve,</v>

3921
02:55:19.761 --> 02:55:20.594
<v Speaker 4>really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then to see her not being able to walk </v>

3922
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:25.330
<v Speaker 4>or a little kid having brain fog that </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes with,</v>

3923
02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:28.550
<v Speaker 4>with ra and I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3924
02:55:29.060 --> 02:55:30.830
<v Speaker 4>I was a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3925
02:55:30.890 --> 02:55:31.723
<v Speaker 4>and she can agenda but skew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then finally we started to do all </v>

3926
02:55:33.561 --> 02:55:34.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the food,</v>

3927
02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:37.940
<v Speaker 4>the food has changed and now she's w we </v>
<v Speaker 4>fixed her quickly,</v>

3928
02:55:37.941 --> 02:55:42.020
<v Speaker 4>we got on it right away and she's okay </v>
<v Speaker 4>now she's good days.</v>

3929
02:55:42.021 --> 02:55:43.950
<v Speaker 4>And you wouldn't notice it or you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have no idea.</v>

3930
02:55:44.830 --> 02:55:48.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean there'S no more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was limping a bit with sad,</v>

3931
02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:52.760
<v Speaker 4>funny I guess whatever she got diagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I tore my hip.</v>

3932
02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:53.833
<v Speaker 4>So we're botH limping around the house </v>
<v Speaker 4>and limping around disneyland and </v>

3933
02:55:56.301 --> 02:55:57.134
<v Speaker 4>limping around everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it maybe kind of made her </v>

3934
02:55:58.731 --> 02:56:00.410
<v Speaker 4>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

3935
02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:03.350
<v Speaker 3>what did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you dairy free,</v>

3936
02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:05.180
<v Speaker 3>gluten free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>processed sugar,</v>

3937
02:56:05.181 --> 02:56:06.014
<v Speaker 3>free processed sugar free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long did it take before he saw </v>

3938
02:56:08.271 --> 02:56:09.104
<v Speaker 3>an impact?</v>

3939
02:56:09.930 --> 02:56:10.763
<v Speaker 4>Not long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took maybe a montH or two and then </v>

3940
02:56:14.011 --> 02:56:16.350
<v Speaker 4>after six months fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean six months.</v>

3941
02:56:16.351 --> 02:56:20.930
<v Speaker 4>It was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After a year it was gigantic.</v>

3942
02:56:20.931 --> 02:56:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Now what else you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3943
02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:23.190
<v Speaker 4>Do you give her?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any supplements,</v>

02:56:23.191 --> 02:56:25.620
<v Speaker 4>fish oil or anything along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I'm so harsh on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that chris christie guys,</v>

3973
02:57:33.481 --> 02:57:34.314
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want anybody that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>representative of the unIted states or </v>

3974
02:57:38.010 --> 02:57:42.240
<v Speaker 3>us or a leader that shows the populist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which shows this,</v>

3975
02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:45.660
<v Speaker 3>this willingness to give it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that to them to be exceptional.</v>

3976
02:57:45.661 --> 02:57:47.840
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be super girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly superhero.</v>

3977
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:48.743
<v Speaker 3>That's having some discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that there's some severe </v>

3978
02:57:52.711 --> 02:57:53.544
<v Speaker 3>consequences to not having that </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline and when you're a massively </v>

3979
02:57:57.091 --> 02:57:59.970
<v Speaker 3>overweight guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of aches and pains.</v>

3980
02:57:59.980 --> 02:58:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Our whole motto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3981
02:58:01.471 --> 02:58:05.400
<v Speaker 3>So when kids look up to and they see </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fat ass being the leader and like,</v>

3982
02:58:05.401 --> 02:58:06.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3983
02:58:06.690 --> 02:58:07.523
<v Speaker 3>it's just amazing that a young girl who </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed this horrible ailment can get </v>

3984
02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:16.890
<v Speaker 3>relieF so quickly just by adjusting your</v>
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>

3985
02:58:16.890 --> 02:58:18.780
<v Speaker 3>It makes me never want to eat that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

3986
02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:19.823
<v Speaker 3>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me want to cut all that stuff </v>

3987
02:58:21.421 --> 02:58:23.130
<v Speaker 3>out of my life forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I mArried,</v>

3988
02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:25.950
<v Speaker 3>if americans learned how to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have like one of the biggest</v>

3989
02:58:25.951 --> 02:58:28.080
<v Speaker 3>issues is always like healthcare and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

3990
02:58:28.100 --> 02:58:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how many ailments would not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a factor if people ate better.</v>

3991
02:58:33.090 --> 02:58:33.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3992
02:58:33.541 --> 02:58:38.541
<v Speaker 3>I watched this documentary with my kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>on corn syrup are on syrup and sugar.</v>

3993
02:58:38.911 --> 02:58:39.720
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

3994
02:58:39.720 --> 02:58:40.553
<v Speaker 3>it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called that sugar </v>

3995
02:58:41.161 --> 02:58:41.994
<v Speaker 3>documentary and we went through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarket and you start grabbing </v>

3996
02:58:45.511 --> 02:58:48.750
<v Speaker 3>things and looking at how much sugar is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in everything subsidized for everything.</v>

3997
02:58:48.810 --> 02:58:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in everything</v>

3998
02:58:51.150 --> 02:58:54.960
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so deeply ingrained in everything.</v>

3999
02:58:54.961 --> 02:58:56.070
<v Speaker 4>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything we eat,</v>

4000
02:58:56.340 --> 02:58:57.061
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>

4001
02:58:57.061 --> 02:58:57.700
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar.</v>

4002
02:58:57.700 --> 02:58:59.580
<v Speaker 4>It's know fed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That other document you're talking about</v>

4003
02:58:59.610 --> 02:59:01.500
<v Speaker 4>that they point out so many good points.</v>

4004
02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:03.980
<v Speaker 3>That sounded weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

4005
02:59:04.690 --> 02:59:05.940
<v Speaker 4>it all makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

4006
02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:10.480
<v Speaker 4>You can turn around anything and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking sugar in it and everything is so</v>

4007
02:59:10.481 --> 02:59:12.340
<v Speaker 4>manipulative time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys had fast food.</v>

4008
02:59:14.140 --> 02:59:14.973
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had anything anywhere near it </v>

4009
02:59:16.610 --> 02:59:19.040
<v Speaker 3>in a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I started this diet.</v>

4010
02:59:19.041 --> 02:59:21.050
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started I had to go back and look at the</v>

4011
02:59:21.051 --> 02:59:21.884
<v Speaker 3>clock or the calendar rather february.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First was the first day that I started </v>

4012
02:59:24.771 --> 02:59:26.870
<v Speaker 3>the diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you have fast food before that knit?</v>

4015
02:59:30.470 --> 02:59:33.590
<v Speaker 3>and I decided after I ate that that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be the last.</v>

4016
02:59:33.810 --> 02:59:35.690
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be my last blow out </v>
<v Speaker 3>meals.</v>

4017
02:59:35.691 --> 02:59:36.524
<v Speaker 3>I had to pastrami sandwiches at a reuben</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a corned beef sandwich was </v>

4018
02:59:41.121 --> 02:59:43.190
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't miss the.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I could eat it,</v>

4021
02:59:47.480 --> 02:59:48.313
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The benefits are for a little bit of </v>

4022
02:59:51.051 --> 02:59:51.884
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pleasure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what I like.</v>

4031
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:11.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what I crave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy that.</v>

4032
03:00:11.721 --> 03:00:12.554
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite kind of meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did it get you to take out </v>

4033
03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:17.090
<v Speaker 3>carbs for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felt like that dude.</v>

4034
03:00:17.091 --> 03:00:17.871
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4035
03:00:17.871 --> 03:00:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I got a headache the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

4036
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:21.220
<v Speaker 3>That was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4037
03:00:21.460 --> 03:00:24.410
<v Speaker 3>where my body was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to use the word detoxing.</v>

4038
03:00:24.470 --> 03:00:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Withdrawals going through detoxing man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks to me,</v>

4039
03:00:27.801 --> 03:00:30.620
<v Speaker 3>but that's what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was sugar,</v>

4040
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:33.620
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sugar I think was the headache thing</v>

4041
03:00:33.770 --> 03:00:35.870
<v Speaker 3>because I'd cut out sugar before and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a headache.</v>

4042
03:00:36.350 --> 03:00:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you drink on this at all?</v>

4043
03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:42.110
<v Speaker 3>They can have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't been.</v>

4044
03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:44.060
<v Speaker 3>You were tried cutting out caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coffee?</v>

4045
03:00:44.570 --> 03:00:47.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to slas.</v>

4046
03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:52.820
<v Speaker 3>SHivering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love when I write,</v>

4047
03:00:53.180 --> 03:00:54.790
<v Speaker 3>when I write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really sit down.</v>

4048
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:57.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to finish something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drink wAy too much.</v>

4049
03:00:57.411 --> 03:01:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Graphene and I took some time off after </v>
<v Speaker 3>last time I did,</v>

4050
03:01:01.571 --> 03:01:02.404
<v Speaker 3>it was a long time ago and last time I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went on like a real binge where I was </v>

4051
03:01:07.301 --> 03:01:10.480
<v Speaker 3>just drinking coffee all day everyday </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like a month.</v>

4052
03:01:10.481 --> 03:01:11.314
<v Speaker 3>That Would be today and then I went like</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one or two days off in my head was </v>

4053
03:01:15.191 --> 03:01:16.630
<v Speaker 3>killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>

4054
03:01:16.750 --> 03:01:18.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in a vice.</v>

4055
03:01:18.970 --> 03:01:20.120
<v Speaker 3>That was worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mom,</v>

4056
03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:22.570
<v Speaker 3>it was probably like right up there with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugar thing.</v>

4057
03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:26.120
<v Speaker 3>The sugar thing was like for three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two or three days I was fogged.</v>

4058
03:01:26.130 --> 03:01:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Sugar would be a big hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one.</v>

4059
03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Here's another big hurdle when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>convert from your body,</v>

4060
03:01:32.470 --> 03:01:33.303
<v Speaker 3>eating mostly carbs and using that for </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuel to trying to go into ketosis and </v>

4061
03:01:39.191 --> 03:01:42.400
<v Speaker 3>burn fat for fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like a bitch like your week?</v>

4062
03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:45.070
<v Speaker 3>Like when I go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm lifting weights,</v>

4063
03:01:45.071 --> 03:01:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to push like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4064
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:48.940
<v Speaker 3>you still feel that way or he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know gone.</v>

4065
03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:50.040
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked out today.</v>

4066
03:01:50.041 --> 03:01:52.330
<v Speaker 3>I felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the push part,</v>

4067
03:01:52.750 --> 03:01:53.583
<v Speaker 3>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's hard to get through things so </v>

4068
03:01:55.971 --> 03:01:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I can decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have discipline.</v>

4069
03:01:58.001 --> 03:01:59.200
<v Speaker 3>This is what you gotta do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4070
03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:00.213
<v Speaker 3>You got to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't write this down because I mean </v>

4071
03:02:01.810 --> 03:02:03.570
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wasn't going to cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>

4072
03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:04.413
<v Speaker 3>this is how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm going to do this I'm </v>

4073
03:02:05.711 --> 03:02:08.230
<v Speaker 3>doing and so I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't,</v>

4074
03:02:08.470 --> 03:02:11.800
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have that mindset or you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not used to doing that kind of thing,</v>

4075
03:02:12.010 --> 03:02:12.880
<v Speaker 3>just write it down.</v>

4076
03:02:13.090 --> 03:02:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Write down what you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

4077
03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to eat sugar.</v>

4078
03:02:16.030 --> 03:02:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to eat carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

4079
03:02:17.230 --> 03:02:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Eat that and write that down every </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn day and then check it off at the</v>

4080
03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:22.690
<v Speaker 3>end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That way you know you did it.</v>

4081
03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:27.340
<v Speaker 3>If you just leave it to like the ether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just put it out there and just,</v>

4082
03:02:27.350 --> 03:02:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

03:02:27.950 --> 03:02:30.610
<v Speaker 3>y'all wishy washy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be disciplined.</v>

4084
03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:32.650
<v Speaker 3>You just know it's so.</v>
