00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>The Great Wall of China was built to keep the Mongols out.</v>

13
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

14

<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

16
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I just got back from China on Monday.</v>

17
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I went to the Great Wall like two weeks ago,</v>

18
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>but the first time I went to the Great Wall was about 12 years ago.</v>

19
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>there's Mongolian people hang out on the top,</v>

22
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>just a few of them that are like selling things like woman selling postcards and</v>

23
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.754
<v Speaker 1>cheap stuff.</v>

24
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

25
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I bought some postcards.</v>

26
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.211
<v Speaker 1>It was like a dollar.</v>

27
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I gave the woman a 10.</v>

28
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't give me the change.</v>

29
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.541
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And what's in that video also is the greatest thing.</v>

96
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>As great as the Great Wall is,</v>

97
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>there is a Toboggan slide that you'd go down.</v>

98
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.093
<v Speaker 1>It's a little,</v>

99
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.521
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>

100
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Sit on like a little luge plastic thing and you've got to stick between your</v>

101
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>legs and you push it forward to go fast and pull it back to slow down and it's</v>

102
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>windy and it's got some huge drops in it.</v>

103
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.111
<v Speaker 1>And I went there.</v>

104
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:07.771
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

105
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:08.011
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

106
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>There's three,</v>

107
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>there's three sections.</v>

108
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>This tourists can go to the Great Wall and there's only the one section that has</v>

109
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>this fantastic,</v>

110
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>magnificent slide,</v>

111
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's thrilling.</v>

113
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And then you get down to the bottom and there's a big,</v>

114
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>it's on that Beijing video.</v>

115
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I filmed it while I did it.</v>

116
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I just did it again a few weeks ago and at the bottom,</v>

117
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>

119
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:29.394
<v Speaker 1>it is exactly.</v>

120
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

121
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>there's some Chinese soldier,</v>

122
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>communist guys with like military jackets on down at the bottom on these big</v>

123
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>turns going slow down,</v>

124
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 1>slow down or move because obviously they've had a few people like fly all flip</v>

125
00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>off the corners.</v>

126
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.793
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

127
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.183
<v Speaker 1>And you good.</v>

128
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>How are you slowing down?</v>

129
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>How do you slow it down?</v>

130
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.641
<v Speaker 1>What you just,</v>

131
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you pull the stick towards you.</v>

132
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

133
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

134
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't see that was in winter when I first went,</v>

135
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but I just did it again,</v>

136
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:56.251
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

137
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

138
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

139
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go right back up to the top.</v>

140
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.191
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

141
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.024
<v Speaker 1>It's a Great Wall is,</v>

142
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that slide is even cooler and that's so avoid the Mongols at the top.</v>

143
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the Mongol footage.</v>

144
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that broader thing.</v>

145
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>The only manmade structure,</v>

146
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand that you can see fairly.</v>

147
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That's horse shit.</v>

148
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I said that to where it is.</v>

149
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.734
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

150
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.540

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

248
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

249
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.990
<v Speaker 1>So I was just in Hong Kong a few weeks ago and uh,</v>

250
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I remembered this story of something that happened to me the very first time I</v>

251
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.340
<v Speaker 1>went to Hong Kong was like 12 years ago.</v>

252
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'd never been to Hong Kong and China and I was really excited.</v>

253
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.294
<v Speaker 1>And one of the it,</v>

254
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I was staying at the Shangri la hotel,</v>

255
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.460
<v Speaker 1>the most opulent,</v>

256
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:53.121
<v Speaker 1>fancy,</v>

257
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.340
<v Speaker 1>luxurious hotel I've ever been in my life.</v>

258
00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:56.174
<v Speaker 1>I mean above,</v>

259
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>beyond Fivestars,</v>

260
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>just swank.</v>

261
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And so the first day I just walked and walked and I'm wanting to soak a as much</v>

262
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>of Hong Kong and my eyeballs.</v>

263
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I could and just see the city and I'm walking around.</v>

264
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And when I got back to my hotel room at the end of the day,</v>

265
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>they had put a goldfish in a little goldfish bowl on my desk and it had a note</v>

266
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.513
<v Speaker 1>and it said,</v>

267
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>traveling is sacred,</v>

268
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but no one deserves to be alone.</v>

269
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why we've provided the goldfish.</v>

270
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome to be your friend and keep you company during your stay here.</v>

271
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.133
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

272
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>So two nights later,</v>
