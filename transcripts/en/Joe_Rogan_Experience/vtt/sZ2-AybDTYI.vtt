00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.300
Well,
hey everybody,

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.510
what the fuck is going on in internet land?

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.950
My friends today,
it's going to be a lot of fun.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.820
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.410
o,
n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain,
shroom,
tech,

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.100
sport and shroom,
tech,
immune and new mood.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.560
We got some supplements for your brain,
son.
If you're interested in nootropics,

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.570
in all seriousness,
that's what Alpha brain is.

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:35.571
It's a blend of nutrients that are supposed to enhance your brain's ability to

10
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.060
produce neurotransmitters.
They make you essentially,

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.270
they make you a little bit smarter.
Does it work?
Yeah,
it works.
Yeah.
There's,
I've,

12
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:47.271
I've been experimenting with nootropics and so as a young man and,

13
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.640
uh,
there's,
there's a,
there's been a lot of,
um,

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.560
different formulas that have come out like a,

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.270
there's a guy named Bill Roman house.
You,
no,

16
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.860
we as a former football player get,
uh,
get right up in the [inaudible] before.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.580
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
he,
uh,
he suffered a lot of concussions.

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.710
This is where I found out about it.
He suffered a lot of concussions and he um,

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.840
started taking different nutrients that are designed to sort of stimulate your

20
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:15.420
brain function and he created his own sort of blend of him and it's called neuro

21
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:17.910
one.
And that's how I got into nootropics from his stuff.

22
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
Have you ever seen them make like a really stupid motherfucker,
I can't do this,

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.810
can't do that.
You know what it does is it,
it,

24
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.100
it honestly for me it feels like things like things come a little smoother,

25
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.590
if that makes any sense.
It's like there's,

26
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.100
I know there's levels of brain function and you,
so you've got to figure out,

27
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.010
well what is that?
What is it?
What are the,
what are the levels of brain function?

28
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:41.880
What is it?
When I wake up in the morning and I just feel like I fucking dummy,

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.120
my brain is foggy.
I don't know what's going on.

30
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.090
Like if I do an interview at like eight o'clock in the morning,

31
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.830
I sound like a fucking idiot.
It takes me a while to like get that brain cooking.

32
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.450
So these more for like powers of retention,

33
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:57.270
then things that are already in your mind.

34
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.170
So your memory's just quick on something like that.
It's,

35
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.080
I have no idea if they say that people retain everything are usually a huge

36
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.110
amount of what they see every day.
And that is just subconscious.

37
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.530
So maybe what these things are doing or maybe what they're starting to be able

38
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:14.880
to do is to pull those memories straight forward because we have so much

39
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.990
information in our mind.
I don't know anyone that's,
that's a huge stretch.

40
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.700
I don't know.
You'd have to be a scientist to even with that.

41
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.350
I think what it is is,
you know,
there's,

42
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.580
how long have you been to these Alpha brain?

43
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.720
I think that we'd been out for like two years now.
That's what I'm saying.

44
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.740
We're at the very,
very beginning of something like this then.
Well,
uh,

45
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:38.640
there's a been a bunch of different studies on all sorts of different nootropics

46
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390
and uh,
some really positive results are starting to come back.
There's,
um,

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.120
a new additive that we put into Alpha brain.

48
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.740
I don't even know the name of the new shit.

49
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.800
If you're interested in any of this stuff,
go to [inaudible] dot com it's o,
n,
n,

50
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:51.930
I t and all.
It's all explained in detail,

51
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.900
but whatever this new shit that we just put into Alpha brain,

52
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.800
that's the technical term for it.
It,
uh,
has been shown to improve golfers.

53
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.100
I don't know all of these

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 1>different things that they do.
Is it just if every it has everything firing on,</v>

55
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.870
uh,
like,
like all the right points?
You know what I mean?

56
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.600
If it makes me feel like the difference between when I take and I don't take it

57
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.970
is sort of like the difference between not having a cup of coffee and having a

58
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.990
cup of coffee,
but not really because it's not like an addictive feeling.

59
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.430
It's not like a,
um,

60
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.690
like if I don't like I get really excited about having coffee,

61
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:27.840
I can't wait to have it and then I get it,
I'm like,
oh,

62
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.500
it's like a little fixed for me.
It's probably not good for you.
Yeah.
I mean it's,

63
00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:36.280
it's,
I mean,
it's definitely this p they say it's okay if you drink a cup of day,

64
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.030
but really why is it okay if you drink a cup of tea?
I mean,

65
00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.950
why is it okay to take a certain amount of stimulants?
I mean,
is it really,

66
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.070
you know,
I'm not really sure,
but it's not much of anything makes you an addict,

67
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.410
but the Alpha brain doesn't make you feel stupid when it's over.

68
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.880
It's not like you have an app and then as it down just gets everything loose.

69
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.030
It's a fascinating subject and there's a lot of controversy,

70
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.110
but there's a lot of studies and a lot of very promising studies and we're a,

71
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.950
we're going to do our own.
Eventually we're just formulating the final,

72
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.850
the final,
a formulation of the,
uh,
of the blend.

73
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.840
And the most recent one is the one that I liked the best.
And um,

74
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.870
it's hard to tell the difference.
So to be honest with you,
it's like,

75
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.780
maybe I'm just eating better now too.

76
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.010
There's a lot of different things that come into factor when it comes to the way

77
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.160
your brain works.
And that's something that everybody needs to consider.
You know,

78
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.040
if you really want those and then you on Meth as nothing else.
Yeah,

79
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.400
it's not going to help you.
I think the most important thing that any,
any,

80
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.010
anybody could ever emphasize is it take care of your,
your body,

81
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:37.390
take care of your meat vessel,

82
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.670
take care of this thing that's taking you through life.

83
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.140
Don't fuck with it too much man.
You know?
I mean,

84
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.900
you should be careful with what you eat.

85
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.770
If you eat sugar every day and crap every day and you're fucking with your body

86
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.060
man,
you're fucking with that thing.

87
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.580
You just given it so you're not getting what it needs and it's going to have

88
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:53.860
some misfires and it's going to have some malfunction.

89
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.410
<v 2>And then you need to realize that,</v>

90
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.090
that the age old saying once a man twice a baby,

91
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.110
you know what I mean?
And what does that mean?
Even our,

92
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.940
sure you come into this world,
you know,
naked,
defenseless,

93
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.670
and when you see very elderly people,

94
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.670
and I think this gives me a great respect for all that they've been through in

95
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:15.300
life.
A lot of times they need help or they can't move or something like that and

96
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.450
they're dependent on somebody else to take care of them.
And that,

97
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.710
that seeing that vision is supposed to inspire like humility and people to be

98
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:26.580
like,
Yo,
you know what?
Oh Man.
Instead of you see people honking their horn,

99
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.820
like walk faster so I can get to nowhere.
You know what I'm saying?

100
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:33.870
People honking horns at old people in New York.
Crazy.
They're out of control,
man.

101
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:36.600
I mean everybody,
I'm from New York where people are in a rush to go nowhere.

102
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.950
You're,

103
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.730
you're rushing from work to get back home to let cable TV wash over you and do

104
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:45.540
nothing.
Well,
it's because the idea of New York's ridiculous.

105
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.600
What a silly idea packed out how many motherfuckers,
you know,

106
00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:51.970
one small let that ride from a Boston dude,
man.
But I,
I,

107
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.230
I'm telling you right now,
I'm sort of a Boston do,

108
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.190
but I was born in,
so I'm more

109
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.150
<v 1>of a,
it's even more fun.</v>

110
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.850
<v 2>Ravelry it's cold.
It just seems crazy.</v>

111
00:06:02.851 --> 00:06:05.150
It's a crazy idea to stuff that many people that,

112
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.860
you know what I thought about the exact same day I went to uh,

113
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.450
to do a tour in Australia and New Zealand and I came home and it just dawned on

114
00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:14.940
me like,
I'm,
people think,
oh,
you're so smart.
Tech man car,

115
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.090
you'd think about somebody read all this stuff.
I came home and it dawned on me,

116
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.691
damn,

117
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:23.691
a human being's natural habitat is not a square of concrete and steel.

118
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:29.340
Like this is not healthy.
You go around in New York,
you see trees in cages.

119
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.030
They're like,
oh,
there's the park.
I was like,
yeah,
good.
A reservation for trees.

120
00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:35.550
You know what I mean?
Without that,
there wouldn't be no oxygen in the city.

121
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.330
It's a weird energy that you get from only people and the things that people

122
00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.400
have created.
It's like an artificial world,

123
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:45.180
like a completely different construct.
It's a city state.
It's a weird place.

124
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.460
I love it,
man.
I bet you do.
I,
you know I'm still there.
There.

125
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.560
<v 1>No,
you don't.
Some people love that shit.
My manager loves it.</v>

126
00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:55.110
He wouldn't live anywhere else.
Anyway,

127
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.500
I'm going to [inaudible] dot com to check out if you're interested in interested

128
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.230
in any new tropics,
I just suggest you Google the subject.

129
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.520
There's a lot of controversy.
There's a lot of uh,

130
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.260
unsubstantiated claims,

131
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.460
but there's a lot of real good research that points to the fact that different

132
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:15.510
nutrients can improve mental function and we've combined the best,

133
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.220
the best formulation that we know how to make.
And uh,

134
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.270
if you're interested in it and you try it,

135
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.600
there's a 100% money back guarantee for the first 30 pills.

136
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.720
So if you try it and you don't like it,
you don't feel it,

137
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.240
you get your money back.
You don't even have to send in the product.

138
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:35.160
We were much more concerned with people not feeling ripped off than we are with

139
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:37.710
making money.
I just know that you're going to enjoy it.

140
00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:41.580
It's the Shit I turned all my friends onto it.

141
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.640
Not One of them is not an Alpha brain head.

142
00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:48.990
Now it's this shit that sounds terrible and Alpha brain.
That's so douchey.

143
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.550
Come apologize.
I apologize.
Yeah,
it comes to the pill.
Don't snort it.
You freaks.

144
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.200
<v 2>I was just going to say after the show,
me and Joe and crushed that shit up.</v>

145
00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:59.750
Rolling the L.
Yeah,
that's the seat.
What if that was the secret?

146
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:02.840
The whole time I've got this Alpha brain and the,
I didn't even know about it.

147
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:04.940
That you're suspicious of snort it.
Yeah.

148
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.560
<v 1>Snoring it.
You're better off.
Um,</v>

149
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.440
we also have a kettle bells and battle ropes in now.

150
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.340
I did my first battle work battle a rope work today.

151
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.470
That things crazy.
It's really weird.
Yeah,
I'll do it.
I will,
we'll uh,

152
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:21.860
we're gonna make some videos too because people keep asking the different

153
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:24.000
exercises.
What kettlebells are is,
um,

154
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.530
it's an ancient Russian form of strength training.

155
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.230
It's like a cannon ball attached to the handle.

156
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.800
It's the most manly shit you could ever be involved with in your life.
Okay.

157
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.370
There's swinging around a fucking cannon ball and if it comes to working out,

158
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:41.490
it's like for me,
I think it's the best strength training work that a,

159
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.090
you could do when it comes to like real world application.

160
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.820
Like your ability to like,
like the,

161
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.000
the strength that really comes up in the real world.
It's like dead lifts,

162
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:54.980
strength and squat strength and bench press trank that's like real world,

163
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:55.981
you know?

164
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:59.250
But there's a lot of people out there like doing curls and tricep extension,

165
00:08:59.251 --> 00:08:59.380
right.

166
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.400
<v 2>Never going to be like sitting trying to push.
It's kind of silly.</v>

167
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.110
I mean the Russian fashion weights,

168
00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:08.530
I know it dude that used to do nothing but those,
yeah.
He was like,
look,

169
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.590
if I'm lifting something like this,
yeah.

170
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.720
This is like if all I do is this and that there's no power in my arm to pull

171
00:09:16.151 --> 00:09:20.230
something up like this.
And I've been doing this with 40 pound weights for years.

172
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:23.830
Like it definitely gave him a different type of strength than I've seen other

173
00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:27.900
people,
I think more centered in the body that I didn't,
you know,

174
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.720
<v 1>it's true.
I mean,
well it gives you a lot,
but it certainly strengthens your core,</v>

175
00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:34.940
which is like one of those words that people like to use a lot.

176
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.490
You've got to work on your core strength,
your core,
you know,

177
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.050
it becomes some sort of a weird sort of a classification for exercise.

178
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.580
But what's important is the whole thing has to work.

179
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.270
Everything has to work and sometimes do to fuck up and they developed like big

180
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:54.210
arms and shit and a big chest,
but their legs don't work that good or you know,

181
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:57.110
they,
you know,
they don't have good lower back strength cause they're,

182
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.650
they're doing silly exercises.
They're not,
they're not bouncing out their body.

183
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.420
And the best thing about Kettlebell exercises you can do with just one of these

184
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.160
cannonballs.
You can literally the workout,
every muscle in your body and you,

185
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.940
it's the kind of workout that you get.

186
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.750
The only thing that's as exhausting is doing Jujitsu.
To me,

187
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.990
that's the only thing that gets me is tired,
is actually sparring and training.

188
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.600
It's,
it's such a brutal workout.

189
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:24.950
There's a great DVD to fall called extreme kettlebell cardio workout that dragon

190
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:25.970
door carries.

191
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.650
If you can get through this motherfucker's workout with a 35 pound kettle bell,

192
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.880
you're an animal and that sounds like nothing.
It's like,
what a 35 pound dude,

193
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:38.900
40 minutes into this thing you were ready to die.
It's incredible.

194
00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:41.870
How tired again,
check it out.
It's the shit.
Anyway,

195
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:44.480
go to [inaudible] dot com and check it out.
If you use a code name Brogan,

196
00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:47.600
you could save 10% off supplements.
But we,
uh,

197
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.780
we literally can't sell kettlebells any cheaper than we're sending them.
We're,

198
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.460
we're basically sending cannon balls in the mail.

199
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.840
It's fucking ridiculous.
It's,
it's hard to get a maid.
They're,
they're,

200
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.440
they're made by Troy and they're the best kettle bells that we could buy.
We,
we,

201
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.070
you know,

202
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.970
we've found the best shit and we're selling it for the best price that we can.

203
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.780
These things though are bulletproof.
They will last forever.

204
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.200
They will find them after the Armageddon and there'll be at the bottom of the,

205
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.450
the new ocean and they'll go,

206
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:20.900
what does this fucking cannon ball with a handle on it.
So you buy them.

207
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:23.180
Once you got them for life and literally you,

208
00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:25.400
you might not ever need to go to a gym again.

209
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:28.310
You can do almost anything except Chin ups,
you know?

210
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:30.680
That's the only thing that I would say.
It's a between Chin ups,

211
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:33.170
body weight squats,
and a couple of kettle bells.

212
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:37.460
That's like all the equipment you ever need go to on a dotcom.
Check it all out.

213
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:39.110
You dirty for probably good for murder

214
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.750
<v 2>or also you could probably kill somebody with him.
She could probably</v>

215
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.410
just that as a weapon.
You could use it as a weapon.
Keep it by your bed.

216
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:54.140
If somebody breaks in,
Brian,
you can use sex as a weapon.
So Julissa,

217
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.010
<v 3>pap editor,
you know,
I imagine that I'm somebody breaks and listen.</v>

218
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:59.290
If you don't leave my house right now,
I'm going to fuck you.
Yeah.

219
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.860
I'm going to shoot you in the legs and I'm going to fuck you afterwards.

220
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.290
That's really got to scare the shit of daddy body though.
Yeah,

221
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.860
that would be not what you expect to hear.
You could totally throw somebody off.

222
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.350
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,

225
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.870

227
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.840
<v 4>Oh</v>

228
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.780
my truth is the all [inaudible] Ethiopia,
Ethiopian,

229
00:12:57.781 --> 00:13:01.240
the want you to fuck with a Minneapolis Somali,
you know when I go home,

230
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:04.390
the world I used to know was going in Napa live on my own for what shall it,

231
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:05.201
profit or wrapper.

232
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.520
We creative control to sign a deal with the devil and who was his sole Musto

233
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.340
Porn?
First expression is cold like the faces,

234
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:13.190
the slave map just on the paper folds.

235
00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:17.170
It's a blip and no racial supremacy quick like the bedtime stories.

236
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.890
Joseph Smith got it for me.
Plot to murder my seeds,

237
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:24.760
a shorty put them in the now in a basket of reason.
That was Dave to the future.

238
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:28.690
What is triggered to flashlight wondering who to fuck with me in a past life,

239
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.300
bad diet or die young,
fast life.

240
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:35.110
Same as a credit flight that took off with the music God on your last night and

241
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:39.570
some of the truth and they caught you a trader.
Honestly,
any code you will hate.

242
00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:40.930
Hater moves the mock composure

243
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.470
<v 3>messages are looking at it as bad as you want to hear the whole.
Yeah.</v>

244
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.440
<v 4>Or pick somewhere we can deep into cross their wings against the head that the</v>

245
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.830
reason that he did with nothing left to believe and even a reason for living

246
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:57.460
that was forgiven by God and not religion with them from the tent like hoarders

247
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.640
tend the Baptist church,

248
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.950
the chicken off the rigor mortis supporters should be illegal instead of the

249
00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:06.480
people that were you here before the Bible.
The more I speak to the detached,

250
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:08.830
an unrealistic that before,
normally

251
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.650
we resisted the whole insecurities Michigan because I didn't know what they

252
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:15.930
really get fishing.
Hi.
Hi.

253
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.973
Hi.

254
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.673
Hi.

255
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.160
<v 3>First of all,
how bad ass is that lyric?
I am the eye,
the sky looking</v>

256
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.090
<v 0>at you.
I can read your mind.
You need to,</v>

257
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.460
you need an acre of rules dealing with fools.
I can cheat you blind.

258
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:00.440
Have you done like an extended version of that song?

259
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.540
Because that song is like crack like I want,

260
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.210
I could hear like that for two more times.

261
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.810
Big shout out to my brother's Sao Paulo who's responsible for producing that.

262
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.450

I just gave you the mater.
It's free.
Like,

263
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.690
I had so many other things in this world.
Some people think that nothing's free,

264
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:18.830
but that actually is free.

265
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:23.831
You can go to viper records.com and you don't have to fill out a stupid survey.

266
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.030
You don't have to sit through a 15 second vivo commercial press one button and

267
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:32.000
then nine minutes later you have a 16 track album.

268
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:35.210
Absolutely free by mortal technique feature and a lot of hip hop,

Vinnie paths,

Diaboliques swaves of a kid.

271
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.240
I mean,
I could just go on dead Prez and you decided to release it free.

272
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.540
Absolutely.
For free.

278
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:19.010
You know what I mean?
That's a,
that's a pretty impressive man.
I appreciate that.

279
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.580
Thank you.
That's awesome.
That's bad ass.
So,
uh,
the,
the name of it again,

280
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.500
one more time for people who are listening,
the martyr,

281
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:29.530
the martyr viper records.com VIP are records.com what made you decide to put it

282
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:32.600
out for free?
Well,

283
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:37.280
I mean it was at a time when I saw that people were struggling financially,

284
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:39.530
economically and I thought to myself,
listen,

285
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:43.820
what's more revolutionary as opposed to being an artist that just has stuff

286
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:47.330
ghost written for him and then gives it out to people and he gets angry when

287
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:49.520
they download your terrible music.
You know,

288
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:53.000
what's more revolutionary than taking hardcore hip hop from the streets and then

289
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:56.210
music with a message combining them and give them to the people.
Absolutely.

290
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:59.870
For free.
100% plus they'd been waiting so long when it's other album,

291
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:03.150
I have called the middle passage that if I didn't give them something I would

292
00:17:03.151 --> 00:17:06.230
have probably got killed and is a really,

293
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:08.510
I mean if you really think about it is the best thing you can.

294
00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:12.040
I mean we always feel about this podcast that,
you know,

295
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.700
I would never want to charge for it.

296
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.990
Like part of the cool thing about it is that it's free.
Right?
Well,

297
00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:20.860
I like doing it for free.
I like that you don't have to pay Shit and you,
oh,

298
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.640
it's not just that.
It's just like,
look,
if you really support what I said,

299
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.110
like the music then come to a show the same way.

300
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.450
Listen to the podcast and be like,
Yo,
if you like what we're doing here for free,

301
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.260
come see the show.
We are going to be live here.
We're going to be dead.

302
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.820
Blog was a blog.
Then that's what happens for the most part of my shows.

303
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.560
It's mostly a podcast fancies taste,

304
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.830
but it's the idea that you decided to just produce a whole CD and put it out

305
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:48.650
like that.
I agree that that's,
that's like that.
That is,

306
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.400
that seems to be the right thing to do.
I mean a lot of people are doing it now.

307
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.600
You've given it to him for free.
Of course.
They're like,

308
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.290
when you give people shit for free,
you know,

309
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.530
you develop the right kind of relationship,

310
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.800
you develop like a giving relationship,
you're giving and you know,

311
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.801
you create this sort of a mutually beneficial relationship with the people that

312
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:13.140
enjoy your shit.
So they actually enjoy,
you know,

313
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.620
the fact that that a lot of people find out about you,

314
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.620
they enjoy the fact that the music is good,
the enjoy the fact,
you know,

315
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.520
they get to be a part of it all.
I'll definitely,
I,
you know,
I,

316
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.420
I didn't know the impact of what I did,
um,
up until like,
you know,

317
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.350
maybe a year or two into it,

318
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:34.380
I really started to get a grasp of it and then slowly accepted the

319
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.910
responsibility.
Um,

320
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:39.060
and I think there's a big difference in between being an independent artist and

321
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:42.870
being in charge of everything that you have to do in order to be successful and

322
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:43.750
then having,
you know,

323
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.530
a label babysit you through a three 60 deal with something like that.

324
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.570
You were completely independent.
Is that how it works?

325
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.910
I pressed up my own units and I have a distribution deal,

326
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:55.020
which means that that's about as independent as we can possibly be.
Me,
you know,

327
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.560
I'm completely ignorant about the music business.
I don't know nothing about it.

328
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:00.900
So explain to me like,
is it,

329
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:03.180
is it hard to did to get to the point where you're at,

330
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:07.290
like to be completely independent and have people know about you and like what

331
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:10.530
sort of distribution channels did you have to go through in order to remain

332
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:11.920
independent?
Well,
in the,

333
00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:16.080
in the very beginning I had to find individuals that already had a distribution

334
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:21.081
deal because at that point I was just one artist and they weren't in the habit

335
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:21.691
of saying,
all right,

336
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:23.640
we're just going to sign an artist who doesn't have a roster.

337
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:25.080
It doesn't have a label.
Um,

338
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.940
so I found a friend of the family that had a very small label called viper

339
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:32.400
records and I was like,
Yo,
let's help build something here.

340
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:36.210
And eventually it led to a few distribution deals.

341
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.780
And now I'm at one where I feel,
you know,
I'm in the right place.

342
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:41.390
I have the right people on my side.

343
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.600
It's a much larger and more expansive one than I traditionally had before.

344
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.190
But just so people understand out there that may not know,
you know,

345
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.310
a record deal is essentially alone with horrible interest rates because you
know,

346
00:19:53.311 --> 00:19:54.360
and even after a loan,

347
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.900
you know what happens when you get a bad loan and you ended up paying it all
off.

348
00:19:57.901 --> 00:19:59.880
You'll get to keep the property blending.
In this case,

349
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:01.350
you don't keep your intellectual property,

350
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:04.170
your masters and your publishing are owned by somebody else.

351
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.380
And if you read the fine contract and legal ease and perpetuity,

352
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.560
and in some cases that's just doesn't make any sense to me.

353
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.100
I think that whole business has completely fallen apart,
right?
I mean,

354
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:19.110
well it is from business.
It's,
it's gone down to a personal appearance business.

355
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:22.020
It's become that more,
right?
Uh,
to to some extent,

356
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:24.230
I think that's why they implemented the three 60 deals.

357
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:27.750
So they felt like they could eat off the shows as opposed to the dwindling

358
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.080
revenue,
say three 60 deals.
What does that three 60 deal means?

359
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:34.740
That the label now collects on everything.
The ancillary rights,
you know,

360
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:39.210
if your music is in a movie,
if you do a show,
they're getting half of the show.

361
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.160
If you do a show,
you're getting like whatever you do,
like a reality show,

362
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.360
they get the money.
Whatever you do do,
if you do it,

363
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.160
if you were in a record in later,
what do you do?

364
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.340
<v 2>Really?
So if you had like the immortal technique show and you know,</v>

365
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:55.060
people traveled around when he was sideways three 64 they would take a piece of

366
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:58.840
that.
Yeah.
If they,
what are they offering though?
That's what,

367
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.790
that's what it depends on what status you have.

368
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:03.100
If you was someone who's built up an independent brand,
see,

369
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.460
I'll give you an example.
How did you do it?
If I have a good idea,
right.

370
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.940
And I say to you,
Joe,
you know,
as a company,
as,
as,
as a gigantic,

371
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.430
a multinational conglomerate,

372
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.990
I got this company about people who get on the Internet and meet other people

373
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:19.870
that are similar and they get to post their pictures.
You're looking at me like,

374
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.130
ah,
yeah.
All right,
well,
how much is it going to sell?
And I'm,

375
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.900
I'm giving you numbers,
but let's say I set up something like my space,

376
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:30.160
which is obviously now not in its former glory,
but if I say,
all right,

377
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:33.010
well I have this company,
my space,
and it has,
you know,

378
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.080
I don't know 20 million people on it,
signed up,
look at the,

379
00:21:37.081 --> 00:21:40.390
the advertising potential that we have here,
then I can suck.

380
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.450
Or somebody like Rupert Murdoch and the buying it for $500 million.

381
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.820
And I think it's just the same thing in music.

382
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:47.890
If you've already built up an independent fan base,

383
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.750
if you have something that's completely your own,

384
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.300
then you're coming to them with everything and you're saying,
listen,

385
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.890
I don't need to give you more than just this.
You know,

386
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.840
I will give you the small percentage,

387
00:21:58.841 --> 00:22:01.990
which is usually between 15 and 25%,
um,

388
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.500
for just distributing the product,
making sure it's an oldest stores.

389
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.360
But isn't it almost everything distributed through electronic media now?

390
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.900
I mean,
I,
I think many actual cds move,

391
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.180
maybe I've sold maybe a about a quarter of million records of the four albums

392
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:22.690
that I've had out and I've moved about half of the product.

393
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.210
We own the last on the record in,
in physical,
not in digital.

394
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:29.910
So it's still about half and half still have,

395
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.430
we're talking about 40 to 60% of the revenue in certain ways.

396
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:37.000
And do you buy cds these days or do you download shit and then occasionally,

397
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.470
you know,
if I,
if I supported artist,

398
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:41.590
if I liked somebody and I think that dope and I there a friend of mine,

399
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.130
I go to the record store,
I'll buy one or two over.
Y'all never see a record.

400
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.710
<v 3>Sure.
When the fuck I buy all my cds,
that Starbucks,
like I was saying,</v>

401
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.730
I do that sometimes.
That's probably the less,
you know what?
I think you're right.

402
00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:56.260
I think the last CD I bought was at Starbucks,
iTunes.
Do you know what I mean?

403
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:59.810
Yeah,
I do.
I assume it's like almost all of my stuff is iTunes now.

404
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.260
I wonder how much sound you're losing.
How much sound are you losing?
Like the,

405
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:06.094
the,
the,
the,

406
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.740
<v 2>they're not ready.
They're not technically not wav file.
Dare,</v>

407
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.920
dare I think seven 20 I mean,
it's not,
it's not perfect,

408
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.220
but it's not bad.
It's a good sound quality.
You,

409
00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:19.600
you have to have a certain standard to put it on there.
I believe.

410
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.710
<v 3>Talked to like old time hippie dude.</v>

411
00:23:21.711 --> 00:23:24.880
So it was telling you that like vinyl record was the best.

412
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.270
Like that was the best quality sound.
You know,

413
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:32.290
we lost a little bit going from that to digital.
We lost something.
Laser does.

414
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.280
We lost it when we went to DVDs.
And laziness are better quality than DVDs.

415
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.780
And it's like boast is better than none.

416
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.150
I don't think they're better than the blueray.
I no know,
but better than DVD.

417
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.070
It's probably just too expensive.
Well,
Blu ray tells

418
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.230
<v 0>laser disks to suck it.
Blu Rays,
this show,</v>

419
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.300
I watched a regular movie the other day and I couldn't believe how bad it
looked.

420
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.210
I watched the ghost in the darkness.
Do you remember that?

421
00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.290
It was with my old Kilmer and Michael Douglas Lion Hunting.

422
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.900
Val Kilmer was a handsome motherfucker.
Man.

423
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.600
He was handsome and chiseled and shit.

424
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.120
<v 4>One of those,
one of those white people conquer Africa movies,
right?</v>

425
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.270
Nobody in Africa could kill a lion because I ain't got to bring it to white

426
00:24:12.271 --> 00:24:16.140
people from England and America to go kill a lion.
You kill a lion.

427
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.770
Got here,
y'all look.
Just put a bloody piece of steak.
Right

428
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.410
<v 0>and just wait there and bang.
You go in line to the coast and the dark it.</v>

429
00:24:25.411 --> 00:24:28.650
It's the ghost in the darkness.
They were intelligent lions.

430
00:24:28.651 --> 00:24:31.560
There were setting traps for them.
Intelligence.

431
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.470
It's kind of becomes a kind of weird,
but there,

432
00:24:35.471 --> 00:24:40.410
there have been animals like that that have just strictly decided to eat people.

433
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.850
There was a cat tiger in India that's been recently going around on Twitter.

434
00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:49.530
The Wikipedia about it is cat and India killed like 400 and something people

435
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.060
before they trying to kill them.

436
00:24:51.061 --> 00:24:54.270
Maybe he's just trying to get even man don't apparently they just develop a

437
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:55.021
taste for flash.

438
00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:59.520
It's just not normal for them because we're not normally on their food chain.

439
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.450
But once they find out about it,
I think we made ourselves not on the food chain.

440
00:25:03.451 --> 00:25:05.810
We're on their food chain,
homey.
If we're,
if you were me,

441
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.580
go into the jungle like in a loin cloth.
Oh yeah.
We're,
we're,

442
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.950
what I mean by we're not on their food chain is not a regular part of their
diet.

443
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.800
So they don't recognize us as food necessarily,

444
00:25:16.801 --> 00:25:19.260
but so she's not a regular part of my diet,

445
00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:21.630
but I'll eat the shit out of once I'm on.
You know what I mean?

446
00:25:21.631 --> 00:25:25.680
So that's five tigers.
Once they find out that they can kill people,

447
00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:29.070
they become a real fucking problem.
They just go exclusively for people.

448
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.540
Yeah.
There was a story about,
uh,
this boat in India.
Well,

449
00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:38.541
there's an area in India called the Sunderbans where over the last 100 years,

450
00:25:38.551 --> 00:25:40.650
tigers have killed close to,

451
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.420
I think it was 300,000 people.
Something insane.
Oh yeah.

452
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.970
Insane number.
Insane number over the last hundred years.
It's crazy.

453
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.470
It's fucking crazy.
There's an area where the water,
yeah,

454
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.100
there's two problems with the area.
One,
the brackish water.

455
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.750
Apparently the tigers drink it and it makes them fucking crazy because it's

456
00:26:00.751 --> 00:26:02.670
water that's like salting.
It's,

457
00:26:02.671 --> 00:26:06.000
they really shouldn't be drinking and it makes it really incredibly irritated

458
00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:10.260
and it makes them super hyper aggressive and they've been known to kill people.

459
00:26:10.261 --> 00:26:15.180
Like for sport,
like they,
there's this one,
tiger killed these guys on a boat,

460
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.840
swam out to the boat,
killed the guy,
dragged him to the shore,

461
00:26:18.841 --> 00:26:19.920
dropped off his body,

462
00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:24.030
jumped back in the water and he did it three times and they couldn't get away

463
00:26:24.031 --> 00:26:27.690
from tigers.
Can swim fast,
man.
He did it for fun.

464
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.030
He did it for fun until he got tired of it.
But you know,

465
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.500
cats are really like some of the most ruthless killers and they'll,

466
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.390
not only will they kill some,

467
00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:39.390
but they'll fuck with it for hours before they kill it.
Like,
Oh yeah,

468
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.780
let me just practice on this living thing in front of my kids and slice.

469
00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:44.100
It's open and this

470
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.460
<v 2>is how you rip.
You know the hamstring on the animal when you're chasing it,</v>

471
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.550
they should give lessons of murder.
Yeah,

472
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.300
they're creates a hell of a parent right there.
Like look,
go kill them right now.

473
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.240
<v 1>Well we know what people don't understand is the reason why human beings have</v>

474
00:26:58.241 --> 00:27:00.970
the symbiotic relationship with cats.
It's cause or rodents.

475
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.870
We had the cats around cause the cats killed the right.
The mice and the rats.

476
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.160
They and the cats are cool.

477
00:27:06.161 --> 00:27:08.950
The cats were hanging out with you and they would go jack the mice and the rats

478
00:27:08.951 --> 00:27:11.500
and they would keep the rats and the mice out of your fucking food.

479
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.660
I mean that was where it all,
but they're there.
They're like killers,

480
00:27:16.661 --> 00:27:19.180
man,
you're going to a house cat.
Everybody's a little house.

481
00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:22.120
Can't you put a bird in front of it going to jump on that shit and murder it

482
00:27:22.121 --> 00:27:22.954
right in front of it.

483
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.910
<v 2>When we lived in a,
in South America,
I remember my,
my father reminds me,
he said,</v>

484
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:30.120
listen,
they had cats out there.
The way that we have mice here.

485
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.560
Like they would sneak her,
they would sneak into,
they would sneak into,

486
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.760
into your kitchen.
They would sneak into your food supply.
Oh yeah.

487
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.740
And Grandma Ma did not give a shit.

488
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:45.360
She would snap it's neck like a bread stick if they got nasty and tried to,
well,

489
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:48.290
feral cats are very different than regular cats.
You know,

490
00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.760
it's a lot of street street dogs out there.
Yeah.

491
00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.910
<v 1>Yeah.
Those are,
those are dangerous animals.
They can get really dangerous.</v>

492
00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.170
And also the Carolina diseases too.
Yeah.
Especially that toxo plasma.

493
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:00.403
I know that,
um,

494
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.570
that that is a disease that literally changes men's behavior and you get it from

495
00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:08.920
cats.
It's the f the nuttiest fucking disease ever.

496
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:13.900
Toxo Toxo plasmosis I think it's called Toxo.
Plasmosis Gandhi's,

497
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:18.370
the actual scientific name.
I might be wrong,
but um,
it comes from cat shit.

498
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.680
And the way it happens is these rats get,
that's why they say crazy is catch it,

499
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.370
huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
For Real.
Toxo asthma.
Yeah.

500
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.960
Plasma Toxo plaids.
Toxoplasmosis toxic.

501
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.020
I think that's what it's called.
And he can't,
it can't affect women.

502
00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:37.830
It only affects,
no,
no,
it effects women as well.
Okay.
Yeah.

503
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.570
Then they're not exactly sure,
but it's really dangerous,

504
00:28:40.571 --> 00:28:43.840
especially for women if they're pregnant or when women are pregnant.

505
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.330
That's why they tell them never fuck with cat litter.

506
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.190
Don't touch a litter box because,
uh,
if they get it and they get infected,
it can,

507
00:28:51.191 --> 00:28:55.530
it,
it can seriously fuck up with the development of the child while they're,

508
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.990
while it's in the woman's room.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a brain parasite.

509
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.480
<v 2>Half cat,
half.</v>

510
00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.240
<v 1>No,
no,
no.
It's not bad.
It just look,
it's,
it's not,</v>

511
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.750
it's whatever this thing is,
it's in a lot of people and you can live with it.

512
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.560
Altered it.
It's,
it's a,
it's a,

513
00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.710
it's a parasite essentially.

514
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.970
It's like a brain worm literally.
Wow.
Yeah.

515
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.330
And what it does is it fucks with the rats and it,

516
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.480
it rewires the rats immune or sexual reward system and has the rat sexually

517
00:29:29.651 --> 00:29:33.250
attracted the smell of cat piss.
Completely changes the rats,

518
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.790
the rats drive and like hijacks his whole system and makes his dick hard for cat

519
00:29:39.401 --> 00:29:42.640
piss.
Literally his deck.
Okay.

520
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.770
So the rat is horny.

521
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:48.520
I mean it's the most ruthless shit nature has ever invented,
right?

522
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.810
So the rat is all horny.
He goes over to the cat is like,
has like bitch the cat,

523
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:57.310
Jack's the rat than the cat hangs around with people and then people get it from

524
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:01.120
the cat and it's been shown to make people extra aggressive.

525
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:05.260
It's been shown to make them,
uh,
act more impulsively.

526
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.470
Bath salt type shit.
They still think it's that bad.

527
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:12.760
But there's a disproportionate amount of motorcycle victims that tests positive

528
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:15.590
for Toxoplasma.
And um,
they,

529
00:30:15.591 --> 00:30:19.180
they think it also can delay reaction time on some people too.

530
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.280
But there's also been a direct correlation between success for supper,

531
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.550
successful soccer teams and areas of infestation for Toxoplasma.

532
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.150
And they think it might actually make men produce more testosterone.

533
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.950
So it's possible that it can trick your body into acting more aggressively,

534
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:39.910
being more sexual,
producing more testosterone,
making you more impulsive.

535
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.630
And here's where it gets really crazy.
In England and Europe,

536
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.400
80% of France is infested with Toxoplasma.

537
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.620
80% of the French people,
people from France.
Yeah,
80% you think so?
No,
I know.

538
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:58.030
So like this is like scientific [inaudible] percent of the dude's or people
here.

539
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.090
<v 2>Yeah,
well they are very violent people,
Joe.
I mean,</v>

540
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.690
you know what I think is unfair is when I heard um,
the,

541
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.140
the administration Republican administration and the Bush,

542
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:13.370
the way they land Bastien and hammered the French simply because they didn't

543
00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:17.570
want to go to Iraq.
And if you think about it,
dirt after World War One,

544
00:31:17.571 --> 00:31:22.070
whenever we had freedom fries and that was just such a fun freedom,
fries,

545
00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.530
whatever,
cock sucker came up with that idea.
You know,

546
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.130
I hope you die in a car fire.

547
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.690
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of my fucking life because freedom

548
00:31:29.691 --> 00:31:31.460
fries should be what you're eating.

549
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:35.450
Fucko because without friends there would be no United States of America on

550
00:31:35.451 --> 00:31:39.110
several occasion,
Francis didn't want to get bullied into something crazy.

551
00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.240
No smart.
I tell this to us,
they became like,
cow,
you know what it is?

552
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:49.280
The Middle East was divided long time ago through a treaty called Sikes Pico

553
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.630
where the European nations decided that Turkey or the Ottoman empire was the

554
00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:56.990
sick man of Europe.
So they cut it up.
Everyone got their little slice.

555
00:31:56.991 --> 00:32:01.610
England got what's now Iraq and uh,
and Egypt,
um,

556
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.140
France got,
uh,
parts of North Africa,
Syria and Lebanon.

557
00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:11.120
So really it's not that I'm scared to fight.
No,
that's just not my slice.
Homie.

558
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.860
You take care of your own problems there.

559
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.640
If there's an issue over here where I'm getting money and I have the remanence

560
00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:20.000
of the CADAC,
this Shabbat and all this legacy of intervention,

561
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:24.050
because realistically you look at the Crusades,
they were run by Normans,

562
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.630
by freshmen,
by people who were maybe five,

563
00:32:26.631 --> 00:32:31.370
six generations away from a man called Rolo Viking who invaded and then became,

564
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.660
you know,
Duke of Normandy.

565
00:32:32.661 --> 00:32:36.800
So you're talking about an individual on a group of people who have been warring

566
00:32:36.801 --> 00:32:40.010
and killing the beginning from the very,
I mean,
French

567
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.540
<v 0>people,
they get away with it because you think of them in wine and poems.</v>

568
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.230
But look at history,
and I'm not denigrating the French.
I'm saying y'all are wow.

569
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:51.050
Motherfuckers.
Y'All are some very,
very violent people.

570
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:56.051
You've been been involved in every sort of chaos and Melay since bone cell.

571
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:58.490
But the modern ones have evolved and they're like,

572
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:01.580
we're not interested in anymore.
We'd rather make really good wine and fuck.

573
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.530
They got a lot of good points.
The modern French are very cool.

574
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:07.820
They have it down there.

575
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:11.090
They're doing the right thing now fucking with the world.
You know,
the modern,

576
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.080
the modern French,
they don't want to be high fructose corn syrup and all that.

577
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.020
When I go out to Europe,
it's different.
Soda taste,

578
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:22.940
different food doesn't make you feel as just as heavy and sat and you walk out

579
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:25.040
of there like,
yeah,
we're not,

580
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:26.990
but in any way saying there's anything wrong with being French.

581
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.340
I met a lot of really cool French people.

582
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:32.270
I just find it fascinating when people come from really ancient cultures because

583
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:34.850
our culture is so god damn new.
You know?

584
00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:38.750
And if you look at the human race and look at like in the areas where it's been

585
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:42.350
established and culture has been established for the longest to really the most

586
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:45.790
backward areas.
It's like Iraq.
Iraq is Sumir.

587
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:50.180
That's like one of the oldest known civilization where this the cradle of

588
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:51.710
civilization.
But he's,
I go,
you know,

589
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.390
even here we had indigenous people living here for thousands of years before and

590
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.750
yeah.
Oh sure.
Well,

591
00:33:56.751 --> 00:33:59.810
you know what's really fascinating with a lot of people don't know is most of

592
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:03.530
North America was covered in a mile high sheet of ice up until about 10,000

593
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:06.320
years ago.
So when everybody was just balling it up in the,

594
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:09.830
in Europe and having a great time and partying all throughout the world with,

595
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.250
we was covered in ice except for Central America,

596
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:18.200
South America where you find sure.
Lots and lots of,
of different peoples.

597
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.640
Mostly they focus on Aztec Maya,
but there are so many other,

598
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:26.780
it'd be like when I came back to the Omex to Latin America,
the old Mex,

599
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.650
you look at their,
their,
uh,
their Shamans,
their tradition of religion,

600
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:33.650
their explanation of human society,

601
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.860
their use of psychotropic drugs go completely independent,

602
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:42.380
advanced civilization.
And that's what people aren't aware of.

603
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:45.350
Like when you go back like many,
many thousands of years,

604
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:48.920
what gets really interesting is it's really hard to reach other people.

605
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.780
So that was when people were developing very uniquely on their own.

606
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.560
You know,
cultures develop very uniquely,
like in their own little,

607
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.300
they're their own little place.

608
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:03.640
They weren't having like the constant intervention that we have from,

609
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.490
from all over the world.

610
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.810
So if you look at like what the advanced civilization of thousands of years ago

611
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:12.460
in north and South America rather,
and you look at the mind Tivoli,

612
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.030
like what a fucking fascinating path they,
those guys went down.
I mean,

613
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.050
what an amazing path these guys went down thousands and thousands of years ago

614
00:35:21.051 --> 00:35:24.260
because no one was fucking with them because people,
they were like,

615
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.090
this is what they came up with.

616
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.070
What they came up with was incredible fucking stone structures that mirror the

617
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:35.360
cosmos and they were doing shit that nobody was thinking about in Europe.

618
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.160
No one who was thinking about the same time.
Nobody was thinking about

619
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.660
<v 3>any of the fucking shit.
Those guys.
Right.</v>

620
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.050
<v 2>You know what my favorite part is when I hear people say,
Oh,
you know,</v>

621
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:47.130
they had so many scientific advancements that as text Maya,
an Inca,

622
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:52.310
like the aliens must've helped you to do it on a one on one level.

623
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:54.670
I think that's pretty interesting.

624
00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:58.980
And Ted even acknowledged for someone to say that there is extra terrestrial

625
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:01.530
life,
but at the same time,
my question is this,

626
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.190
those developments happened over the course of hundreds of years of thousands of

627
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.520
years.

628
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.510
We're looking at American society now that went from being in a fucking horse

629
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:14.490
and buggy 150 years ago to now being on the moon and everybody's got a cell

630
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:18.720
phone the size of a pack of tic tacs and whatnot.
So listen,

631
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.520
if the aliens helped anybody,
they helped people here in America,

632
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.180
they can help us.
You know what I mean?
Well,
I developed that over hundreds and,

633
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.590
and I say thousands of years of,
of work and,
and science or whatnot,

634
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.800
or then they've been helping everybody the whole time.

635
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.910
<v 3>I think it's,
it's silly to assume that the aliens helped us,
but,
uh,</v>

636
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.760
I don't,
I don't rule out the possibility.

637
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.680
I don't just because I think the human,
the human race is so ridiculous.

638
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.401
The whole,

639
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:52.110
the whole lot of us were so strange and bizarre that I don't,

640
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:56.280
it's just the fact that we even exist talking monkey in fact,

641
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:58.140
that we can send satellites into space.

642
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.290
Just the fact that we can do the nutty shit that we can do.

643
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.180
I would never rule out that somewhere along the line we got fucked with.
Yeah.

644
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:09.360
Someone gave us some shit or fucked with us a little bit or you know,

645
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.590
did some shit with some monkeys and made people,
I'm,
I'm not ruling that out man.

646
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:18.600
I'm just not rule that out.
I would say aliens before big foot,
big foot.

647
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:21.730
I'm going squatch and check him out.
Told you this,

648
00:37:21.731 --> 00:37:26.070
this fucking whole area's very squats.
It was a lot of trees across the street.

649
00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:29.370
I noticed that.
That's a very squatch she has some trees right down the block,

650
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:32.470
man.
I liked him going big bigfoot and they're not mad at those trees.
Those.

651
00:37:32.471 --> 00:37:35.320
It cannot be hating.
You want to come with me?
No.
Come on man.

652
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:39.360
I'm gonna go camping.
Yeah,
let's go play in the woods and get raped by some dude.

653
00:37:39.361 --> 00:37:41.080
We're going to go find Sasquatch.
What if,

654
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.300
what if we really found one came back with change?

655
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.590
How do you know that there's not a few thousand of them?

656
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.630
They're hiding in the woods.

657
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.250
Jupiter is 40,000 just encounter.
You know when we're going to no man,

658
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:54.180
when this fucking,

659
00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:58.230
these 30,000 proposed drones are in the sky in the next couple of years,

660
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.320
we would already know from Google maps or Google earth,

661
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.380
they would see a big foot on Google map.
There's 4,000

662
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.610
Google maps.
Maybe they're in the cage on the ground.

663
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.230
They don't have like a detailed picture of every square foot of the Pacific

664
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.020
northwest where I wouldn't believe in Loch ness before.

665
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.650
I think loch ness is probably just like an eel.

666
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.460
It's just retarded.

667
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.540
<v 2>They have found a relic species all over the world.</v>

668
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:31.980
They found out on something called a cola can't in a,
in South Africa,

669
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:36.100
they thought that was dead for 60 million years.
So I can't even imagine

670
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.070
<v 0>what's at the bottom of the ocean.
I don't even want to know.
Part of me,</v>

671
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.040
part of me wants to know,
but the other half of me is like,
Yo listen,

672
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:45.140
you don't want to wait that shit up.
The cracking or whatever the fuck is down.

673
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.550
Well,
you know,

674
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:49.690
they found evidence that there was something like a crack and a giant octopus

675
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:53.680
type creature in the norm because the problem with,
what do they call them?

676
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:57.390
Cephalopods what does that,
what they called Maliek's the related to malls.

677
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.570
But what they don't have,
they don't have anything to their body.
They're,

678
00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:03.000
they're just,
they're jelly.
You know what I'm saying?
I mean they don't,

679
00:39:03.001 --> 00:39:06.880
there's no bones there except for their teeth.
So when they die,
that's it.

680
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.870
Their body just rots.
You know,
an octopus is,
it's,

681
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.880
it's just one piece of undulating flesh.

682
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:17.050
Completely different than our idea of like a bone structure.
And you know,

683
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:20.500
a skeletal [inaudible] didn't have any of that shit.
So

684
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.780
apparently they found fossils of what they think are enormous suction cups and

685
00:39:28.121 --> 00:39:32.290
several of them in a row and they're pretty sure that what that is is that's

686
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:36.070
what's left of an enormous octopus that used to live in the ocean.

687
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.340
So the idea of the cracking,
it might've been a real thing.

688
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.670
It might have been an enormous octopus.
There's to be eaten.
Yeah.

689
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:45.370
Back in those times when you ran into something,

690
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.710
there was no such thing as a handshake back in line,

691
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.730
but you can imagine was an octopus that took out a boat and they actually got

692
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:59.230
that big like boat size,
like those fucking cracking pictures.

693
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:01.570
I mean they had a mega don,
which is basically,

694
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.190
we're talking about a great white shark that's,
you know,
65 feet long.

695
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:08.860
That shit's crazy.
And like fucking,

696
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.550
and their babies were like the size of great white sharks.

697
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:16.150
Now it would be a baby megalodon on a 30 foot megalodon.

698
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.580
Our friend bud has a tooth in his office,
a mega dawn tooth.

699
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.560
You pick it up and you just go,
what the fuck,
man?
It's a fossil.

700
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:25.160
So you know what a fossil is,

701
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:28.700
is the actual bone gets replaced with minerals in time.

702
00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:32.500
So it's like really like a piece of stone.
It's all like a black piece of stone.

703
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.160
I had explained that to him.
Dudes think that this is just know it's a bone.

704
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.380
That's the actual tooth.
No,
no,

705
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.780
the tooth doesn't exist anymore and this is a fossil of the tooth.

706
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.840
I had explained it to him and she explained it and showed me no,
it's a real too.

707
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.490
It's like I paid for it.
I got to,
I got a certificate.

708
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.380
So it's real like I'm telling you this,
that's not exactly what a fossil is,

709
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:54.770
but anyway,
it's so big.
It's like a giant blade.
Like

710
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.860
it's fucking huge and you're looking at it like that was in you.

711
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:03.950
Just picture that in a mouth and the picture how big that fucking mouth and

712
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.180
sharks went through teeth like,
like Carson went and wives.
I mean boom,

713
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:13.000
boom,
boom.
Next one fell out.
Boom.
What a crazy animal.
The the world is invented.

714
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.360
I mean the word when you just toxo plasma and sharks,

715
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:20.020
the fact that those two mother fuckers exist.
You know what I'm saying?

716
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.300
What about a shot for a parasite that makes you wonder that as sharp with toxo

717
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.143
plasma

718
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.360
puts it didn't have tentacles,

719
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:32.040
but they had sharks instead of tenant calls the they charge to the end.
Yeah,

720
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.310
like the legs would be just sharp.
Oh my God.
Why not?
With talk to my classmate

721
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.800
that he'll do that to you.
But dude,

722
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:47.720
imagine that would be crazy at the end of it.

723
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:51.290
So much.
This is part of somebody's bad trip out there.

724
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:54.740
Someone's about to hit the Joe Rogan.
You stole that idea from me.

725
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.460
You know what's really crazy is that these people in South Africa have sharks,

726
00:41:58.461 --> 00:42:00.500
the great whites on some sort of endanger list.

727
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.970
So you're not supposed to be killing him.

728
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.450
I'm at read that to do thinking about lifting the ban because another one killed

729
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:06.680
the fucking surfer recently.

730
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.960
Like apparently they're on some sort of endangered list.

731
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:13.790
One surfer died as opposed to like the hundred thousand or like 12 million

732
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:17.690
shocks that we kill every year.
Well,
that's,
that's a pretty good record,

733
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:21.890
but still I say all sharks can suck my dick and we should kill every one of
them.

734
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.940
I'm on team people and I like surfing and if there's anything out there that

735
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:29.810
will cut me in half when I'm surfing.
No,
not really interested in that thing.

736
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:30.620
Sticking around.

737
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.620
I say we send in torpedoes on submarines and just Jack every fucking shark we

738
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:38.090
find if we did that,

739
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:42.260
then all the other species that their spokes exactly right and then we'd have

740
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:46.500
more fish.
We'd see what I'm saying dog,
but we'd have less stuff.

741
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.910
Less of other stuff too.
Oh yeah.
You can't completely fuck with the,

742
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:54.590
we would probably give rise to some new intelligent dolphin that knows how to

743
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:57.450
make a gun.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

744
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.350
if you fuck the balance of power up in the ocean like that,
you know,

745
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:01.940
who knows what the result is going to be.

746
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.210
The fact that we do that though is a part of nature.

747
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.840
I mean it is our own human curiosity that it leads us to fuck with things and

748
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.920
remove things from the food chain and use our infinite wisdom to change like the

749
00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:14.330
top,
ah,
gruffy of the earth.

750
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.570
But that is also a part of nature because we are all nature.
You know?

751
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.880
Even if people say that,
oh,
plastic is unnatural sort of,
but no,
it's natural.

752
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.910
The shitty humans make this.
This brings up an interesting question.

753
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:30.380
I had a conversation with a friend of mine,
Matt,
if we evolve ourselves,
right?

754
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.630
If we decide to genetically modify ourselves and people say that's an unnatural,

755
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.130
isn't that nature is nature us being,
it's all natural.

756
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:44.090
We have the ability now to be intelligent enough to map and select certain genes

757
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:45.770
and to say,
all right,
you know what?

758
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.930
I want to be able to take this gene that says that my organs will fail at like

759
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:55.790
80 and 90 years and I'm going to put a zero on that.
So now instead of being,

760
00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.320
you know,
80 when I'm 80 I'm going to look 80 when I'm like 800 yeah.

761
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.010
I think the idea of natural is getting to be silly and I think we have to look

762
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:09.011
at it as organic and inorganic and organic still being natural but created by

763
00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:13.310
people.
That's what it is.
Organic being something that occurs without any,

764
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.550
any intervention at all,
but it's natural that people intervene.

765
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.990
It's where they're curious to do.

766
00:44:17.991 --> 00:44:21.680
There's a reason why this people that are in school that are studying genetic

767
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:22.514
engineering,
okay,

768
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.490
there's a reason why they would rather have those people figure their shit out

769
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:30.491
in 30 years and then fuck with my man and exit the food that I be out.

770
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.150
Look,
it's all good.

771
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.760
<v 2>Instead of testing it out on the public now and then hiding it.</v>

772
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:39.000
Because the funny thing is that if you're so proud of the product,

773
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.230
why won't you put your name on it?
Monsanto,

774
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.950
<v 1>I see the,
the real issue is not the science.</v>

775
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.730
The real issue is the commerce behind the science because the science is,

776
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.080
is valid.
There's,
there's,

777
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:53.520
there's certainly science to improving upon things and there might be things

778
00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:56.700
that cause problems with people that we might be able to solve with science,

779
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:01.910
but the problem is then you get commerce involved and commerce looks at all

780
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:06.240
they're trying to do is figure out the best way to extract money from this and

781
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:11.241
the best way to extract money is to patent all their creations and then make a

782
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:16.830
creation that is completely unnatural and force people to buy it completely

783
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:20.850
unnatural in that you can't even use the seeds from the plant to grow.

784
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:25.260
New plants are no seeds or there are no seeds or the seeds that you have.

785
00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:25.501
They don't,

786
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:28.770
they have a shelf life like they'll expire in a shorter amount of time.

787
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.100
There's a fascinating thing that happens when people get involved in big groups

788
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:37.410
of people that are designed to make money,
corporations,

789
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:40.290
and there's a great documentary about it called the corporation

790
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:47.110
where it's essentially show how there's a diffusion of responsibility when

791
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:52.200
there's a large group of people acting towards a goal and that the essentially

792
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:55.860
the snowflake doesn't realize it's a part of an avalanche.

793
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.110
It just feels like it's a snowflake.
You know?

794
00:45:58.111 --> 00:46:02.010
You just feel like you're a person doing your job and meanwhile you've got

795
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:07.310
commerce mixed up somehow or another in science and progress and you've gotten

796
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:09.210
commerce involved.

797
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:13.170
So it's enforcing it's own version of these things before we know the exact

798
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:14.790
results of what could happen.

799
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:18.870
Long term ingestion has it can infect the other things in the environment.

800
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:22.380
If the parasites that are naturally preying on weed or whatever the fuck it is

801
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:23.790
that they're making,
how,
what,
what is it,

802
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.490
what happens to them when they're not allowed to breed,

803
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.630
when they're not allowed to eat,

804
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:31.740
when they're not allowed to feast on these plants that they've naturally had to

805
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.080
protect people from like what about,
what about that?
What,
what is,
what is,

806
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.370
what is the backfiring of that?
You know,
is it bark beetles?
You know,

807
00:46:38.371 --> 00:46:39.660
what the fuck is it?
You know what I mean?

808
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.080
<v 2>I think on many levels,
the</v>

809
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.350
dat analysis that you brought up,

810
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.990
that analogy can then be used for so many other things.
You know,

811
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.820
it's not just about somebodies health now,

812
00:46:52.821 --> 00:46:56.970
but now commerce is dictating politics.
Pilot comp,

813
00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:00.410
it becomes the human race.
In other words,

814
00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.100
companies come into existence not to find out what's the best medicine for

815
00:47:04.101 --> 00:47:04.550
people,

816
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.820
but what's the cheapest way they can produce something that's going to offset

817
00:47:07.821 --> 00:47:11.420
symptoms and then keep them coming back for more.
It's not,
there's no,

818
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.620
there's no money in the cure.

819
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:16.600
There's only money in a temporary solution because if you cure it then right,

820
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:21.560
<v 1>and it's pure greed because there's still an incredible amount of money to be</v>

821
00:47:21.561 --> 00:47:26.561
made if they were just in the seed business and if they made seeds and then the

822
00:47:26.841 --> 00:47:29.900
farmer could use that plan and grow seeds and

823
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.790
<v 0>or get the seats from it and grow new plants and it could be a natural thing,</v>

824
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.020
you know,
and then you,
you couldn't force people into suicide.

825
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:43.090
Like you've got like Indian farmers are committing suicide as a result of being

826
00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:46.800
forced into using genetically modified foods and crops and being forced into an

827
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.310
incredible debt they can't repay.

828
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.590
There's something like every 30 seconds and Indian farmer commits suicide.

829
00:47:51.591 --> 00:47:55.270
It's crazy.
It's fucking crazy.
I mean they've attributed not no bullshit,

830
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:58.510
more than a hundred thousand suicides in India to uh,

831
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.100
being a connected to a genetically modified crops.
It's fucking nuts.

832
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.070
They get locked into these contracts.
They can't,

833
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.510
they're not making as much money as they think they should be making.

834
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.260
Being the largest democracy in the world.

835
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.690
You would think that they would have the,

836
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.860
the ability for people to petition to say this is illegal,
but then again,

837
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.550
I think the problem with democracy and the problem would have in those things is

838
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:26.110
that that the commerce that you're talking about is now front and center in

839
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:28.390
terms of everything in terms of saying,

840
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.980
I'm going to sponsor you to be the next candidate or the next president or the

841
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:37.270
next congressman from,
but your topic,
you're fucking with life so much.

842
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.550
When you make something that won't even reproduce,

843
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.590
you're fucking with the life so much.

844
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.660
I just don't think you should be allowed to to that.

845
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.620
I think that's where it gets really tricky when you're fucking with life solely

846
00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:51.520
for commerce.
Like your idea of what it would it shouldn't,
shouldn't do.

847
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.840
Like you're not allowing the cycle of life to continue in a natural fashion.

848
00:48:55.841 --> 00:49:00.190
You're mean you,
you're,
you're making like suicide plants.
That's a,

849
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:02.950
that's a fascinating thing.
And when we let people do that,
because like,

850
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:06.160
why would you do that?
You don't only do that if you're greedy,
you know,

851
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.280
like you want to keep coming back for you that you're going to put on the back

852
00:49:09.281 --> 00:49:09.971
making the,
the,

853
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:14.350
the plant Beto I'm people eat better when anything is just to put them in debt

854
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:17.380
and you're going to put them in a non-natural cycle.
Like why do they have to,

855
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:22.020
you know,
they can't get,
none of it can be used.
You can't like read,

856
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:25.930
take the seeds and plan and make new plants.
Really the fuck are you doing.

857
00:49:25.931 --> 00:49:29.830
But then again,
that mirrors everything else.
It's like,
look,
you're getting a car,

858
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:33.940
a car that what does what that puts gas in air that that pollutes the

859
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:38.800
environment that makes us re required to be in a partnership with some of the

860
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:41.260
most uh,
off,
excuse me,

861
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.840
some of the most Italo attarian states that exist in,

862
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.590
in the world practically that we turned a blind eye to.

863
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.070
Now we'll focus on those that don't give us access to their natural resources,

864
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.600
don't have bases,
um,
in their countries.
But the ones that don't,
those that say,

865
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:59.590
okay,
well now we want to interfere.
Now we want a piece of the pie.

866
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.440
Now this is commerce talking.
This is no longer money.

867
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:05.650
And I think that that should be something that at some point we have to accept

868
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:06.430
as a country.

869
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.910
And then I think it would be tough for the soldiers to look at that saying yes.

870
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:15.270
On one hand it can be said that I'm here to be able to confront,

871
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.810
you know,
a state that sponsors terrorism.
It's a good line.
But at the same time,

872
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.770
what if all of those soldiers were told?
At the same time,
listen,

873
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:28.070
you're also here because the American economy and in order to fund this

874
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:33.070
<v 2>lifestyle that we live requires you to secure a government that by our standards</v>

875
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:39.950
has horrific human rights abuses by our standards of the same standards and

876
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:42.200
litmus test.
We used to criticize these other places,

877
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:47.480
has terrible human rights offenses,
but we need their resources.

878
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:51.350
We need them to be a part of us.
We need to support this lifestyle.

879
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:54.500
We can't because it's like if we got divorced from reality and all of us,

880
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:58.100
all of a sudden,
hey,
look,
bitch,
you can't live like you're used to live.

881
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:01.880
You're going to have to accept not going to the spy every other day.

882
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:05.000
You're only going to be able to go once a month.
Like,
no,
that's a terrible idea.

883
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.130
Kill 'em all.
Let's take what we have from them.

884
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:11.450
And I think that that metaphor applies not just to that,

885
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.550
but everything.
Now everything's about money.

886
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:15.680
It's not about what's good for humanity anymore.

887
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:17.870
Very rarely do you find someone who says,
Oh yeah,

888
00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:19.850
I'm just doing this because I'm trying to find,

889
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.370
you know what the best thing is for people is it's no right?

890
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.140
How can I make this into,
you know,
a moneymaking opportunity,

891
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.400
even though it fucks up the entire point in the perspective of what I was trying

892
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:32.420
to do in the first place.

893
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.820
<v 1>Right?
It just becomes about about making money regardless of the consequences of</v>

894
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.880
trying to make you have leeway with entertainment to be able to do that.
Yeah.

895
00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:47.120
A happy middle ground man.
You know,
just people have to just not be content.

896
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.450
That's really what it is.
Think about what you're doing for real.

897
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:53.930
Think about what you're doing and say is that it might be an a cunt,

898
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:57.200
like look at it,
look at it.
Realistically,
if you're being a can't stop it.

899
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.880
It's really that simple.

900
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:04.060
And if you got some fucking crazy ass business where you're robbing people of

901
00:52:05.841 --> 00:52:10.520
their natural resources and go in there with tanks and,
and killing,

902
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:14.750
who knows how many fucking civilians and somehow or another you've passed it off

903
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:20.170
as helping someone's freedom or supporting freedom or making sure we're free.

904
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:24.430
You're a cunt.
That's a con thing.
You're,
that's crazy.

905
00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.530
The crazy thing is it's always on the top level and it's always people who never

906
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:29.120
gone to war themselves.
They're all chicken hawk.

907
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.840
<v 2>Always somebody who has to suffer and go exactly.</v>

908
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:36.140
Being apart from their family and who really,
you know,
I have a lot of friends.

909
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:38.660
I have some family in the military,
you know what I mean?

910
00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:40.730
Shout out to all my people's out there.
Um,

911
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:44.440
<v 1>you can say that legit.
You could say shout out to all my people's out there.</v>

912
00:52:44.441 --> 00:52:48.300
It's funny,
it goes out to say it's gotta be sort of funny,
kind of shake shack.

913
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.000
I told my people's out there,
I want to get a shout out I shark.

914
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:55.450
I just want people to realize like it's not that when we,

915
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:59.310
when we questioned this country,
I'm not questioning the people that we're not,

916
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.240
we're not,
we're not angry at jaw.

917
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.450
We're angry at the individuals who are in charge.
They never take responsibility.

918
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:06.790
I have a friend who went to a,
went to Iraq,

919
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:10.420
he was in the army reserve for 20 years.
Okay.
And on,

920
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.960
he had like less than a month ago and they sent him to Iraq for a year and a

921
00:53:13.961 --> 00:53:17.700
half.
They just can do that to you.
And then they send them back against sign it.

922
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:22.030
Apparently they can keep sending you back even though you like do your time in

923
00:53:22.031 --> 00:53:26.070
the military and Dick Cheney sign some shit where they it so they

924
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.580
<v 0>could just bring you back if necessary.
If you're a trained soldier,</v>

925
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:32.610
the resources to train a new soldier,
it's too difficult apparently.

926
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:34.540
So too much money.
We can't afford that.

927
00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:37.800
We've got to bring you back or whatever the fuck the excuse is.
But that's crazy.

928
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:39.510
Your,
you've made a person your slave.

929
00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.750
So what if that person starts up a business?
What if that person out in the,

930
00:53:42.751 --> 00:53:46.740
the legit freeworld is a,
you know,
got a family.
He starts up a business.

931
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.860
Tough Shit.
Tough Shit.
You got to go to the desert,
you go to the,

932
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:54.510
go to the desert for a year,
maybe more.
I think at some point,
um,

933
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:59.460
the individuals that were in charge of designing a war,
you know,

934
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:04.260
look at people that statistics and not real individual people because they're

935
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:05.710
not going through it.
You know,

936
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.250
they're more than happy to let somebody else's child do it.

937
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:09.330
But when you look at them,

938
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:12.180
it's like even the people that make this genetically modified food,

939
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.870
you know what I would believe a little bit more if I seen your kids drinking

940
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:19.770
that milk,
but I know that they're not,
or the individuals that'll say,
oh yeah,

941
00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:23.950
you know,
I like,
I remember there was some story about a girl in the bush.

942
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.330
They probably would drink that milk.
See,
that's not even a problem.

943
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:30.450
I don't think these people are on a shirt and tie.
I think they're charlatans.

944
00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.980
They're just in commerce.
I don't think they're watching their diet that clearly.

945
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.830
I think when people have millions and millions of dollars,

946
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.580
some doctor's gonna say,
you know what?
This is probably not good for you.

947
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:44.280
You probably shouldn't be doing what is like,
what?
What is,

948
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:47.490
what sort of genetically modified milk would be bad for you?

949
00:54:47.491 --> 00:54:51.210
Is there something like that?
Is there a genetically modified?
There's a company,

950
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.650
um,
that,

951
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:57.240
that recently is gained a lot of attention called Monsanto and they've had this

952
00:54:57.241 --> 00:55:01.470
big car recently.
They made DDT
recently.

953
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.080
Now more than ever,
I think they changed their name.

954
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:06.480
Do they change the name for a while?
They've been in the game for a while,

955
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:10.830
but we're talking about recently had so many new investigations open.

956
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:16.230
Well,
they lost a giant multibillion dollar lawsuit to farmers in Brazil,
right?

957
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.370
Fuck yeah.
Brazil.
Brazilian,
fuck.
Yeah,
man.
They,

958
00:55:20.371 --> 00:55:22.200
they sued the shit out of beautiful women.

959
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.750
I win against Monsanto Jitsu and almost fucking every weight class.

960
00:55:27.751 --> 00:55:28.740
I was a Brazilian champion.

961
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.700
There's more Brazilian champions in MMA because now you got Hennen Barao who

962
00:55:32.701 --> 00:55:37.350
just won the interim bantamweight title and then you got junior dos Santos,

963
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:39.810
who is the heavyweight champion.
He had Anderson Silva,

964
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.680
who's the middleweight champion and you've got,
you know,
there's,
there's,

965
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:47.310
there's tough guys and every weight class from,
from Brazil,

966
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:51.240
although Joe say Aldo is the 145 pound champion,

967
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:52.620
I mean Jesus Christ,

968
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.770
somebody that's a lot of fucking weight classes dominated by a Brazilian.

969
00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:00.590
Somebody told me you,
you recently got a black belt in Jujitsu.
Yeah,
yeah,
I did.

970
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.380
Yeah.
Congratulations.
I know that's a lot.
That's a lot of work.

971
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.350
A lot of getting choked in my neck,
my friend.
A lot of that.

972
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:10.230
I've got a back problem because of the way you see me doing like that all the

973
00:56:10.231 --> 00:56:14.160
time.
It's because of my back is always fucked up from Jujitsu,
but it's so fun.

974
00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:15.960
I can't help but do it more.
I had a,

975
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.430
I actually told you Jitsu for about three or four years when I was at digit real

976
00:56:19.431 --> 00:56:23.130
and gave me a,
that's great.
Gave me a lot of real,
real life experience.
I mean,

977
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.070
yeah,
you struggle.

978
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.520
<v 2>My sensei at the time,
you know,
he was a,
it was a Vietnam veteran,</v>

979
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.530
a real no nonsense kind of dude.

980
00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.920
<v 1>It's always a good plot and a story of Vietnam,</v>

981
00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.530
no turns the hood to teach karate.
No,
he was always,

982
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:36.930
<v 2>they was always in the hood.
Uh,</v>

983
00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:41.980
shout out to Sensei Stanley Thompson and he wasn't a very,

984
00:56:42.021 --> 00:56:44.000
very,
very positive brother in terms of,

985
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.380
of how we advanced in our lessons because I remember getting life lessons from

986
00:56:48.381 --> 00:56:48.711
the man,

987
00:56:48.711 --> 00:56:53.450
not just how to you know someone or hit someone but when to and why to,

988
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.100
you know what I mean?
And the discipline required.

989
00:56:55.101 --> 00:56:58.400
Like I put it on Twitter the other day.
One of the things that I always remember,

990
00:56:58.401 --> 00:56:59.570
he told me,
he's like,
listen,

991
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:02.420
you know why you're wasting time with your friends running around.

992
00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.030
There's somebody that's running and doing pushups.

993
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:08.600
When you getting high and drunk with your friends,
somebody is doing Kata.

994
00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.570
When you are sitting there playing video games,

995
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:15.770
someone is running laps and smashing,
you know,
a,

996
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.320
a practice dummy.
And when this person meets you,

997
00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:23.210
they're going to fucking destroy you.
And I took that like Jesus Christ.

998
00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:26.780
Like either I'm going to have to commit to this or to that.
You know what I mean?

999
00:57:26.781 --> 00:57:29.240
But it,
but it definitely put those things at the forefront to say,

1000
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:30.410
you know what young brother,

1001
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.740
you going to choose your life for yourself and this is what you want.

1002
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:35.720
You can do it.
But at the same time,

1003
00:57:35.721 --> 00:57:37.910
if you're going to be involved in a situation,

1004
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:41.780
just understand what the consequences of that are.
You know?

1005
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:42.500
<v 1>Well for me it would,</v>

1006
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:47.500
martial arts are the first time I understood the connection of what you put in

1007
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:51.210
is what you get out.
I didn't understand that connection before.

1008
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.670
I always like wanting things to happen for me,

1009
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:58.880
I didn't really have like a physical thing where it was like so difficult to do

1010
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.360
that.
I realized the only way to get good at it is just intense,

1011
00:58:03.361 --> 00:58:06.500
hard work and focus everything else in my life.
You know,
I was,

1012
00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.930
I was like 15 when I finally got into martial arts.
Like seriously got into it.

1013
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.720
But everything else in my life,
you know,
whether it was,
uh,

1014
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.870
getting into art or playing other sports there,
there was,

1015
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.720
there was no consequences.
You know?
It's like,

1016
00:58:18.721 --> 00:58:22.020
so what if your picture didn't look that good?
So what if you dropped the ball,

1017
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.640
he didn't get your ass kicked,

1018
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:27.870
but once it was someone beats your ass once it was like,
oh,

1019
00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:30.270
this is the top of the foot.
It's either this or kill you.

1020
00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:33.210
It's either this or kill you.
It's a beat your ass or kill you.
And guess what?

1021
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:35.430
If someone can beat your ass,
they can kill you.

1022
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:36.960
They can kill you with their fucking hands.

1023
00:58:36.961 --> 00:58:39.300
If a guy gets your back and he chokes you and you tap,

1024
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.670
you're essentially admitting that he could have killed you.

1025
00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:44.010
If this is a life or death struggle,
he would have put,

1026
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.260
you would have kept the choke on.

1027
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:47.370
You would have been guide person in other words.
Exactly.

1028
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:51.630
And that that was reality to me.
That was like,

1029
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:56.040
you got to look at,
you've got to look at your game.
You know,
you're like,
you're,

1030
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:57.510
you're fighting game in your life game.

1031
00:58:57.511 --> 00:59:01.500
You've got to look at it hundred percent realistically,
look at it objectively,

1032
00:59:01.501 --> 00:59:03.360
look at it,
stand outside of it and look at it.

1033
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.150
And I didn't have to do that until I started fighting.
I didn't have to do that.

1034
00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.530
<v 2>Marty,
we definitely had,</v>

1035
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:13.210
that was one of the exercises after we had learned stuff or a certain period of

1036
00:59:13.211 --> 00:59:17.800
time,
we have to show what we learned by fighting a Sensei.

1037
00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:19.270
It wasn't like you had to fight him.

1038
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:21.980
We had to fight him and he willing to take it

1039
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.460
<v 0>easy on you.
I know he will beat your ass.
Of course.</v>

1040
00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:28.790
I mean that's just the way it is,
but why is he making it?
How old was this guy?

1041
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.120
No,
I'm not talking about beat us up.
Like leave us on the floor.
Right.

1042
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.900
He definitely,
obviously you stoop down and we were like,

1043
00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.760
maybe I was maybe like 14 like 13 or 14 and I think that it wasn't like,

1044
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:44.540
like I wouldn't ever went home crippled.
I never went home.

1045
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:48.230
Like not being able to see stars.
And you ever cracking you saw stars?

1046
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.920
It was more like I definitely got the wind knocked out of me and I fell down.

1047
00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:53.570
Right.
Definitely he was.

1048
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:57.890
It was someone who had experience teaching young children and had taught his son

1049
00:59:57.891 --> 01:00:01.130
from a very young age.
So it was more like it was,

1050
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.710
it was a controlled place and it was,

1051
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.980
it was more like in the middle of the fight we did something wrong.

1052
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.380
We got punished for it because he said you know better,

1053
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.160
we trained on that for weeks.
You know what I mean?

1054
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:15.620
You know what to do at that particular time and now you're just being lazy

1055
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:19.610
because you know it hurts to do that block that way or it hurts to get down low

1056
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.230
and then get back up.
You know what I mean?

1057
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:25.780
Well what people don't have to experience in life is that realization,
you know,

1058
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.860
sort of this pain.

1059
01:00:27.861 --> 01:00:31.820
The bad thing that has happened to you only happened to you because you didn't

1060
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:35.030
put in the work only happened to you because you weren't focused enough only

1061
01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:38.930
happen to you because you did something that you shouldn't have done and you

1062
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:42.710
have no choice but to learn what the fuck that was and make sure that doesn't

1063
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:46.580
happen again.
Cause that's sucks.
Life lessons.

1064
01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:51.581
Don't talk shit to show on the fear factor that puts you in a headlock and slap

1065
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:54.710
you around like a hoe.
And I only did that to one dude.

1066
01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.500
I only did it cause I thought it was gonna hit me.

1067
01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.790
He wouldn't get away from my face.

1068
01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:01.460
I pushed him away from me twice and I was like,
if this guy comes in again,

1069
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.510
I'm just going to manhandle them.
I mean,
you know,

1070
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.460
some people are really brave when it comes to barking on a woman,

1071
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:11.270
but when they deal with a man,
it's a whole nother story.
Well I was,
you know,

1072
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.320
trying to make sure that it wasn't sued too.
Like I didn't want to do anything.

1073
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:18.470
I knew there was nine cameras on me.
It was like when I had the back of his head,

1074
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.960
I'm wanting to make sure that nothing I did,

1075
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.650
I was going to get me in trouble now because I mean in that position you could

1076
01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:27.860
have done so many other things that would have just left them angry too.

1077
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.320
Because I knew this guy had done some shit before on other shows,
like attack.

1078
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.080
Some counselor on one show and through his wife on the ground on another show.

1079
01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:40.160
I knew it was all he was.
It was crazy.
So I say this much.
When I was at,

1080
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.680
when I was a young man,
my father told me,
he said,
listen,

1081
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.460
the man who hits his woman is a coward.
Like my father was a very strong man.

1082
01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:47.150
He said,
listen,

1083
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.480
because he's taken out all the problems on the rest of the world that people are

1084
01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:52.010
giving him.
You know what I mean?

1085
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:55.550
For all of this and taking it out on the person that's supposed to support him.

1086
01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:58.250
Instead of him doing that,
unless asked my father,
I said,

1087
01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.050
what if it's talking about the Sean Connery?

1088
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.730
What if it's the woman that's given him all the problems?
And I said,
Yo,

1089
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.430
at that point he's just get up and leave.

1090
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:10.490
That's the worst thing you could do to a woman that's obsessed with trying to

1091
01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:15.410
ruin your life.
You get up and walk out,
never answer a phone call and never,

1092
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.560
you know what I mean?
Well,
you just kind of never let it get down that road.

1093
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:20.190
When you see it getting down that

1094
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.070
<v 2>road to being so crazy,
you might hit each other.
You've got to get out.</v>

1095
01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.780
Either change,
both of you come to some mutual agreement or get out.

1096
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:32.310
People don't,
you know,
they get in these crazy patterns in relationships.

1097
01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:33.870
That's a big part of the fucking problem.

1098
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.410
They get used to being in a situation where the yell and scream at each other

1099
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.610
and then when they go into the next relationship,
totally seems normal.

1100
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.590
They grew up like that.
Did you,
I grew up like that.
Did you grow up like that?

1101
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.980
I grew up with,
uh,
both of my parents together.

1102
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.650
I'm not saying that everything was perfect,
but I put it this way.

1103
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.560
My father was a very,
very strict and very,

1104
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:55.260
very like tough man on us,

1105
01:02:55.470 --> 01:03:00.470
but I've never seen my dad hit my mother and I've never seen my father drunk in

1106
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:04.650
my life ever.
Like my dad was,
he taught in the military academy.

1107
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:07.350
He was like really,
really tough on us when we were kids.

1108
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.510
But at the same time I can say that I am everything I am because you know

1109
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:14.550
somebody loved me because he took the time to say,
hey,

1110
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:18.510
you know what I'm going to take?
My son was 12 to the Amazon jungle with me.
Oh,

1111
01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:20.010
you're scared of roaches.
Well,

1112
01:03:20.011 --> 01:03:23.130
what happens when they're all flying to fuck around you now deal with it.

1113
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.980
You know what I mean?
Like deal with the reality of fucking life.
Dude,

1114
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.690
this is life.
You know,
you think you're,

1115
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.390
you think you're poor because we live in Harlem,
right?
Let's go to the jungle.

1116
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:34.290
Let's take you to some little real fucked up area and [inaudible] so you can see

1117
01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:38.820
people that eat like cardboard smashed in with like dog meat and that's their

1118
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:42.000
lunch.
And I know it's cardboard.
You know it's cardboard Joe.

1119
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.320
They know it's cardboard too,

1120
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.650
but there's still going to eat it because they're fucking starving.
He's like,

1121
01:03:46.651 --> 01:03:51.150
so I think my,
my pops really just kind of beat the lessons of life and to me,

1122
01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.880
you know what I mean?
That's good man.
That's good to have.

1123
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.180
That's a lot of times kids will resent the father like that,

1124
01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.690
that puts so much effort and work into it.
But it's tough for dad too.

1125
01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:03.610
You gotta know when to let that fucking kid beat himself.
Oh,
I know,
man.

1126
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:08.640
It's hard.
Hard to raise children.
I mean,
I,
I put it this way,
uh,
you know,

1127
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.130
for a long time me and my father had a very,

1128
01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:14.580
very negative relationship because of all the crazy stuff I was doing.

1129
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.680
And then when I got older,

1130
01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:20.220
I started to realize that a lot of the things that he was trying to do with

1131
01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:24.720
things that were,
were very effective.
Like for one time he kicked me out real,

1132
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.940
real,
real shit.
I hardly ever talk about this,
but fucking we're here.
Um,

1133
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.250
and he was basically like,
no,
look,
I love you.
You know,
you,

1134
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:36.330
you're my firstborn son.
But you know,
you got drugs in his house,
you know,

1135
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.210
there's something else in there.
You know what I mean?

1136
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.730
And you're in danger in the family.

1137
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:46.290
I'm not going to let you endanger your mother and your younger sister by running

1138
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:48.570
around him being crazy.
So you know what you can do,

1139
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.050
you can get your stuff and you can get the fuck out and real shit.
I left.

1140
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:56.340
How old were you?
Like 1615 and a half to do that.

1141
01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:58.290
When you have a 15 and 16 year old is doing that,

1142
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.680
you really don't have any options.
And for a long time,
John,

1143
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.930
I was kind of resentful until I sat back and I said,
damn,

1144
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.150
as cliche as that sounds,

1145
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.840
that really must have hurt him more than it hurt me cause I,
I was like,
fuck you.

1146
01:05:09.841 --> 01:05:12.780
And I left and I walked out.
But for him it must've been like,
damn,

1147
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.300
are you that ignorant or you that foolish at that age?

1148
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:18.010
Which is why I always believe like when I see people

1149
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.310
<v 0>that are in no circumstances,
there was,
this was even before I went to prison.</v>

1150
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:25.510
This was before I had any real league,
which drives and forth for assault.

1151
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:29.890
But I had multiple assault charges.
I just used to fight a lot when I was a kid.

1152
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:31.750
I thought that would solve everything.
You know,

1153
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:34.540
I was the one of those idiots that was willing to fight to the death against

1154
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:37.480
someone who's not my enemy.
And the street is full of those fools right now.

1155
01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.840
This is the life note.
It's not life or dead homie.

1156
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.820
You're going that way and someone's in your way.

1157
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:45.400
You can go around them and it'll be a lot less time.

1158
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:49.450
I'm amazed sometimes at how lippy people get for no reason,

1159
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:53.110
no reason.
People get crazy like they're ready to go.

1160
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:57.580
It's almost like they're bluffing,
but if you call them on their bluff,

1161
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:00.400
they'll go,
you know,
most of the time people are bluffing,

1162
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.450
but they're still there.
They're putting themselves on,
on,
you know,

1163
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.470
unfucking a yellow light.
They're putting themselves in a bad situation.

1164
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:11.030
But I mean at the same time,
Joe,
I not,

1165
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.380
and this is not to excuse my actions and in any way,
shape or form,

1166
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:18.070
I take responsibility for them.
But New York was a very different city.

1167
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.020
Like if you grew up in New York in the,

1168
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:24.280
in the late eighties early nineties you had to have some kind of physical

1169
01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:27.040
confrontation or somebody who's going to treat you like a victim.

1170
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.770
Like if somebody wanted your hat,
it was like,
no homie,

1171
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:32.620
you can't have this hat because you ain't pay for it.
Oh,
well give it,

1172
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.880
and that's where we start.

1173
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:38.470
I lived in Jamaica plain for a little over a year and Jamaica plain is the first

1174
01:06:38.471 --> 01:06:43.471
place we moved to Boston and it was a pretty poor and real mixed area and

1175
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.920
Goddamn I how to avoid everybody on my block or I would get my ass kicked.

1176
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.010
Everybody wanted to fight all the time.
All the time.

1177
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:55.060
Kids were always trying to pick fights that always talk shit to you and they're

1178
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:56.650
like,
look,
I'm going home.
Leave me alone.

1179
01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:59.350
And like they're just constantly talking shit with you.
Constantly.

1180
01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:01.840
Fucking when you're big groups of kids,
small groups of kids,

1181
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.660
and when kids are alone,
they're loose like that,

1182
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:06.880
especially in poor neighborhoods.
So they grow up.

1183
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.490
Most of the times they're growing up with your fucking parents or they're not

1184
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:12.520
having the best time.
That's why they were in a,
in a poor neighborhood.

1185
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.250
So it's probably violence at home or screaming and home or chaos at home and

1186
01:07:16.251 --> 01:07:19.400
then these kids are just fucking loose out on the street.
It was,
uh,

1187
01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:22.600
that was like really,
really inspired me to get into martial arts.
I was like,

1188
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:26.020
fuck this man.
This is too dangerous.
And for where I'm going,

1189
01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:29.230
some of them wants a fight.
I don't know how to fucking fight.
Like this is crazy.

1190
01:07:29.231 --> 01:07:31.240
When you got the martial arts,
then you could just call them out.

1191
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:33.460
You had a big group look rather than not men,

1192
01:07:33.461 --> 01:07:36.160
you know the martial arts maybe just walk lap.
No,
no,

1193
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:39.620
but I mean when you're backed into that corner now go find fine.

1194
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.460
I'm saying when you're in that plate,
in that situation,

1195
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:45.190
and there's like eight people talking reckless,
it'd be like,
listen,

1196
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.670
if you're a real man,
why don't we just shoot the five right now?

1197
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:52.990
You shouldn't shoot the five.
What does a,
he's just going one on one,
shoot.

1198
01:07:52.991 --> 01:07:55.900
The five,
shoot the fire,
never heard of that.

1199
01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:58.840
Shoot the five fingers or we get the fair one.
That's what they call it.

1200
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.710
The fair fair one.
The fat one.
I'll be here in the west coast.

1201
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.570
It's catches fade homie.
You know what I mean?
But out there on the east coast,

1202
01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.390
let's shoot the fan one because it's just me and you.

1203
01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.980
While we have a space and opportunity,

1204
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:11.530
I'm amazed at how many dudes are willing to fight that actually don't know how

1205
01:08:11.531 --> 01:08:16.040
to fight.
It's amazing.
When I watched him and I'm like,
that's

1206
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.461
<v 1>incredible.</v>

1207
01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:19.850
You don't even know anything and you're out there scrapping like doing the

1208
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:23.360
windmill out there.
They're doing the windmill,
the throwing ridiculous kicks in.

1209
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:26.270
They have no training at all and you're like,
oh my God,
this is hilarious.

1210
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:29.030
This is like,
yeah,
this is a crazy idea.

1211
01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:32.420
You're willing to do something that's really fucking dangerous and risky and

1212
01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:35.030
you're not good at it at all,
at all,
at all.

1213
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:38.360
I watched a fight go down once in front of the comedy store and it was the Nadia

1214
01:08:38.361 --> 01:08:39.260
Shit I ever saw in my life.

1215
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.380
I saw a guy completely lose his ability to figure out what he was doing.

1216
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:47.900
Like he was so freaked out that he was in a fight with this guy.

1217
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.730
He was a white guy,
black guy,

1218
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:55.230
and the white guy is literally frozen in fear and flailing his arms like this.

1219
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:58.940
I mean he had just was going like this,

1220
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:03.941
like waiting to get hit and a fucking bus moved in front of me and then as the

1221
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:07.220
bus move by,
the dude was laid out,

1222
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.560
stiff leg and even again unconscious and the black dudes were already running

1223
01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:17.380
happy birthday.
Mitzi.
Yeah.
Happy Birthday.
Mitzi.
Is it really her birthday?

1224
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:20.110
How old is she?
Well,
don't be on say a lady doesn't tell.

1225
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:24.020
We're giving shout outs to Mitzi shore to Mitzi.
Shout to Mitzi.

1226
01:09:24.021 --> 01:09:28.520
Shout to my people's up a Neil [inaudible] watching from the east coast snot a

1227
01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:30.200
product and her brother.
You know what I mean?

1228
01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:33.290
I want to send a shout out to the whole rep alarms the whole squad.

1229
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:36.710
This that's watching right now.
Everybody,
Ladies and gentlemen,

1230
01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:39.110
don't go fight in the street.
Even if you do know what you're doing.

1231
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.860
It's the last option.
People got to learn how to chill,
right?

1232
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.960
That's the hard part,
right?
How the fuck does this world evolve?

1233
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:52.060
If we're still involved in all the wars and all the craziness and all that,

1234
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:53.780
how the fuck do we get past this?

1235
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:59.170
The more I look at the life that we see on TV every day and the tragedies that

1236
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:03.770
we see in the news and the horrific things that are going on all over the world,

1237
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:04.850
the more I got,

1238
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:09.850
there's gotta be a way that collectively we can figure out how to stop.

1239
01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:10.790
Most of the shit.

1240
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:16.420
Most of this shit that I'm looking at is people doing shit to other people and

1241
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:18.170
we collectively stop that.

1242
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:22.700
It's almost like because we're not dealing with Ufo woes or asteroids or

1243
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:24.680
anything nutty outside of the earth,

1244
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:30.850
all of our conflicts are being caused by people doing country shit to other

1245
01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:34.640
people.
Like literally the whole world's problem is the whole world.

1246
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.760
The people in the world's problem is the people.
It's,
it's,

1247
01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:41.780
it seems like that should be the easiest thing to solve.

1248
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.470
That should be the easiest thing to figure out.
How to get past.

1249
01:10:45.471 --> 01:10:49.190
It's like we're in like the crazy person that never learned from their crazy

1250
01:10:49.191 --> 01:10:52.640
actions.
It just keeps doing the same stupid shit over and over and over.

1251
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:55.420
Crazy person that doesn't realize they're crazy.
Like most of you.

1252
01:10:55.470 --> 01:11:00.410
Crazy people don't seem to get,
I think what we're talking about here is,

1253
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:05.530
is really the evolution and the d evolution of mankind because we have,

1254
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:10.670
you know,
we're so close,
we haven't the ability to be on other planets almost.

1255
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.310
I mean we have the ability to create these lasers,

1256
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.760
<v 2>these incredible communication devices,
these incredible travel for gene,</v>

1257
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.160
but we have not cured greed.
We haven't cured racism.
We haven't cured,

1258
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.410
you know what I mean?
Jealousy,
anger,

1259
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:30.000
hatred were ruled by these things and people that can control them and know how

1260
01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:33.750
those function within the human mind have more of an ability to control.

1261
01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.380
<v 1>Well,
it's when things get created,</v>

1262
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:40.950
say something spectacular or something destructive.

1263
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.530
The people that are creating that thing,

1264
01:11:43.531 --> 01:11:47.970
then that technology gets put into the hands of people that did not create it.

1265
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:49.530
They just have it now.

1266
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:55.250
And that is always a problem when someone wields something of incredible power

1267
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:59.130
and they didn't even create it.
You know,
you just got it from,

1268
01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:01.530
so do you understand the whole process behind it?

1269
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:05.070
What if you are the type of person that can create that?

1270
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:10.071
Are you the type of person that would be willing to unleash it on people?

1271
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:13.800
I think you'd be more willing to unleash it if you bought it.
You know,

1272
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.180
if you got it from somebody else.

1273
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:20.300
It's just we have the ability to do shit that we don't have the moral evolution

1274
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.520
to cope with.

1275
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:28.730
We have the ability to wipe out like giant sections of the world in like real

1276
01:12:28.861 --> 01:12:32.190
quick blasts and we somehow or another feel like,
you know,

1277
01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:35.250
because we do it a little bit more precisely,
like in Iraq,

1278
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.930
like that's a little bit more precisely.

1279
01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:40.470
You send actual troops in there instead of just dusting the whole area.

1280
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:45.480
It's still a massive amount of casualties and they love to use the same result.

1281
01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:49.440
<v 2>The,
the,
the word,
that catchphrase,
collateral damage,
you know,</v>

1282
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.990
which I think is one of the worst excuses for murder in the world.
It's crazy.

1283
01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.400
It's crazy and the sad part,

1284
01:12:55.710 --> 01:13:00.080
the sad part is the people who catch the blame are always the people on the

1285
01:13:00.081 --> 01:13:04.350
bottom.
The enlisted men,
like even in Abu Ghraib.
When I saw that,
I was like,
oh,

1286
01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.150
okay,
watch.
All the soldiers are going to get some kind of shit to them,

1287
01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:11.480
but the people,
the commanders,
the,
the officer's in charge.

1288
01:13:11.481 --> 01:13:15.530
The people who decided the policy at Dod,
the individuals who were at the,

1289
01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.990
the administration who said,
yeah,
this is fine.

1290
01:13:17.991 --> 01:13:20.990
Do what you need to do to get this.
Those people that gave free range,

1291
01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.460
they always escape.

1292
01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.240
They always seem to have their little exit in the back door while the

1293
01:13:26.241 --> 01:13:31.241
individuals who actually did it and yet bear no responsibility for being told to

1294
01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:35.200
do it or being told,
this is what we're going to do,
or this is the

1295
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.110
<v 1>in the zone.
What happened at noble grape?</v>

1296
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:40.620
I thought it was just a soldier's deciding to be fuckheads and take pictures

1297
01:13:40.621 --> 01:13:42.480
with bodies.
Do you know?
I'm not going to say,

1298
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:46.450
<v 2>I'm not going to say that,
that,
that that isn't part of what happened,</v>

1299
01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.560
but I believe in all of these situations that there was some kind of culture

1300
01:13:50.561 --> 01:13:54.160
within the society that says,
you know what?
If you get caught doing this,

1301
01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:57.830
you're going to do the time for this.
As opposed to whoever is on the top for it.

1302
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.800
It's always benefits of being here.

1303
01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.730
<v 1>So always crazy when a stranger is your enemy.
Okay?</v>

1304
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.960
That doesn't make any sense.
If a stranger is your enemy,
one of two,

1305
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.990
someone's doing something fucked up and see the you were,
it's him.

1306
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.550
You've got to figure out who it is and if you're in his town and you're carrying

1307
01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:19.400
a gun,
then it's you.
You're not supposed to be there.
Like you just said,

1308
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.830
the only way you can get for al Qaeda country that don't have this,

1309
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:25.060
it's just fucking crazy.

1310
01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:28.600
The only way you would have a stranger that's your enemy is if we were in a

1311
01:14:28.601 --> 01:14:30.520
place where he couldn't communicate well,
that's,

1312
01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:33.490
we're not in that place anymore where we're in a totally different world.

1313
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.060
This isn't the world of 10,000 years ago when we show up in a fucking wooden

1314
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:39.970
boat,
he hit the beach and this dude shooting arrows at us,

1315
01:14:39.971 --> 01:14:42.100
we've got to kick some ass.
It's not,
it's,
this is,

1316
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:45.580
this is a totally different world we're living in now.
It doesn't make any sense,

1317
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.750
<v 2>but has humanity and evolve natural.
In other words,</v>

1318
01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:52.200
if we took somebody from now and supplanted them into that era,

1319
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.910
would they simply act the same?

1320
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.790
Or if we took somebody from that era and put them in in now,

1321
01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.500
wouldn't have results simply be the same?

1322
01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.940
<v 1>Um,
I don't know.</v>

1323
01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:03.000
I think I would like to think that we've evolved a little bit or a more,

1324
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:07.500
a larger percentage of us have evolved a little bit because of the Internet,

1325
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:11.550
because of people's abilities to express themselves in a way that,
you know,

1326
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.640
Monsanto didn't really have to hear from the regular people in the 1960s when

1327
01:15:16.831 --> 01:15:19.080
they were making agent orange.
They didn't have to,
he,
you know,

1328
01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.760
there was a protest of the news.

1329
01:15:20.761 --> 01:15:23.070
And if there's not a bunch of people carrying signs,

1330
01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.200
you're not getting anything from the people.
You know what I mean?

1331
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:29.550
It's not like today when people on Twitter would go fucking crazy and,
and any,

1332
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:30.210
any,
uh,

1333
01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:34.170
big story that happens and he'd been corruption store and a big and a boy cat.

1334
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:37.000
She has serious consequences.
And then it was going to say,

1335
01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:42.330
contact this person and you're going to have economic consequences by the end of

1336
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.910
the day.
Which by the way,
is all that they listened to.
Well,
by the way,
today,

1337
01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:49.911
chick filet a Roseanne Barr went off on Chick-Filet because the governor of

1338
01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:53.160
Massachusetts,
God bless his soul,
uh,

1339
01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:57.740
was talking about how chick filet is not welcome in a,
in,

1340
01:15:57.741 --> 01:16:02.030
in Boston because Chick-Filet has this pro.
They some,

1341
01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:05.310
it was something to do with their a idea.

1342
01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:08.110
They have a very religious company apparently.
And uh,

1343
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.900
it has something to do with their ideas and check the light.
Yeah.
They,

1344
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:14.460
they won't even serve on Sunday.
They're closed and it's closed every Sunday.

1345
01:16:14.461 --> 01:16:16.680
They lose millions of dollars every year because of that.

1346
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:20.400
But that's just the way it is.
If you fucking sandwiches a delicious,
you know,

1347
01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:21.960
I made the guy may be naughty with Jesus,

1348
01:16:21.961 --> 01:16:25.500
but he makes a hell of a fucking chicken sandwich,
but apparently bought a good,

1349
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:28.440
or he bought a good recipe once upon could be.
But yeah,
I don't know what it is,

1350
01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.000
but whatever it was,

1351
01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:34.800
whatever the statements from chick filet were addressed by the mayor of Boston,

1352
01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:35.760
I think it was right.

1353
01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.830
It was the mayor of Boston and the governor of Massachusetts.

1354
01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:40.770
I didn't know that either one,
whatever,
whoever the,
I don't know.

1355
01:16:40.771 --> 01:16:42.690
I haven't lived in a long time.
I don't know who's running shit,

1356
01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.560
but whoever's running shit,
uh,
essentially said that they weren't welcome.

1357
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:50.310
You know,
they,
they don't,
uh,
observe same sex marriages.

1358
01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.100
I don't know what the fuck else it was.
You know,
whatever statements.

1359
01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.920
It was kind of funny because people should be allowed to think whenever the fuck

1360
01:16:55.921 --> 01:16:58.660
they want to think.
And who cares?
Just the chicken sandwich place,
you know,

1361
01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:01.230
as long as they're not actively victimizing anybody,

1362
01:17:01.231 --> 01:17:03.090
they can have their nutty beliefs.
You know?

1363
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.670
I think you're allowed to have your nutty beliefs.
Even if you're not,

1364
01:17:05.671 --> 01:17:09.330
he believes,
don't jive with mine.
You're allowed.
You're allowed to have,
you know,

1365
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:10.100
as

1366
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.100
<v 0>long as they're not affecting her,
as long as they're not hurting people.</v>

1367
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:15.550
What the,
but then again,
maybe chick filet is,

1368
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.240
is part of this big Super Pac donors that say we're going to give money to try

1369
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:21.320
effect this legislation.

1370
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.660
Then it becomes different than your opinion is not your opinion.

1371
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.660
Then you're starting to use your money that you get from all of the things that

1372
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:30.410
you have to bolster this opinion and make people believe that your opinion is a

1373
01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:34.130
fact rather than just your fucking opinion gets tricky.
Right.

1374
01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.120
Then we're going to decide.

1375
01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.500
It gets tricky when your profit off distributing your your opinion,
you know,

1376
01:17:40.501 --> 01:17:43.190
and getting people to go along with it just,
well Joe,

1377
01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.510
this is kind of what you and me do.

1378
01:17:44.511 --> 01:17:47.870
We profit by distributing our opinion on and stuff.
Sure,

1379
01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:50.530
but we don't have any influence on,
on,
you know,
um,

1380
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.940
the ability to control countries were very simple.

1381
01:17:56.210 --> 01:18:01.160
Come,
come to a comedy show influence.
No,
very different.
Very different.

1382
01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:06.540
They're suing Batman.
Yeah.
Warner brothers.
The other people involved in the,

1383
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.090
because you know,

1384
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:10.520
I don't want to say anything bad about those poor fucking people,

1385
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.910
but someone apparently had the idea that they can make some money.

1386
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.020
It looks like they're suing them for um,
promoting violence,

1387
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:21.750
which is ridiculous because this was the third movie in a Batman Trilogy.

1388
01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.060
You mean you knew exactly what it is.

1389
01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.000
The fucking whole movie is about a crime fighter.

1390
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.530
And they were saying also that because of the movie they,

1391
01:18:30.531 --> 01:18:31.910
the guy came in and the costume,

1392
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:34.370
they thought he was a part of the movie and it was,
you know,

1393
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.300
they wasn't that more than theaters responsibility cause they was supposed to

1394
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:41.710
close that and they knows man who the fuck knows like somebody who wants to do a

1395
01:18:41.711 --> 01:18:44.210
huge investigation.
But the sad thing is now,
you know,

1396
01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:47.000
people want to know everything.
It's just,

1397
01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:49.750
I see the difference in between the way people are treated and I think it's kind

1398
01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:51.290
of hard to ignore and you know,

1399
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.970
and there's no specific cause right now that they have of his actions.

1400
01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.600
However,
I know what it would be if he had been like,
you know,

1401
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:01.160
he had like a Muslim last name.

1402
01:19:01.161 --> 01:19:03.990
It'd be like automatically he must be a terrorist and this is,
he must,

1403
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:07.610
he killed military personnel.
It must be attack if he,
if he was,

1404
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.050
he's actually scarier.

1405
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.740
He's scary than someone that's a part of some sort of a religious ideology.

1406
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:17.050
Latino,
they'd be like,
college,
these student,
he's an illegal immigrant.

1407
01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.580
Get 'em out of here or a black guy.
He's a gang member.

1408
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:20.870
Rather than just being like,
Hey,

1409
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.010
and I saw that circulating on the Internet and I wonder how real that could

1410
01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:29.090
potentially be even to the fact of him being alive.

1411
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.560
If he was of,
you know,
of complexion that can't make the connection.

1412
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.720
Would he be walking in?
I mean,

1413
01:19:35.721 --> 01:19:38.270
would they want to take him alive when they just be like,
look,
just pop him.

1414
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.860
We don't need somebody like this run through the media.
Just get rid of.

1415
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.050
I think when you get to a situation like that,
there's too many cameras on you.

1416
01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:47.480
You know the reason why they didn't kill that guy where they might have killed

1417
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:49.160
that guy back in the day was out.

1418
01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:51.830
There's too many people with cameras on you and you can get sued for that.

1419
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.990
You know,
you can get sued if somebody has a cell phone camera.

1420
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:57.260
You don't know about it.
You can't just murder the guy right there.
You're fucked.

1421
01:19:57.261 --> 01:19:57.921
Because if you do that,

1422
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:00.320
they'll put you in jail for murder unless you're a cop and you're in the bay

1423
01:20:00.321 --> 01:20:04.880
area because he shot that kid.
Well,
he fucked camp one camp.
He's an idiot.

1424
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.770
He thought that was his taser.
That's stupid.

1425
01:20:06.771 --> 01:20:09.090
Fuck you really think that that's true.
I don't know.
But it,

1426
01:20:09.091 --> 01:20:12.690
Taser is a fucking device with a trigger.
And if you're an idiot,

1427
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.420
if you're a fucking idiot and you're freaking out because you're in the middle

1428
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:18.680
of a physical confrontation with someone and you accidentally pull your gun and

1429
01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:19.650
said,
have your Taser.
I mean,

1430
01:20:19.651 --> 01:20:22.170
I can't think that he thought it would be okay to shoot that guy like that.

1431
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:23.280
That doesn't even make any sense.

1432
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:27.660
It seemed more like a fucking moron move cause the guy was already lying down on

1433
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:29.700
the ground.
He was resisting.
You wouldn't shoot them.
What?

1434
01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:31.660
You already have them down in the ground.
Well,
I mean,

1435
01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:35.430
I mean he was trying to do people do things like that all the time.

1436
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:38.700
They don't think they're going to have consequences.
Well,
if that's the case,

1437
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:41.960
he's a psychopath because it didn't make any sense that he shot him.
Well,
I mean,

1438
01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:45.750
made sense though.
The dye his hair like the,
like the,
like the Nigga who killed,

1439
01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.840
uh,
uh,
do you mean the new,
okay,
we're talking about two separate things.
No,
no,
no,

1440
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:52.350
no.
He did his head to the new guy.
The cop dyed his hair.

1441
01:20:52.351 --> 01:20:55.710
The cop that shot that kid in the subway.
Yeah.
He dyed his hair and he,
he uh,

1442
01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:00.060
he went to like,
uh,
they caught him somewhere else.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh,

1443
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:04.260
I didn't know that.
You mean the cop fled?
Yeah,
he bounced for a little while.
Oh,

1444
01:21:04.261 --> 01:21:07.590
I didn't know God was gone.
Look it up.
Look it up online.
I believe you.

1445
01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:09.150
I didn't know that.
Well,
maybe it's,

1446
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.340
well maybe he just thought he was going to jail for life.

1447
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:13.650
It just fucked up and he panicked.
Who knows?

1448
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.260
But he got a slap on the wrist and I always joke about it.

1449
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:20.700
I joke about it along the skin.
Nothing.
Hardly anything.
Probably.

1450
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:25.350
I think it probably was a mistake.
I don't know.
But it's a terrible mistake.

1451
01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:28.830
The Guy,
the kid ask a grant.
I've mean,

1452
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.860
I can't even imagine how many more people ended up like him within that era

1453
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:39.270
where there was,
like you said,
no cameras when he was,
no,
no.
One day.

1454
01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:43.380
You know how many people applied victim of that?
Yeah,
I know a lot of cops,
man.

1455
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.370
They see the,
one of the problems is you're a cop.
You see a lot of shit,

1456
01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:50.790
see a lot of shit all the time and you lose your patients,
you lose,

1457
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.130
you lose your patients and you,
you know,
you,
you,
you,

1458
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.950
you become more attuned to the kinds of the world then you would like to be and

1459
01:21:57.951 --> 01:22:00.810
you don't want to hear any fucking bullshit anymore.
So very,

1460
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.620
very fucking tricky job.
My,
your humanity.
My question is this,

1461
01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:06.870
now I'm seeing the worst than p being did.

1462
01:22:06.871 --> 01:22:10.980
I know that there are people out there who really do risk their lives.

1463
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:13.620
Like if someone's house is getting robbed or well,

1464
01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:16.590
how about this guy fucking this guy in Denver,
man,
they had it.

1465
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:18.870
Someone had to go in there and stop him.
You know,
this isn't,

1466
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:23.820
this isn't something that you,
you know,
the community could just rally together.

1467
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.870
No one had guns.

1468
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:29.900
But my question is the police that break the law [inaudible] should they be held

1469
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:35.250
more accountable because they know the law that much better?
Like in other words,

1470
01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:40.251
if had killed somebody or should you get time to minimize?

1471
01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:42.900
For example,
there's a case in in New York where a guy,

1472
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:47.340
he got like a a year of probation or something or was it a year in one year in

1473
01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:51.540
jail because he killed a guy while he was drunk driving and he's,

1474
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:55.340
he's his family is apparently connected with the NYP ds.

1475
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.500
This is my question though.
If if you're a cop,

1476
01:22:58.501 --> 01:23:03.180
shouldn't you be held accountable to the law even more so because you knew it

1477
01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:05.980
was wrong to be drunk and driving.
You arrested probably a hundred

1478
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.070
<v 2>times to doing the same thing.</v>

1479
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:12.340
<v 1>Thank that it's ever been shown that to put people in a situation where it's</v>

1480
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:15.400
whatever they're doing that's wrong has more of a consequence.

1481
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:18.460
I don't think that's ever been shown to him.
It have any effect on their actions.

1482
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.190
I think people do shit cause they think they're going to get away with it.

1483
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:24.520
They don't do shit because they measure the consequence and go,
all right,

1484
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.730
I might do a year in jail.
Fuck it,
let's ride.
They don't do it like that there.

1485
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:32.350
It's,
it's more of an impulsive sort of a thing when,
when people make

1486
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:34.290
<v 2>mistakes,
but if people know,
listen,</v>

1487
01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:38.430
there's no way that I'm really going to catch it that much heat for this because

1488
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.260
who the fuck is,
right?

1489
01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.790
If I'm drunk and somebody pulls me over and we both play for the same team,

1490
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:47.550
you're going to bring me in.
You know what's going to happen to you after that?

1491
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:52.950
<v 1>Really crazy is how many cops turned out to be corrupt back in the days before</v>

1492
01:23:52.951 --> 01:23:56.970
the Internet.
I mean,
I think it's very difficult to be corrupt today,
but I think,

1493
01:23:56.971 --> 01:23:59.420
uh,
back in the day it was probably pretty fun

1494
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:03.160
<v 2>and easy.
I'm just saying,
I think it's slightly less difficult to be corrupt.</v>

1495
01:24:03.161 --> 01:24:07.060
I mean,
I think you can if,
if there's money in it for you,
you know,

1496
01:24:07.061 --> 01:24:09.910
and I think there's levels of corruption,
there's harmful levels,

1497
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.840
and then there's simple stuff like,
you know what?
I'll fix it.
Tickets for you.

1498
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:17.150
You know,
we're good friends.
That's corruption.
Whether or not it's,

1499
01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:18.880
it's bad in people's kids are dying.

1500
01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:21.460
Someone shouldn't have the ability to do that.
They say,
you know what,

1501
01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:24.880
you're connected with me.
I'll give you the card when you have a problem,

1502
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:28.780
you call me and I take care of it.
I know people that benefit from that.

1503
01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:33.340
I know people that had been in situations where they may not be 100% right and

1504
01:24:33.341 --> 01:24:36.910
they have a specific card or something like that,

1505
01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:41.540
and I'm not denigrating this thing.
I'm just saying that at some point,
you know,

1506
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:45.700
are you more responsible for your corruption because you know the law 10 times

1507
01:24:45.701 --> 01:24:48.550
better and you're enforcing it and forcing it.
In other words,

1508
01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:53.260
if you get caught for murder and and then you're off all of a sudden in five

1509
01:24:53.261 --> 01:24:57.490
years,
that's only because you knew the law better and then you still broke it.

1510
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:59.110
Well,
we was selling drugs.

1511
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.270
<v 1>Like I said,
I don't think that you can,</v>

1512
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.700
you make people more responsive when you're going to change anything.

1513
01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:06.130
You might make people feel better because you're punishing them more,

1514
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:09.520
but I don't think you're necessarily going to change behavior by offering a

1515
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:13.360
bigger consequence.
I think the only way to change behaviors to change thinking,

1516
01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:17.470
and what I try to tell people is,
and it sounds ridiculous,

1517
01:25:17.471 --> 01:25:19.420
but this is something that came to me on a boat once,

1518
01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.750
is that you got to treat everybody as if it's you live in another life.

1519
01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.580
We could all do that.
We could all do that.
If we could all picture ev,

1520
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:31.450
any person,
regardless of what the fuck they're going through in your life,

1521
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:36.010
think about what it would be like to live that person's life from birth to death

1522
01:25:36.011 --> 01:25:40.630
with their situation,
their economic situation,
their biological situation there,

1523
01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.200
their life experiences.
Would you be any different than that person?

1524
01:25:44.201 --> 01:25:47.950
If you are that man,
if you were that woman,
would you be any different?

1525
01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:52.780
Are you them?
You know,
if that person was born you,
would they be you?

1526
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:54.550
And Are we all the same like that?

1527
01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:59.551
And is that what life really is all about is figuring out that each one of us is

1528
01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:03.250
exactly the same.
We're just living through a different biological circumstance.

1529
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:07.030
And the more you can treat everyone you meet,
like there,

1530
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.030
you living another life,
the happier you'll be.

1531
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:15.380
And that's the only way we're ever going to sort this thing out is everyone has

1532
01:26:15.381 --> 01:26:18.900
to do things based on that ideal everyone had,

1533
01:26:18.901 --> 01:26:22.160
whether it's business or personal shit.
Whatever you do,

1534
01:26:22.161 --> 01:26:26.420
you always have to think that this person that you're dealing with is you living

1535
01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:29.720
another life and you can't let them boss you around.

1536
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.450
Can't let them talk shit to you.
Can't let them fuck up your life.

1537
01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.030
You know you do your best to keep them on track,

1538
01:26:35.031 --> 01:26:37.460
but your ethic and your resolve and your,

1539
01:26:37.461 --> 01:26:41.750
your intent should always be to treat them as if it was you living a whole

1540
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:42.430
nother last year.

1541
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:45.920
Somebody who hates yourself and then that's just what you gotta get your shit

1542
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:50.180
together,
son.
That's a whole nother fucking people up like I fucking agent.
Well,

1543
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:53.910
they just closed down all these medical marijuana dispensaries in California,
uh,

1544
01:26:53.911 --> 01:26:56.540
or they just sent a letter in Los Angeles.

1545
01:26:56.541 --> 01:27:01.130
Los Angeles has decided to step in in their infinite wisdom and shutdown the

1546
01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:03.260
only businesses that are regularly making money.

1547
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:06.590
All of Los Angeles so stupid.

1548
01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.540
It's so fucking dummies.
The first American Fletcher is made of hemp.

1549
01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.090
Yeah.
I'm one real shit.

1550
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.800
When the drafts of the declaration of Independence was written on hand,

1551
01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:20.380
but mean who cares about all that stuff?
The idea of that.
You know why?

1552
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:23.390
Because I think it takes the story back and it shows us,
listen,

1553
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:26.690
people made their clothes out of this.
People did everything look right,

1554
01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:28.500
but that's not even the psychoactive stuff.

1555
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:32.870
We live in a culture now where the smoke that causes cancer is legal and the

1556
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:35.090
smoke that cures cancer is illegal.

1557
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:38.300
It doesn't necessarily cure cancer,

1558
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:41.540
but it certainly reduces what I'm just saying,
that by the way,
Tommy Chong,

1559
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.250
for all the people that listen to the podcast,

1560
01:27:43.251 --> 01:27:47.330
Tommy Chong is 99% cancer free now.
She just started these,

1561
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:51.820
God bless has been doing this,
a hemp oil stuff and uh,
it's a,
there's,

1562
01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:55.010
Rick Simpson is the guy who invented this hemp oil apparently is just really

1563
01:27:55.011 --> 01:28:00.011
potent form of under the oil from cannabis and it puts you on the fucking moon

1564
01:28:00.711 --> 01:28:03.750
and in the process of shrinks tumors.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

1565
01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.490
congratulations to our friend Tommy Chong.
That's a,
that's awesome news.

1566
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.210
Congratulations.
Amazing that this guy did it with no chemotherapy.

1567
01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:13.460
He did it with holistic medicine,

1568
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:16.940
meaning vitamins and food and not meaning like anything crazy like sucking on

1569
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:21.620
crystals,
make it all noises,
holistic meaning treating the body as a whole,

1570
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:25.450
giving it nutrients,
giving you a cheeky does what I do every morning as a,

1571
01:28:25.451 --> 01:28:27.530
a Kale shake,
you know,
and uh,

1572
01:28:27.531 --> 01:28:32.220
which is a lot of people have been doing this and if you're down for health and

1573
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.260
vitality,
man,

1574
01:28:33.261 --> 01:28:37.790
there's very few things in life better than a really fucking thick,

1575
01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:42.050
heavy nutrient dense vegetable shake in the morning.

1576
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:45.140
And it does not taste good.
I'm not going to fucking lie to you.

1577
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:49.040
I chew this shit down every day and every day I think about finding a way to

1578
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:53.030
pussy out of this,
like on Mantras,
have some bacon and eggs.
Fuck this,

1579
01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.270
but I don't.
I drink this God damn awful concoction.

1580
01:28:56.930 --> 01:29:00.260
I was feeling like a little bit sick when I came back from Canada the other day

1581
01:29:00.261 --> 01:29:03.060
and a lot of traveling shit.
I drank the shit one day.

1582
01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:06.540
By the end of the day I felt great.
That's never happened.

1583
01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:10.530
Every time I get a cold,
by the end of the day,
I'm ready to go to sleep.

1584
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:14.670
I'm fighting this off.
I got to take a hot bath the next day.
You know,

1585
01:29:14.671 --> 01:29:18.330
it takes like a day to fight off a cold.
By the end of the day it was done

1586
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.870
because I'm eating nutrient dense shit bitches.
Okay?
I go,

1587
01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.590
I go crazy with it.
My latest thing.
I add coconut oil to it because Rob Wolf,

1588
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:29.430
who will be on tomorrow,

1589
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.570
the author of the Paleo Diet said that in order for you to get maximum

1590
01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:36.060
absorption of the vitamins from plants,

1591
01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:39.540
you should have them with some fat and the way the human body works,

1592
01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:40.470
you should have a little bit of fat.

1593
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.050
So I started adding coconut oil to that shit.

1594
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:48.051
Son and coconut oil has been known to help people who have Alzheimer's disease.

1595
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:53.130
There's a some sort of a connection between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes

1596
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:54.280
that it's almost like a,

1597
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.320
a sort of a cousin of diabetes for the brain or something like that and they're,

1598
01:29:58.321 --> 01:30:01.920
they're having positive results.
Giving a Alzheimer's patients coconut oil.

1599
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.680
Coconut is a wonderful fucking plant.

1600
01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.940
What an amazing resource coconuts are.
It tastes delicious.

1601
01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:13.050
You can eat the meat of it,
you drink it,
there's oil in it,

1602
01:30:13.051 --> 01:30:15.120
it's great for you.
This fucking there.

1603
01:30:15.121 --> 01:30:17.820
You can't think anything better for rehydrating and coconut milk.

1604
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:22.680
The water from coconuts is the shit too.
Oh,
butters is there.

1605
01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:24.450
Coconut butter.
Coconut butter is good.

1606
01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:28.470
And my favorite candy bar of all time is a almond joy because it has coconut

1607
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.590
almond joy.
Is the almonds alone.
Good enough?
Nope.

1608
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:36.000
Need some coconuts back that shit up.
You know,
it's what it is.
Mars.

1609
01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:39.420
Mars is even better than I have preferred Maras over Almond Joy.

1610
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.850
But it's tough to just find Mars.

1611
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:43.950
<v 2>Damn.
You don't even,
I found out last night,
Joe,</v>

1612
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:46.860
you're going to freak out about this thing about,
I won't down the street,

1613
01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:51.250
maybe a mile that way.
And here's a Roscoe chicken and biscuits or whatever.

1614
01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.350
I didn't know that.
Yeah,
you didn't know that.
No Dude,

1615
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:58.570
they opened one in [inaudible] boy.
Yeah,
go.

1616
01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:02.940
Whenever we do rock the bells were going to do a tour and I'm an August,

1617
01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:06.480
I'm gonna be back here on the west coast and I got a big show,
um,

1618
01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:10.710
in San Bernardino and then I have one on a San Diego,

1619
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.940
Ventura,
San Luis Obispo,
Fresno and on that.

1620
01:31:14.941 --> 01:31:17.300
But whenever all the dudes come in,
that's the first thing.

1621
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:21.600
<v 1>Roscoe's tutor Roscoe's man,
it's tough to beat that combination.
They nailed it,</v>

1622
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:25.140
man.
And that chicken is the best fucking fried chicken you will ever have.

1623
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:27.870
It's not just,
it's fried,
just fried chicken or just waffles.

1624
01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:31.080
The waffles are perfect.
They're goddamn American waffles.
Okay,

1625
01:31:31.081 --> 01:31:34.110
Ladies and gentlemen,
not this Belgium bullshit.
It's big fat,

1626
01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:38.490
fluffy fucking loaves of bread that you're soaking up the syrup with.
No,

1627
01:31:38.491 --> 01:31:43.491
it's a Goddamn flat waffle and American waffle with some bad ass fried chicken.

1628
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:48.090
You can't fuck with Roscoe's are too good.
I like it.
Especially with hot sauce.

1629
01:31:48.091 --> 01:31:49.230
That chicken with hot sauce.

1630
01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:53.770
<v 2>I always say,
listen,
if if they opened one in New York,
they would make a killing,</v>

1631
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:56.780
<v 1>killing it would crush it.
They would crush it.</v>

1632
01:31:56.781 --> 01:31:59.890
There would be lines out the door every day.
Same with in and out,
man.

1633
01:31:59.891 --> 01:32:01.270
If in and out got to New York,

1634
01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.270
you know there's some people on the west coast that have figured some shit out.

1635
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:05.980
Chicken and waffles and in and out burger

1636
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:09.650
<v 2>to then end and the cannabis dispensaries to hit</v>

1637
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:12.890
<v 1>well.
Yeah,
but meanwhile they're these concert clothes and I'm here.</v>

1638
01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.970
It's so crazy.
It's like in mid mom,
if he gets an office,

1639
01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:21.050
a court for this or that,
just they started the,
I don't know,
they just,

1640
01:32:21.051 --> 01:32:24.780
they made a statement today.
They ruled off somebodies got a,

1641
01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:28.670
so this is a city council ruled,
right?
Is that what it was?

1642
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:30.440
But when I don't understand is how,

1643
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:33.080
how they can just do that because there's a lot of these people,

1644
01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:36.560
our families and this is their family business now and they've invested so much

1645
01:32:36.561 --> 01:32:38.530
time and money and they,
they've,

1646
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:42.380
they were allowed doing it because they have power and that they didn't earn.

1647
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:45.740
They don't deserve it.
They're dumb cunts.
That's why they're doing it.

1648
01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:49.370
They're idiots.
The idea that it's hurting anybody's preposterous.

1649
01:32:49.371 --> 01:32:52.220
So the idea that you're protecting people from anything is ridiculous.

1650
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:56.600
What are you doing?
What are you doing that's good for the common welfare?

1651
01:32:56.601 --> 01:32:58.550
What are you doing?
It's good for the community.

1652
01:32:58.551 --> 01:33:03.050
It's what you're doing is absolutely a logical and based on a false pretense.

1653
01:33:03.051 --> 01:33:05.900
And that is that there's something wrong with taking cannabis.

1654
01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.690
There's nothing wrong with it.
There's nothing wrong with it health wise.

1655
01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.400
There's nothing wrong with it.

1656
01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:15.530
And there's no one's getting victimized by it is no addictive properties to it.

1657
01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:19.910
I don't give a fuck what doctor drew says,
marijuana is not physically addictive.

1658
01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:23.380
And if you get addicted to pot,
you could get addicted to any who said that?

1659
01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.320
Doctor drill.
You could get addicted to beaten off.

1660
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:29.240
You can get it playing with your eyelids.

1661
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.120
There's people that are addicted to plucking hairs out of their arms.
Okay.

1662
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:35.060
That doesn't mean that plucking Harris out of your arms should be illegal.

1663
01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:38.990
What is the fucking stupid as people are broken bitches.
This is the other thing.

1664
01:33:38.991 --> 01:33:39.190
Yeah.

1665
01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:43.920
<v 2>I,
I can't drive a car when I'm drunk.
I wouldn't try.
Um,</v>

1666
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.170
but I could definitely drive very safely when you're high.
If I'm bleeding,
yeah,

1667
01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.880
there's,
there's certain things you can do.
You know what I mean?

1668
01:33:51.881 --> 01:33:54.070
And there are certain things you just cannot,

1669
01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.020
<v 1>well,
I don't like to drive high,
but I could do it if I had to.</v>

1670
01:33:58.021 --> 01:34:02.670
I do Jujitsu high all day.
I do it all the time.
It's no problem.
I kickbox hi.

1671
01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:05.490
It's like,
it feels natural to me.
It doesn't bother me.

1672
01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:08.820
I don't like learning new techniques when I'm high.
I like training.

1673
01:34:08.850 --> 01:34:12.510
I like what if rolling or I'm hitting the mitts or something like that.

1674
01:34:12.511 --> 01:34:14.450
I liked doing that when I'm high,
but if I was like someone,

1675
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:17.070
someone's trying to teach me some new way to throw a kick or someone that I

1676
01:34:17.071 --> 01:34:20.550
wouldn't want to do with it,
you know?
Then I want to have all my faculties.

1677
01:34:20.551 --> 01:34:23.550
I don't want to be distracted.
But when you know what you're there to do,

1678
01:34:23.551 --> 01:34:25.800
you could,
you get high,
you just get into that groove.

1679
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.130
There's no physical repercussions of it.
I'd have no,
and again,

1680
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.040
slowing and my reflexes are moving.
Just to clarify,

1681
01:34:32.041 --> 01:34:35.280
I'm not advising that people get high and I'm advising the people get high and

1682
01:34:35.290 --> 01:34:40.200
do Jujitsu.
I'm not advising people get get high and drive,

1683
01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.830
but if you want to get high and do Jujitsu or do something that I swear to God

1684
01:34:43.831 --> 01:34:48.450
it knocks my Jujitsu up a notch.
Yeah,
I believe so.
I believe so.
You know,

1685
01:34:48.451 --> 01:34:53.070
I think even with the delay,
there's no delayed reaction time.
That's what silly.

1686
01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.540
You know,
people,
first of all,
people are getting that indigo.

1687
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.040
We'd learned that into Kuwait is all over

1688
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.400
<v 0>the east coast.
Very hard for you guys to get sativa because you guys aren't,</v>

1689
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:03.860
you aren't a illegal environment in California.
It's legal.

1690
01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:08.861
So they figured out a way to grow the more psychoactively potent strains of uh,

1691
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.290
uh,
of Sativa,
like a train wreck and you know,

1692
01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:16.040
there's a green crack and it's the one called the sage that were smoking right

1693
01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:19.820
now these things are fucking Carl Sagan,
weed man,

1694
01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.770
cosmos type Shit.

1695
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:25.460
This is not the kind of weed that makes you like sink into the couch and the

1696
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:28.890
kind of way that you get on the,
on the east coast.
We don't all get that.

1697
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:33.740
We don't all get bad.
It's not bad weed,
bro.
I mean,
not saying I like west coast.

1698
01:35:33.741 --> 01:35:37.160
We'd,
I did.
No,
no,
no.
I'm not even saying that west coast we'd,

1699
01:35:37.161 --> 01:35:38.810
there's a lot of great west coast.

1700
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.930
Endeca when I was saying is you don't get too much sativa.

1701
01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:45.710
Then in the end it goes great.
It's hard to get.

1702
01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.430
It's harder to get and it's hard to know for sure that the guy you're selling it

1703
01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.320
you're selling to is legit.
Whereas I can go to a dispensary,
you know,

1704
01:35:54.321 --> 01:35:57.710
and just walk into a place and they have the exact strength still Ken,

1705
01:35:57.711 --> 01:36:00.020
where I live,
dude,
I don't live in La.
It takes off.
It takes,

1706
01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:01.400
it takes the violence side of it.

1707
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:04.530
We're taking the violence out of the drug trade by doing that,

1708
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:08.870
taking the creepy people out.
We're taking,
we're putting tax on something.

1709
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.840
You're making money.
It's an American pastime.

1710
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:14.150
Half the founding fathers were high.

1711
01:36:14.410 --> 01:36:17.270
They were probably high when they were writing the declaration of independence

1712
01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.790
and the constitution.
Yeah.
I hope they weren't there.
Would,

1713
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:22.150
it would have been a better piece of literature as well.

1714
01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:23.240
That's probably why it's so good.

1715
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:25.580
They were high as fuck when they were high and shit like,
Yo,
what should we do?

1716
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:28.490
What should we do?
And then like the assholes among them.
We're like,
hey,

1717
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.220
let's put in,
uh,

1718
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.960
all men should be free and then let's just have slavery instead like fucking

1719
01:36:33.961 --> 01:36:36.740
hell.
It's amazing that we haven't like wroten written a new one.

1720
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.890
Like how about we get together and decide like as a fucking race,

1721
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.030
what's the best thing we could do for the race and we should have all of our

1722
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:46.860
guidelines and everything agreed upon by you know,

1723
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:48.380
the intelligent people of the world.

1724
01:36:48.381 --> 01:36:52.100
We should have it not based on who's in power and who's in control and can they

1725
01:36:52.101 --> 01:36:54.320
manipulate that and make money.
It should really,

1726
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:57.830
all of our rules are how society's done should be for the betterment of

1727
01:36:57.831 --> 01:37:02.750
improving our society.
But it's not.
It's not because there's constant power.

1728
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:06.920
They're not sacrificing themselves and their own pleasure and their own profit.

1729
01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:11.450
In order to help you and aid you got to look at it as if everybody is,

1730
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:16.451
you live in another life or even teach them to do that or even in terms of of

1731
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:19.790
getting a profit nowadays.
What is that?
It's a digital salary.

1732
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:22.660
It's a bunch of numbers in the computer or I need your sack of gold.

1733
01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.740
Fucking deers balls.
Dear ball sack with gold coins in it.

1734
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:30.530
You mother fucker.
I told them,
cause when I was coming here I was like,
Yo man,

1735
01:37:30.531 --> 01:37:34.430
I hope that this mother fucker don't do nothing crazy.
What they'll pull out.

1736
01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:37.850
No Elk,
penis,
no fucking crazy fear factor shit.

1737
01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:43.260
Shit.
These people always say that you got any bugs on you?
Hey Martin,

1738
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.220
what do you think?
Killed Biggie.
Oh man,
that's crazy out there.
And you Brian.

1739
01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:50.980
All right.
Ah,
ask everyone are up in east coast,
west coast.
No,
no.

1740
01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.710
You know what's funny?
I,
I have a lot,
a lot of,
uh,

1741
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.440
<v 2>support on the east coast because that's where I'm from.</v>

1742
01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:02.190
But this is probably one of the places in like in la where I could do a bigger

1743
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:03.870
show than I could in New York.

1744
01:38:03.871 --> 01:38:07.770
I think it's just because New York is like 10 cities put together and La is like

1745
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.270
20 cities.
But it's also,

1746
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:12.320
they probably appreciate you more when you're not at all the time.
You know,

1747
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:16.560
it's just natural.
You know,
if you're,
you're used to doing shows in New York,

1748
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:19.410
everybody's like,
oh,
mortal technique,
he's here all the time,
all the time.

1749
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.330
When you get out to la,
they're like,
oh shit,
he's here,

1750
01:38:21.331 --> 01:38:22.980
but I have a lot of family.
I'm always out here.

1751
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:27.720
You just become a notorious and famous and norm or everything you've achieved
is,

1752
01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.930
I'm pretty much through the Internet.
Um,
a lot of it.
Yeah.

1753
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:35.310
But I think in the very beginning it had to do with me going to specific places

1754
01:38:35.311 --> 01:38:39.210
and not just playing the big towns but playing all the small places around.

1755
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.210
You think you built it up like a sort of a grassroots thing?

1756
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.820
I through the Internet,

1757
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:48.960
this business I learned his business from not only from people who were involved

1758
01:38:48.961 --> 01:38:51.750
in it,
but also like in terms of performers,

1759
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:54.750
but I also learned the business from a lot of old school,

1760
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.230
Italian and Jewish gangsters that ran the game back in the day and we're like,

1761
01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:00.660
hey listen,
let me just break it down for you young brother,

1762
01:39:00.661 --> 01:39:03.750
like in the 1930 [inaudible] the Jewish guy and talking to you like that.

1763
01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.000
We could have been,
hey,
let me break this fucking down fees.

1764
01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:10.410
That would bother you then.
Shit ever bothered the shit out of me.

1765
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.750
We had to kill Biggie for a reason.
No,
no,
no.

1766
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:15.440
I've been an old Jewish Jews brother.
I'm like,
oh,

1767
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.560
they were very,
very,
and these are friends and family,

1768
01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:21.390
so it's not like they're sitting here playing a game with me.

1769
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:25.950
They're just being very honest.
They're like,
look in in the 1930s and forties,

1770
01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:29.910
um,
people are African American,

1771
01:39:29.911 --> 01:39:32.400
didn't have the opportunity to petition in court.
I mean you didn't eat meat,

1772
01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:33.300
have civil rights.

1773
01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:36.360
So when you're dealing with people who are trying to rob you and jerk you in

1774
01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:39.270
terms of these promoters,
they needed some muscle for their hustle.

1775
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:43.110
So it's different for them to be like,
hey man,
can I have my money please?

1776
01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:43.950
Or it like,

1777
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:49.980
oh Louis Armstrong like $60,000 and you're going to give me an ivy over here,

1778
01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:53.790
an extra 10 for coming down here and having a fuck you up or you're not going to

1779
01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:56.940
have any legs in a little while.
Who the fuck are you going to call the cops?

1780
01:39:56.941 --> 01:39:58.680
When they used to have to do in the music business,

1781
01:39:58.681 --> 01:40:01.130
it was about getting money for the theaters.

1782
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.960
No getting money from individuals shaking people down,

1783
01:40:03.961 --> 01:40:05.550
getting every last dollar that they could.

1784
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:09.630
That's why business is run like a hustle.
It's run on some gangster shit.

1785
01:40:09.631 --> 01:40:11.340
If you look at the contract,
for example,

1786
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.950
the one that used to be prevalent rather than three 60 deal,

1787
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.020
you have a point system where you're basically given like,
you know,
10 15 points,

1788
01:40:19.021 --> 01:40:23.400
which technically means you get 10 cents off of every dollar that comes in.

1789
01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.930
So 10 points is a percent.

1790
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:31.340
So the stuff you pay back in terms of the loan doesn't come out of the gross.

1791
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.800
It comes down to come.
It doesn't even come out of the net.

1792
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.180
It comes out of that 10%.
It's the most gangsta shit in the world.
It's a wow.

1793
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:43.650
10% comes all of the uh,

1794
01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:47.910
Trower today traveling.
That's ridiculous.

1795
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:52.890
The amount of,
uh,
of studio time evenly distributed between everybody,
right,

1796
01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:54.010
exactly.
Only goes

1797
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.730
<v 0>to the artists.
To me.
It wasn't just that,
but they also told me,
listen,</v>

1798
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.940
if you want to survive and have longevity in this game than do it,

1799
01:41:00.941 --> 01:41:03.190
the old school rock and roll way,
forget this,

1800
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:07.510
this mix tape craze that was hitting during the,
the,
the,
the mid two thousands.

1801
01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:11.940
They said what you need to do is Tor,
Tor,
Tor,
tor nonstop go everywhere.

1802
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:16.780
Never turned down a show.
So what did you,
uh,
were just starting us off?

1803
01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:18.870
Where'd you look to start doing rap?
Uh,

1804
01:41:19.230 --> 01:41:21.790
I mean I could rom ever since I was about like nine years old,

1805
01:41:21.791 --> 01:41:23.800
but I didn't really take it seriously.
Um,

1806
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:26.890
like in terms of trying to put things together and puts like actual,

1807
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.420
like around when I was five,
I did some doctor Seuss.
The Pixel put some real,

1808
01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.600
no,
but I,
when I was young,
I tried to ride,

1809
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.340
I'll try to write like little songs or oh,
little verses.

1810
01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.720
And then I think when I got out of prison I decided,
you know what,

1811
01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:44.050
I'm going to take all these songs that I wrote while I was incarcerated and I'm

1812
01:41:44.051 --> 01:41:46.660
going to,
I'm going to really record them and I'm going to put them down.

1813
01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:48.250
I'm going to find instrumentals.

1814
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:51.280
And I went about it and I started winning a lot of these MC battles.

1815
01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:53.480
They still have them one now.
They have like uh,

1816
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.980
some companies that run them smack and you know what's funny man,

1817
01:41:56.981 --> 01:41:59.230
when dudes lose their hat and punched the other guy,

1818
01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:00.790
have you seen some of that shit?

1819
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.110
I know a lot of people that have done things like that.
We,
we,

1820
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:09.160
we shun those things in New York now.
They built a strong empire.

1821
01:42:09.161 --> 01:42:12.250
We vetch if you sucker punch of guy where the guy's going off on new year,

1822
01:42:12.251 --> 01:42:13.084
a weak bitch.

1823
01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:16.870
If somebody's getting in your face and like literally like touching your face,

1824
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:19.300
you've crossed the line.
That is true.

1825
01:42:19.301 --> 01:42:23.830
But there is some shit that someone could say that they deserve to get cracked.

1826
01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:26.860
Like,
if someone's talking shit about your mother or you know,

1827
01:42:26.861 --> 01:42:30.200
or especially if whole point in a battle scene did a battle scene.

1828
01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:35.110
Now there's nothing that's off limits.
Yeah,
but it should be.
No,

1829
01:42:35.111 --> 01:42:37.720
and I knew he was gonna Punch you.
That's,
I feel like his mom dies.

1830
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:39.640
But that's it talks the best.
Mom Joe,

1831
01:42:39.641 --> 01:42:43.420
this is the difference between how it is now and how it was back in the day when

1832
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:47.470
I was around still doing these battles in the late nineties early 2000 and it

1833
01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:49.690
really only in the early 2000 is it on video.

1834
01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:53.980
All the other stuff was just street battles.
If you set something in a battle,

1835
01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:58.570
you had to be prepared to back it up afterwards.
Whereas now you could say,

1836
01:42:58.571 --> 01:43:00.040
I'm going to murder you,
I'm going to kick you out.

1837
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.580
And then after the battle people shake hands and no mention of what's actually

1838
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:08.410
transpired.
So in the old days it was more real.
Yes,
it was more than a murder.

1839
01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:12.550
Someone they might fucking shoot you when you are all here in a big cipher back

1840
01:43:12.551 --> 01:43:15.040
in like 1997 or something.

1841
01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:17.590
And one of us on someone tried to jump into cipher.

1842
01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:20.710
Somebody would test that person like,
what the fuck are you doing here?

1843
01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:24.970
And start battling them and whether or not they were successful or even held

1844
01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:28.660
their own in the battle,
they could stay in the Cypher.
It was more exclusive.

1845
01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:31.960
People booed the shit out of you before and we're not scared to.

1846
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:35.500
Whereas now they're like,
oh yeah,
well he tried,
you know,
no,

1847
01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:38.680
fuck you get off stage in New York was just the worst.

1848
01:43:38.730 --> 01:43:41.380
Have you ever heard of Pete Spratt?
Do you know what Pete Sprout is?

1849
01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:45.850
That name is familiar and he's a bad ass rapper who's also a badass mixed

1850
01:43:45.851 --> 01:43:49.630
martial arts fighter.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
He fought in the UFC a few times.

1851
01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:54.050
He's a fought and MFC.
Fun Bunch of different organizations,

1852
01:43:54.051 --> 01:43:58.700
but he's a sick Muay Thai fighter.
He's a but just bad ass.
Kickboxer very,

1853
01:43:58.701 --> 01:44:02.160
very dangerous dude.
But he's also a rapper.
It was like a rapper.
Yeah,

1854
01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:02.911
it was like Doh.

1855
01:44:02.911 --> 01:44:07.911
Last dude that you want to talk shit to in a fucking rap battle is Pete Spratt.

1856
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:12.410
That motherfucker will leg kick you into oblivion.
I found her old rap battle.

1857
01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.010
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1858
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:32.900
<v 0>When you're doing this is all like ad libbing is pretty much freestyling.</v>

1859
01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:36.270
You know what I mean?
You,
you have shit that you like go to like go to things.

1860
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:41.220
I think every rapper has an emergency line but back in the day it really was

1861
01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:43.230
really,
really like very spontaneous.

1862
01:44:43.231 --> 01:44:46.890
It was off the top of the head as they refer to it freestyling off the top of

1863
01:44:46.891 --> 01:44:49.320
the head
I think.

1864
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:53.430
And then I think at some point nowadays all the battle rap that we see now,

1865
01:44:53.431 --> 01:44:57.940
Joe is all very much choreographed.
Like in other words you and I,
it's,

1866
01:44:57.990 --> 01:45:01.620
it's run more the where the UFC would be where you and I know our opponent

1867
01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:05.790
months ahead of time,
we train for his style.
I see you and I say,
you know what?

1868
01:45:05.791 --> 01:45:09.180
His style is to find angles and personal lines about people.

1869
01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:12.930
I know what his weaknesses are.
I need to find it.
Whereas back in the day,

1870
01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:17.340
you would come in a room and the the wall would just be wall to wall MCS and

1871
01:45:17.341 --> 01:45:20.400
they would call to people to come in the middle that didn't even know each
other.

1872
01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.850
And then like you said before,
you were at war with a stranger.
I don't know.

1873
01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:27.510
It just,
they tell you that old battle rapping in 10 minutes,

1874
01:45:28.170 --> 01:45:31.580
settle it all Jujitsu,
stop shutting it down,

1875
01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:36.240
lay down some mats,
shut the fuck up.
But at the same pair of shorts,

1876
01:45:36.241 --> 01:45:40.920
put a tee shirt on,
ready,
try to kill each other to shut up.
But it's a war.

1877
01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:43.800
But that's the whole point.
It's a war.
It's a war of words.
You know what I mean?

1878
01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:46.560
Yeah.
But it's more of insults,

1879
01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.320
like personal insults at some point,

1880
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:53.460
I think if you don't make the insults clever and there is no technique to them,

1881
01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.550
right.
And there's no metaphor and it becomes anything because you wouldn't,

1882
01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.130
you wouldn't.

1883
01:45:57.130 --> 01:46:00.500
And anybody else could have a slug fest in a street and eventually somebody's

1884
01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:03.510
going to win.
But there's no technique.
There's no,
there's no

1885
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:06.690
in your wraps period.

1886
01:46:06.691 --> 01:46:11.040
Isn't it better to do that than to do it in some sort of a fucking silly battle

1887
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:12.720
situation?
We insulting each other.

1888
01:46:12.721 --> 01:46:16.910
I think to me battling is something that refined and the,

1889
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:20.160
the way that I,
I did rap and just to clarify,

1890
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:23.460
there's a big difference between the way it was and the way it is now,
Joe.

1891
01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:28.260
The way it was was that the winner got to come back and perform at the next one.

1892
01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.140
You have to win two battles.

1893
01:46:31.141 --> 01:46:34.620
The first one was against your opponents and there would be several in the same

1894
01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:35.640
night you would have a pen.

1895
01:46:35.641 --> 01:46:39.180
Then you got to come back and perform your songs and music,

1896
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:41.610
so you had to prove yourself twice.

1897
01:46:41.611 --> 01:46:45.960
The first time was against the other and the other one was against the crowd and

1898
01:46:45.961 --> 01:46:50.010
nowadays what's been taken out of the Joe is that advancement,
somebodies career

1899
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.350
<v 2>that that work that puts in that says,
you know what?</v>

1900
01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:55.470
Not only did you come here and prove yourself in terms of you're insulting

1901
01:46:55.471 --> 01:47:00.000
ability to now I have to see are you really?
Can you really write songs right?

1902
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:03.570
Is it really is it,
it's all you can do battle because if that's all you can do,

1903
01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:04.820
then step to the left motherfucker.

1904
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:08.880
So someone that really has an opportunity to shine and and worked on music can

1905
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:12.300
be in this position and show that to the crowd dudes that only have like a

1906
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:15.420
battle rap game.
They don't have like a rap game.
I mean I threw,

1907
01:47:15.421 --> 01:47:18.030
I threw a personal battle,
which uh,
there were two winters,

1908
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:20.490
there was a guy a called Nestle in a class.

1909
01:47:20.491 --> 01:47:24.540
Big shout out to them and what their battle was was for the opportunity and

1910
01:47:24.541 --> 01:47:29.541
they're going to have it now to open up for a short tour that I'm going to do

1911
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:33.540
like a spot day tour for the middle passage.
So in that respect,
yeah,

1912
01:47:33.541 --> 01:47:35.100
they have to win a battle against one another.

1913
01:47:35.101 --> 01:47:39.210
And then the prize is I have to now prove myself in front of this audience.

1914
01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:42.690
I have to show them my work and I have to show them that I'm more than just a

1915
01:47:42.691 --> 01:47:45.820
battle rapper.
That's the biggest battle for me for any battle rapper.

1916
01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.710
When does that actually become a real writing to prove,
you know what,

1917
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:54.270
I'm more than just a funny guy who can come up with insults similar to the way

1918
01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:57.910
comedians struggle to get a show or they struggling to get the actual

1919
01:47:57.911 --> 01:48:01.060
correlation as Comedians at work,
the crowd,
right?
Comedians at work,

1920
01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:03.830
<v 1>the crowd versus communities and tell jokes cause you could,</v>

1921
01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:07.810
there's some guys that is as a art to making spontaneous humor up and then where

1922
01:48:07.811 --> 01:48:10.030
are you from sir?
And you know,
fucking around with people in the crowd.

1923
01:48:10.031 --> 01:48:10.900
There's an art to that.

1924
01:48:11.230 --> 01:48:15.400
But there's a lot of dudes that get good at that and they can never turned it

1925
01:48:15.401 --> 01:48:19.360
into a bit.
They can never just go up there and without interacting with people.

1926
01:48:19.361 --> 01:48:22.750
Say,
this is my thoughts on things and have it be funny.
They just can't do it.

1927
01:48:23.290 --> 01:48:27.070
They don't develop that skill.
They just steel material from,
no,
that's another,

1928
01:48:27.071 --> 01:48:29.560
that's another thing.
But there's a,
we know,
we know,
dude,

1929
01:48:29.561 --> 01:48:33.630
that's a funny guy and he doesn't,
uh,
it doesn't do any real comedy.

1930
01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:36.520
Just talks to people just,
I mean,
if he can't talk,

1931
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.700
but the crazy thing is you can't do that if you're doing 2000 people and you're

1932
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.680
10 feet in the air and they're way down at the bottom.

1933
01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:42.640
You've got to have some bits

1934
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.560
<v 2>and that's exactly,</v>

1935
01:48:43.561 --> 01:48:47.820
I think that analogy is pretty on spot because if you're not battling somebody,

1936
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:52.020
there's nobody in front of you.
You gotta be able to make it out on your own.

1937
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:53.040
It's like,
what if you don't?

1938
01:48:53.230 --> 01:48:56.420
What if you're that comedian that doesn't have that one person in the crowd that

1939
01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:00.030
came with a stupid hat and you're not.
You can't make fun of nobody no more.

1940
01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:03.210
Now you have to come up with something original and idea.

1941
01:49:03.211 --> 01:49:06.090
That's all your own that you own,
that Jen you put down,

1942
01:49:06.091 --> 01:49:08.220
which is technically what you're doing when you make soul.
Well,

1943
01:49:08.221 --> 01:49:09.380
a lot of them actually.
Yeah,
do

1944
01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.050
<v 1>what they do is they fake that they're talking to the crowd.</v>

1945
01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.260
They are talking to the crowd,
but they have like,
you know,

1946
01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:18.530
this guy says is a fireman.
I got some Goto shit for that.
You know,

1947
01:49:18.531 --> 01:49:21.770
if you guys are,
you're from Chicago,
I know what to say there.
You know,

1948
01:49:21.771 --> 01:49:24.350
there's like,
they have like a bunch of shit that they can go to.

1949
01:49:24.351 --> 01:49:27.290
They're just like plugging it into the audience and because it seems so

1950
01:49:27.291 --> 01:49:29.210
spontaneous,
it actually seems funnier.

1951
01:49:29.211 --> 01:49:32.240
It seems like it's like a little trick and it's good to fuck around with the

1952
01:49:32.241 --> 01:49:33.440
crowd sometimes.
I don't,

1953
01:49:33.441 --> 01:49:35.540
I actually don't mind a little bit of it every now and then,

1954
01:49:35.541 --> 01:49:40.250
but there's a big difference between the kind of work that's involved in just

1955
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:44.060
add living on the fly and actually writing some shit and making it a bit.

1956
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:48.160
Some people can't do both.
They can't that,
that transition.

1957
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.450
<v 0>So that's like,
I guess like a battle rapper who can't be a real rapper.
Right.</v>

1958
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:56.620
To me,
um,
me and my brother,
a poisoned pen.
We,
uh,
I'm,

1959
01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.970
I'm helping him right now in terms of,
um,
with some sponsorships and whatnot.

1960
01:50:00.971 --> 01:50:04.780
But mostly it's just been him that's been resurrecting a lot of these scenes and

1961
01:50:04.781 --> 01:50:06.910
he's very humble dude.
My brother poisoned pen.

1962
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:10.810
He doesn't like to say that he came out and invented the idea of having paper

1963
01:50:10.811 --> 01:50:13.030
view battle rap.
He doesn't like to say that.
You know,

1964
01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.060
if somebody wants to come and battle in New York that he'll guarantee that

1965
01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:19.990
safety to make sure nobody touched them.
And until all the other goons,
yo listen,

1966
01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.420
he's,
he had a battle.
You put a thing going him,

1967
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.140
you would have to answer to me and everybody else in in a squad and they already

1968
01:50:26.141 --> 01:50:29.800
know what it is.
But I think so nobody comes over here and gets her ass kicked.

1969
01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.700
Really have to be a real fuck up.
And you know what I mean?

1970
01:50:33.701 --> 01:50:37.150
We guarantee people safety in New York because it's good for them to be and we

1971
01:50:37.151 --> 01:50:38.770
won't be able to come to New York to battle.

1972
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:41.410
Imagine if there was comedy clubs we had guaranteed.
People say,

1973
01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.120
well you got to man up guarantee their safety in order to do stand up.
Whoa.

1974
01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:46.633
There's a little bit,

1975
01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:50.030
there's a little more of a street element I think involved in,

1976
01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.970
in battle rap because you have
a little tiny,

1977
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.180
just a tiny bit more.
So what I think,
uh,

1978
01:50:58.510 --> 01:51:02.200
I think you'll find that there's a diverse amount of people that are battling

1979
01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:06.750
like a diverse group of people now that are battling as opposed to it just being

1980
01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.030
two people talking about guns from the same neighborhood you have all into,

1981
01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:13.750
you have Asian,
Latino,
Jewish.
Why?

1982
01:51:14.610 --> 01:51:17.950
Swiping goes on.
We'll do it.
Swipe dudes wraps.

1983
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:24.640
How much biten material.
Lotta Shit.
Huh?
There's some binders out.

1984
01:51:24.650 --> 01:51:29.020
Their bite is out.
There's some mother fucking listen to me.

1985
01:51:29.021 --> 01:51:29.831
Y'All live.

1986
01:51:29.831 --> 01:51:33.630
We're live right here on the Joe Rogan experience with a mortal technique.
Dez,

1987
01:51:33.631 --> 01:51:34.900
some biters out there.

1988
01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.740
There's some people who can't find a style of their own or they don't have

1989
01:51:38.741 --> 01:51:42.090
anything going for them.
Know what those people think I can do with themselves.

1990
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:45.040
Leech off this snickering and they're fucking themselves.
Really?

1991
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:48.040
Because you don't know how good it feels to write some shit.
You know,

1992
01:51:48.041 --> 01:51:50.330
when I write some shit and performing like woo,

1993
01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.200
there's just came to me from the university universe told me and I'm doing the

1994
01:51:53.201 --> 01:51:55.960
right thing.
So it gave me some inspiration that gave me an idea.

1995
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:59.650
I put in the work and I got a result and it's just feels tremendous.

1996
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:03.100
They don't get that.
They don't get that feeling.
So it's like this hollow,

1997
01:52:03.101 --> 01:52:06.010
empty whore,
like whole feeling,
you know,

1998
01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:09.630
fill the hole then and fill the hole that under.

1999
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:12.520
They're not really creating anything.
It's fairly fascinating.

2000
01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:16.420
It's kind of a fascinating way to live life.
It's gotta be a weird hollow,

2001
01:52:16.421 --> 01:52:18.610
empty feeling.
But you know,
in the same,

2002
01:52:18.611 --> 01:52:22.300
in the same respect when comedy has ghost writers for example,
is different.

2003
01:52:22.301 --> 01:52:26.170
That's a job.
You know,
when a guy put together,
I know some great comments,

2004
01:52:26.230 --> 01:52:26.860
but there aren't,

2005
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:29.920
but they're all people in battle rap and they're all people in rat period.

2006
01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.380
We have plenty of ghost writers as well.
And I'm wondering,

2007
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:34.720
I don't think that thing wrong.
Does that take away from,

2008
01:52:34.810 --> 01:52:37.030
but that's the interesting thing to you.

2009
01:52:37.031 --> 01:52:41.470
It doesn't because in the culture of comedy where you have somebody like a Paul

2010
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:45.220
Mooney who wrote for Richard Pryor where you have somebody like a,

2011
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:50.300
maybe a Jeff Ross who now write vote for this person or that that's seen as as,

2012
01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.440
okay,
that's acceptable.
That's great that these,
the grades like Chris Rock,

2013
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:59.300
Chris Rock used,
uh,
the Nick Depaulo,
Jeff,
rob,
rich vos rather,

2014
01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.040
he used,
well,
they're funny comics.

2015
01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:05.210
They're great comics and bounce ideas and those ideas often helps ideas.

2016
01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.690
I think in hip hop domains,
it's,

2017
01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:10.490
I think that's looked down upon a lot more than it is anywhere else.

2018
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.580
It's like it's the kind of elephant in the room that people don't accept.
Well,

2019
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:17.780
there's a lot of people in comedy that don't accept it either.

2020
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:22.190
Like guys like Louis C K writes his own shit every year,
every year.

2021
01:53:22.191 --> 01:53:25.810
He writes his own new hour every year and he's one of the rare guys that does it

2022
01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:29.150
now.
He does it,
he does it while he's actually doing a television show to that.

2023
01:53:29.151 --> 01:53:32.540
He also edits and produces,
he's a maniac.
I don't know how the fuck does that.

2024
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:36.050
It's really incredible.
He's a based on a mouthful pill.
That is what do we know?

2025
01:53:36.051 --> 01:53:39.620
He's basically obsessed with doing great shit and the results have been so

2026
01:53:39.621 --> 01:53:44.510
spectacular.
He's just continuing on that,
that obsessive path.
It's amazing.

2027
01:53:44.511 --> 01:53:47.750
He's just shouting out,
shout out to Louis because that's what I do.

2028
01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:50.750
I write all my own rhymes.
Nobody come up in and it says,
Hey,

2029
01:53:50.751 --> 01:53:54.230
you should rap rap to this beat or you should write about that.

2030
01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:56.650
It has to be those that I do that I don't,

2031
01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.970
I don't never really accept ideas from people,

2032
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.810
but that's because I have my own shit.
I'm trying to work out already.

2033
01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.800
It's not that their ideas aren't great,

2034
01:54:04.090 --> 01:54:07.880
but just at a certain point in time I like to have it all come from my head and

2035
01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:11.210
there's a difference in between taking something that's kind of half done and

2036
01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:14.630
bouncing it off.
People you respect and being like,
you know what?

2037
01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.010
This is half done,
right.
The rest of it for me,
I'm,

2038
01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:19.610
I'll be bad comics give each other taglines to like,

2039
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:21.470
that's one thing that's really cool that I really liked doing.

2040
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:23.870
I like doing that for so like someone comes off stage and you're like,

2041
01:54:23.871 --> 01:54:27.500
what if you said this at the end?
I'm like,
Oh shit,
it's fun.

2042
01:54:27.501 --> 01:54:28.550
And then when you do it,

2043
01:54:28.551 --> 01:54:31.340
it's cool because like if somebody gives you a tag line and then you do it,

2044
01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:34.280
it's like,
it's like a shout out to your friend every time you're on stage.

2045
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:37.010
It's kind of cool,
you know,
I don't even remember the bit,

2046
01:54:37.011 --> 01:54:39.590
but somebody gave me a great tag line once and I wouldn't always think about

2047
01:54:39.591 --> 01:54:42.350
them every time I would say I don't like it was my friend,
you know,
hooked,

2048
01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.330
hooked my bid up with a little extra punch.

2049
01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:47.930
Little extra thing that that's a thing that comics will do for each other.

2050
01:54:47.931 --> 01:54:51.020
The rappers write raps for each other.
Yeah,
all the time.

2051
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:53.960
Like if someone like here's you doing a rap and then says,
oh,

2052
01:54:53.961 --> 01:54:57.840
did you know that that rhymes with booty?
No,
no I don't.

2053
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.220
I think it's more like,
you know,
for example,

2054
01:55:01.221 --> 01:55:05.480
if you're signed to a major and you wrote a song and they like it,

2055
01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:08.600
they can take your songs since they own your intellectual property and you're

2056
01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:11.630
assigned to them and they can give it to someone else being like,
Oh yeah,

2057
01:55:11.631 --> 01:55:16.490
you wrote this song for you for like Jay are whatever and we're going to give it

2058
01:55:16.491 --> 01:55:19.910
to this wrapper.
It's funny,
they used to be valid.

2059
01:55:19.911 --> 01:55:21.620
That was like a real business.

2060
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:23.950
It's like when you look at what a record label is now,

2061
01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:26.630
when you talk about something that's been diminished,

2062
01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:31.460
it's them in the porn industry have been like the most diminished because of the

2063
01:55:31.461 --> 01:55:34.370
Internet.
Fuck yeah.
All of a sudden it was,

2064
01:55:34.371 --> 01:55:36.820
you have a digital versions of everything you do and it's,

2065
01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:41.840
you don't need to go to a CD store where he might brush elbows with somebody in

2066
01:55:42.111 --> 01:55:43.720
a trench coat.
Uh,

2067
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:48.420
<v 2>uh,
some common baby come number seven,
like,
you know what I mean?</v>

2068
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:52.860
Like crazy.
So boot,
cocky,
flick in like a sick person.

2069
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:55.740
And also I think those places where embarrassing cause you,

2070
01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.080
you knew who was watching what kind of shit but what kind of aisle they were in.

2071
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:01.590
If you were walk by you were like,

2072
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:05.460
oh you're elected chairman urine,

2073
01:56:05.461 --> 01:56:09.180
the German shit crazy section.

2074
01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.500
Get the fuck Outta here.

2075
01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:13.090
<v 1>Yeah,
you don't want to hang out with that guy anymore.</v>

2076
01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:15.910
Even if it's like its own private thing.
It's like you're in the shit.

2077
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:19.470
<v 2>I,
I've never went to that kind of place.
Would anybody stop</v>

2078
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:19.921
<v 1>business?</v>

2079
01:56:19.921 --> 01:56:23.430
Got To destroy that business in the music business it used to be like the only

2080
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:25.830
way to get famous was you had to get on the radio.

2081
01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:30.330
But now the internet is really completely bypass that cause a radio.

2082
01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:34.350
You know the radio only works when you listen to the radio.
The union.

2083
01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:38.090
That is a part of everything everyday.
It's getting so weird,
man.
My,

2084
01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:42.210
my Twitter is so strange to me because I'm finding that I'm more shit through my

2085
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:42.810
Twitter,

2086
01:56:42.810 --> 01:56:46.860
through people sending me things about the latest discoveries about Egyptian

2087
01:56:46.890 --> 01:56:48.620
boats that they found from,
you know,

2088
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:51.660
all the things they found Atlantis and know there's a new discovery,

2089
01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:54.270
gorillas have figured out how to,
you know,

2090
01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.770
stop traps and disarm traps.
We find this shit.

2091
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:02.970
It's like a constant barrage of insane shit and information you're getting from

2092
01:57:02.971 --> 01:57:07.950
people all day long.
Like this is,
this is so new to humanity.

2093
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:12.270
Like we're not even sure the effects this is going to have on human beings just

2094
01:57:12.271 --> 01:57:13.550
in the next 10 or 20 years.

2095
01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.430
Like what people are going to be like with this incredible access to
information.

2096
01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.220
I mean,
I battering us with the reality.

2097
01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.760
<v 2>I put her on the Latin and Sauna.
We opened up the show with,</v>

2098
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:24.550
you know what I mean?
I speak to those,
you know what I mean?

2099
01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:29.380
That that had become socially autistic.
Is that where society's heading now?

2100
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.690
There are people,
I don't need to interact with you if I don't want to.

2101
01:57:31.691 --> 01:57:34.660
I'm here because that's the type of dude I am.
I'll come to the show,

2102
01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.520
but everyone seems to be able to want to call into life.
You know what I mean?

2103
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:42.880
You meet more people on the Internet that you're going to meet in real life.

2104
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:44.330
You know what I mean?
You meet course.
Yeah.

2105
01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:47.580
<v 1>You would never have the opportunity to meet hundreds of new people instantly.</v>

2106
01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:52.030
<v 2>Right.
And then you or or you have access to information or you know,</v>

2107
01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:54.880
you don't send letters no more.
You send an email,
you know what I mean?

2108
01:57:54.881 --> 01:57:57.850
You don't call nobody no more.
You Skype with them.
You know what I mean?

2109
01:57:57.851 --> 01:57:59.890
In some ways there's benefits to that.

2110
01:57:59.891 --> 01:58:02.530
It creates the ability to communicate with people.

2111
01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:04.090
But what kind of communication?

2112
01:58:04.091 --> 01:58:09.091
Because I've known individuals to severely misconstrue a text or an email before

2113
01:58:09.131 --> 01:58:11.740
that they can't get from a personal,
like I look at you,

2114
01:58:11.890 --> 01:58:16.630
there's something about the way you stand that tells me what your intentions
are,

2115
01:58:16.631 --> 01:58:19.420
the way you move in.
I think even in race relations,
this,

2116
01:58:19.421 --> 01:58:23.260
this works because if people who have been exposed to different races and

2117
01:58:23.261 --> 01:58:26.020
different cultures of people,
they look and see,
okay,

2118
01:58:26.021 --> 01:58:29.230
someone's rolling up on walking down the street.
You know,

2119
01:58:29.231 --> 01:58:33.550
he's not a criminal type.
He looks like this motherfuckers lost.
I would be like,

2120
01:58:33.551 --> 01:58:36.940
Yo man,
you know the,
the highways around the corner as opposed to being like,
oh,

2121
01:58:36.941 --> 01:58:39.850
because they're from here,
they're probably planning this or that.

2122
01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.190
Rather than looking their actual actions

2123
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:45.880
<v 0>of stance,
like in terms of,
of of a regular conversation,</v>

2124
01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:50.410
your tone of voice,
you know what I mean?
The way you look at Africa,
again,

2125
01:58:50.411 --> 01:58:53.440
you know,
people have to treat everybody else's.
If it was you live another life,

2126
01:58:53.441 --> 01:58:56.150
then you wouldn't have to worry.
He'd realize this guy's cool.
It's cons,

2127
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:00.160
it's concept.
The problem got dammit.
I said that it needs to be our new motto.

2128
01:59:00.161 --> 01:59:03.850
We're America and we're not cunts and everything we do.
That's conti.

2129
01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:07.690
Go stop doing it.
That's conti shit man.
I mean,

2130
01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:10.900
unless people are making billions of dollars off,
you got to stop.
You know,

2131
01:59:12.010 --> 01:59:15.040
they won't stop wanting to lose $1 billion a year and you don't have to be a

2132
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:15.730
cunt.

2133
01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:19.120
Wouldn't you be happier and you're happy to do in your business making half as

2134
01:59:19.121 --> 01:59:23.770
much having a 1000 foot yacht instead of a 2000 foot yacht.

2135
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:29.080
That's victimizing the world where American capitalism has the spotlight on it.

2136
01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.320
Because let's say you and me,
I have a company that averages,
you know,

2137
01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:36.430
around $12 billion a year of growth,
revenue sales.

2138
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.820
We're a success.
But then the next year,
you know,

2139
01:59:39.821 --> 01:59:42.920
and every year we keep getting a little bit bigger.
You know,
12 billion.

2140
01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:46.960
You get into math and you spent all your money on hooker.
[inaudible] no,
no,
no,

2141
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:51.880
no.
I'm just saying one year,
imagine we make 11 billion,
you know,
not even,

2142
01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:55.870
not even gross.
We're talking about net right now and make an 11 billion.

2143
01:59:55.871 --> 01:59:57.940
What are we doing?
Are we selling anything?
It doesn't matter.

2144
01:59:58.990 --> 02:00:02.520
The point being just want to know what kind of businesses are successful.

2145
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:04.400
The point being,
Joe,
is to,

2146
02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.210
to a lot of people in the business community and to the model of business,

2147
02:00:07.450 --> 02:00:09.550
we're a failure.
Now we're downsizing.

2148
02:00:09.551 --> 02:00:14.140
We're not going up from 12.5 billion to 13.
Now we're back to 11.

2149
02:00:14.141 --> 02:00:18.730
People like that.
Oh,
this business is on the decline.
We just made $11 billion.

2150
02:00:18.731 --> 02:00:22.240
That's just how they think.
You know what I mean?
If you're not always expanding,

2151
02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:25.360
if you're not buying new people,
if you're not buying new resources,

2152
02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:28.350
if you haven't obtained a good,
uh,

2153
02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:33.070
rapport with a government that makes,
you know,
labor laws and very,

2154
02:00:33.071 --> 02:00:36.040
very simple for you to deal with,
then you're a failure.

2155
02:00:36.041 --> 02:00:37.690
And I think that's what needs to change too,

2156
02:00:37.770 --> 02:00:41.590
in order for people to see themselves and other individuals.
Yeah,

2157
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:45.940
there's gonna be some Karma free ways to do things.
You know?

2158
02:00:45.941 --> 02:00:49.300
And I've always said like,
we need to figure out a car,
my free iPhone,

2159
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:53.230
we find out what's really involved in getting the minerals to make iPhone.

2160
02:00:53.231 --> 02:00:54.550
So like,
well,
this is fucked up too.

2161
02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.510
May very well be some children in the Congo who are scraping the mountains for

2162
02:00:58.511 --> 02:01:02.050
minerals that goes into your iPhone.
Like there's gotta be a way around that.

2163
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.110
Is there a way around that and wouldn't what we would,

2164
02:01:04.210 --> 02:01:07.690
how much would you be willing to pay for an iPhone that's not manufactured and a

2165
02:01:07.691 --> 02:01:10.540
Chinese suicide factory?
You know how to help.
I mean these,

2166
02:01:10.541 --> 02:01:13.930
these places where they have nets set up in between buildings,

2167
02:01:14.050 --> 02:01:16.390
cause so many fucking employees have committed suicide.

2168
02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:18.130
They have actually done this and people say,

2169
02:01:18.131 --> 02:01:20.800
well actually the amount of people that commit suicide in these places,

2170
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:23.620
it's very similar to the amount of people that commit suicide and real life.

2171
02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:27.280
Well,
you know what?
The differences,
that's not real life.
That's their job.

2172
02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:30.980
How many fucking people commit suicide at work?
You know,
I,

2173
02:01:30.981 --> 02:01:32.650
you don't want to talk about despair.

2174
02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:35.650
They're living in crazy dormitories and they're dropping off the roof into

2175
02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:39.980
concrete to end it.
Well,
I mean,
they're in a dorm.
That's basically,
I

2176
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.160
<v 2>mean we're talking about today.
Anything that would be anything.</v>

2177
02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:46.850
Okay with that as Chris Somebody,
I'm not criticizing China,

2178
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.680
the whole China,
but I'm saying,
look,
if you don't like prison here,

2179
02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.110
you don't like the legal system here.

2180
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:57.350
You're really not going to like it in China.
You know what I mean?

2181
02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:00.680
We're talking about a government that is very authoritarian.

2182
02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.670
Something that the u s I think really kinda envies the ability for them to just

2183
02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:07.550
tell people to shut the fuck up about things like,
listen dude,

2184
02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:11.090
we're doing all of their Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
Oh,
you're gonna see you're gonna complain.

2185
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:14.480
Shut up now the button's been pressed and everyone shuts up.

2186
02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:17.960
You know what I mean?
Olympics or,
Hey,
I take dog off the menu everywhere.
Every,

2187
02:02:17.961 --> 02:02:21.140
I don't want to see it because these people from Europe and America and as best

2188
02:02:21.141 --> 02:02:23.540
friend,
you know what I mean?
You,
you,
you might shoot a Nigga,

2189
02:02:23.541 --> 02:02:25.460
you won't go to jail.
You fuck with a dog?
Yeah.

2190
02:02:25.461 --> 02:02:27.680
That's the white man's best friend and you're going to jail,
dude.
You know,

2191
02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:28.970
that's what I did.
They made them Niggas.

2192
02:02:28.971 --> 02:02:32.330
They found all these different species of dogs and in Germany and in all these

2193
02:02:32.331 --> 02:02:33.590
other places during the Middle Ages,

2194
02:02:33.710 --> 02:02:37.640
they bred them to be what they are today Chinese people adopt funding and then

2195
02:02:37.641 --> 02:02:41.420
someone decided that they tasted really good.
I bet they do.
I don't know.

2196
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:45.280
I've had rabbit.
I've never had rabbits.
Delicious.
I've never had dogs.

2197
02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.900
Don't tell Eddie Bravo though cause go crazy.
Eddie Bravo loves ramen.

2198
02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:54.710
It's all good.
Picks their animals.
Me,
I'm a dog man,

2199
02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:57.610
but I'm just saying like to me it,
if,

2200
02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:02.640
if we're at a point where society is just unwilling to move,

2201
02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:06.920
then what's the only thing that can rectify that?
A cataclysm.

2202
02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:08.530
You think the only thing define

2203
02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:11.160
<v 1>it as information.
We got two people have to change.</v>

2204
02:03:11.161 --> 02:03:12.750
You have to change who the fuck you are.

2205
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:15.480
If you are a person that's part of the problem and you're aware that you're part

2206
02:03:15.481 --> 02:03:17.340
of the problem,
you've got to find a path away from that.

2207
02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:19.410
But if the real problem is you get addicted to life,

2208
02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:22.350
you get caught up in a system where you have a mortgage and you have car

2209
02:03:22.351 --> 02:03:25.200
payments and you have credit card bills and you have the,
you know,

2210
02:03:25.230 --> 02:03:27.360
this is worked ass,
this is for food,
this is for,

2211
02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:30.000
and you have these numbers at you have to achieve on a regular basis.

2212
02:03:30.001 --> 02:03:34.830
So there's almost no way you can detach yourself from the system and then start

2213
02:03:34.831 --> 02:03:38.370
off with some in some new path.
It's like you need constant income.

2214
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:41.190
Have you have a family and need constant income.
If you have a mortgage,

2215
02:03:41.191 --> 02:03:45.210
you need constant income,
you know,
and that's how most of us are stuck.

2216
02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:48.360
Most of us are stuck cause we sort of got on some sort of a path and then we

2217
02:03:48.361 --> 02:03:52.620
became involved in the system due to financial necessity.

2218
02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:54.800
It's like no,
I mean you're not going to go home less.

2219
02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:57.690
You're not going to have your fucking kids be poor just because you have a dream

2220
02:03:57.691 --> 02:03:59.430
of trying to make it as an author.

2221
02:03:59.550 --> 02:04:02.340
You know you're going to have to find a way to do both of them at the same time.

2222
02:04:02.341 --> 02:04:03.840
You're going to have to find a way to work around it.

2223
02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:06.660
You can't just detach yourself from the system.

2224
02:04:06.930 --> 02:04:10.110
That's why so many people have a hard time changing.
Yeah.

2225
02:04:10.111 --> 02:04:12.960
That's why so many people have a hard time changing as they don't have the time

2226
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:17.850
for reflection and when people are caught up in any sort of fanatical pursuit,

2227
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.110
especially financial fanatical pursuit,
it becomes about ones and Zeros.

2228
02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:26.010
It becomes about numbers.
It becomes about adding Zeros to the ledger.

2229
02:04:26.011 --> 02:04:30.420
It doesn't become about your own personal growth and you as a human being trying

2230
02:04:30.421 --> 02:04:34.170
to find yourself in a better place in this world.
It doesn't become about that.

2231
02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:35.370
That's the real issue.

2232
02:04:35.371 --> 02:04:39.600
The real issue is the numbers trick you into thinking that they're real instead

2233
02:04:39.601 --> 02:04:42.090
of thinking that because they are real,
you can get things from him.

2234
02:04:42.091 --> 02:04:44.240
Real things like a house that you can knock on.

2235
02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:46.770
You could get a car that you get and you knock on that car.
That's a real car.

2236
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:50.480
So there is something real that you get from it.
But essentially you're,
you're,

2237
02:04:51.190 --> 02:04:55.800
we've decided that those things are,
that you can get those things from money.

2238
02:04:56.010 --> 02:05:00.150
We've decided that we've all,
we've all decided that.
And because of that,

2239
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:04.980
because it's broken down to a number thing,
then that becomes the grand pursuit.

2240
02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:10.160
The grander soon becomes this crazy idea that you need to stock pile numbers at

2241
02:05:10.351 --> 02:05:14.910
the expense of humanity and that humanity shouldn't be put at the very forefront

2242
02:05:14.911 --> 02:05:18.240
of any of the decisions.
So all of this could've been avoided.

2243
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:23.310
Everything could have been avoided if any company realized that humanity has to

2244
02:05:23.311 --> 02:05:26.280
be first.
So if you're poisoning rivers,
if you're,
you know,

2245
02:05:26.281 --> 02:05:29.430
fucking people at Olin,
you cannot operate like that.

2246
02:05:29.431 --> 02:05:33.060
There must be a humane way to progress and do business.

2247
02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:35.040
If it only involves littering,

2248
02:05:35.070 --> 02:05:37.770
it only involves polluting and it only involves murder.

2249
02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:42.300
Well then that's ridiculous that this,
this shouldn't be a task that's,

2250
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:44.010
that's taken forth by people.

2251
02:05:44.190 --> 02:05:47.910
But because of the fact that you can get ones and zeroes from those things,

2252
02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:52.230
the ones and Zeros of tricked us into thinking that that they are the end all be

2253
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:56.100
all by providing us with real things that come from the ones and Zeros.

2254
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:58.740
They have sort of figured out a way to hijack our system,

2255
02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:03.270
but we have to realize that solid things don't mean shit if you don't have your

2256
02:06:03.271 --> 02:06:08.010
humanity.
So it's not about ones and Zeros,
it's about humanity first.

2257
02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:12.870
Then it's about should humanity engage in this pursuit?
Should humanity,

2258
02:06:13.110 --> 02:06:13.561
you know,

2259
02:06:13.561 --> 02:06:18.561
a drill oil off the coast when it can fuck up like that and ruined square miles.

2260
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:22.940
It was,
there would be nothing wrong with it.

2261
02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:28.040
This was a perfectly right and then we find out that it was all about ones and

2262
02:06:28.041 --> 02:06:28.611
Zeros.

2263
02:06:28.611 --> 02:06:31.370
The reason why it happened in the first place is because the company that was

2264
02:06:31.371 --> 02:06:32.210
building the,
well,

2265
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:35.390
they cut a few corners because they were trying to make a deadline and they put

2266
02:06:35.391 --> 02:06:39.680
a less effective sort of a system in place and then it fucking exploded and

2267
02:06:39.681 --> 02:06:43.520
killed people and fucked up everything.
For a long ass time.
Why?

2268
02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:46.760
Because of ones and zero's not because of humanity.
You know,

2269
02:06:46.761 --> 02:06:48.410
it's the same thing with Fukushima.
You know,

2270
02:06:48.411 --> 02:06:52.400
people look at this reactor failing and melting down and there's all sorts of

2271
02:06:52.401 --> 02:06:55.880
scientific,
you know,
uh,
explanations for why it all went wrong.

2272
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:58.610
But the bottom line is you shouldn't make something like that.

2273
02:06:58.850 --> 02:07:00.590
If you can't shut it off,
you couldn't.

2274
02:07:00.591 --> 02:07:03.350
You shouldn't make something where if the power goes out,

2275
02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:08.210
the whole place is fucked for a hundred thousand years.
That's crazy.

2276
02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:12.710
That's crazy.
And that's a ones and Zeros economic situation.

2277
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:16.250
I think when you told him about an element though,
that has been refined,

2278
02:07:16.251 --> 02:07:18.170
we told them about you too much nuclear power.

2279
02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:21.050
We're talking about when you're talking about uranium,

2280
02:07:21.051 --> 02:07:22.280
you're talking about plutonium,

2281
02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:27.080
all of these elements that are created by me and kind of these isotopes,

2282
02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:28.940
they're generally unstable.

2283
02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:31.610
He might have the same number of protons and electrons,

2284
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:34.520
but it's the neutrons that flow out of them.
Well,

2285
02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:37.180
I always thought was interesting is how did the neutrons,
no,

2286
02:07:37.181 --> 02:07:39.880
just to leave that there just too many that we all just don't fit.

2287
02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:42.250
Or did they take anybody's bullshit?

2288
02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:46.750
Neutrons just bounced the focus and it creates an unstable element.

2289
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:50.110
That's even toying with that.
Even toying with something like that,

2290
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:53.560
you don't know because it doesn't have a stable physical property.

2291
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:58.690
There is no shut off.
Well that's what Zoe,
to cool it off apparently.
Yeah,

2292
02:07:58.691 --> 02:08:02.530
they had to,
they had to use a or whatever these water,

2293
02:08:02.531 --> 02:08:05.980
ocean water and not really caught on and they don't know what the fuck is going

2294
02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:06.401
to happen.

2295
02:08:06.401 --> 02:08:11.170
I mean the whole thing is insane and it all happened because someone thought

2296
02:08:11.171 --> 02:08:13.720
that they could profit from it.
They needed power,

2297
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:17.020
they needed to supply all these people with power and that became the way to do

2298
02:08:17.021 --> 02:08:21.910
it.
It's just seems so nutty.
It seems so incredibly nutty and it's,

2299
02:08:21.911 --> 02:08:23.830
but it's either that or we're going to do,
are you going to Cole,
you know,

2300
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:27.670
fucking,
you know,
have coal factories and fuck up the environment even more.

2301
02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:30.370
And then which one are you going to go with?
We need some electricity bitch.

2302
02:08:30.710 --> 02:08:34.120
Right?
Someone needs to figure out a better way than that.
Solar energy.

2303
02:08:34.150 --> 02:08:38.650
But we get tripped up g and he's one ways we get tripped up and get caught up in

2304
02:08:38.651 --> 02:08:41.590
this one way and we think that's the only way possible.
You know,

2305
02:08:41.591 --> 02:08:44.800
I don't know what the fuck the Egyptians did,
but they did something,

2306
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:48.460
they did something that allowed him to move these giant blocks of stone.

2307
02:08:48.461 --> 02:08:51.440
Like what the fuck were they doing?
Our dance slave?

2308
02:08:51.441 --> 02:08:53.980
Thousands of people and until then I'm going to move that stone.
Yeah,

2309
02:08:53.981 --> 02:08:56.950
but it doesn't matter.
Even if they did that,
how the fuck they pull it off.

2310
02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.490
Even if they had thousands they had,
but they had engineering.

2311
02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:00.910
I think at that particular time.

2312
02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:05.050
What we fail to see and we fail to realize is that,
look,

2313
02:09:05.051 --> 02:09:08.800
all of the documentation that they had was lost in countless amount of wars.

2314
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:11.920
It's been still libraries of Alexandria was actually Bryan.

2315
02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:16.090
They're burnt down twice.
We'd lost all that information,
but it still doesn't,

2316
02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:19.090
it still doesn't any in any way to answer the question,

2317
02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.470
how about fuck did they do that?

2318
02:09:20.710 --> 02:09:24.130
Because what you're looking at it as something that we can do right now.

2319
02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:27.280
I mean there's a lot of those pieces that we can go right now.

2320
02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:29.160
You know what I mean?
It's just cut from a Corey,

2321
02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:34.090
it was miles away and these motherfuckers moved these thousand ton stone blocks.

2322
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:37.180
Like how about the Acropolis where the Parthenon is under one of these?

2323
02:09:37.610 --> 02:09:42.280
It's under the Parthenon,
rather these huge fucking stones that no one has.

2324
02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:45.730
No one has any idea how they moved them there and no one has any idea how old

2325
02:09:45.731 --> 02:09:46.564
they are.

2326
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:50.190
They just somehow or another someone cut these giant stones and put them into

2327
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:53.950
place and you just go walk at.
But I mean when you go down to South America,

2328
02:09:53.951 --> 02:09:57.120
you go to see the Incas,
you'll see that too.
It Machu Picchu,

2329
02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:01.300
absolutely perfectly credible work.
They were cut by lasers.

2330
02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:06.100
How Boston is a pool and punk.
Cool and all that shit up in Peru.
It's,

2331
02:10:06.101 --> 02:10:06.740
it's amazing.

2332
02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:10.330
Or how does it heads on Easter island get there and all that extra curricular?

2333
02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:11.560
Sure.
Yeah.
Well not only that,

2334
02:10:11.561 --> 02:10:13.780
they found out those heads aren't just heads anymore.

2335
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:17.050
They started digging underneath him and there's whole bodies to those things.

2336
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:19.570
Whole bodies in.
It's interesting because they're not weathered,

2337
02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:22.900
so they get to see the much more intricate carvings like the sea,

2338
02:10:22.901 --> 02:10:26.200
like their hands and shit.
But the body's go like way down low.

2339
02:10:26.201 --> 02:10:30.030
There's a been a whole field of study now.
Now they're,

2340
02:10:30.031 --> 02:10:33.560
they're really kind of tripping out about how it seems very suspect that they

2341
02:10:33.561 --> 02:10:34.250
just didn't

2342
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:38.450
<v 3>look at that before like,
oh really man,
because it's so,
it's farther down.
Yeah.</v>

2343
02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.140
<v 1>Two things.
One,
it's they didn't have the technology.</v>

2344
02:10:41.141 --> 02:10:44.560
I don't think to measure the earth.
I shovel.
No,
no seismic.

2345
02:10:44.561 --> 02:10:47.500
Because if you just dig down like that,
you could fuck it up.

2346
02:10:47.770 --> 02:10:50.350
You can fuck up the site.
And when they do that,

2347
02:10:50.351 --> 02:10:53.230
you're supposed to do it like microscopically when you like,

2348
02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:57.960
like this thing that they're doing in Turkey,
this go Beckley tapping.
This is,

2349
02:10:57.961 --> 02:10:58.630
is uh,

2350
02:10:58.630 --> 02:11:03.630
one of the oldest known structures that's w it was at least 13,000 years old and

2351
02:11:04.181 --> 02:11:06.010
it was built by people who they thought were like,

2352
02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.050
at the time they will hunter and gatherers.

2353
02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:11.800
It throws a big monkey wrench into that because there's this huge stone columns

2354
02:11:11.801 --> 02:11:15.520
and it's,
you know,
nine foot tall stone columns with,
you know,

2355
02:11:15.521 --> 02:11:19.090
exotic animals carved into them.
Incredible,
incredible work.

2356
02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:24.300
And it's all from 13 plus thousand years ago and it was all filled in 13,000

2357
02:11:24.371 --> 02:11:25.090
years ago,

2358
02:11:25.090 --> 02:11:29.200
artificially filled and humanity is thousands of years old and you probably

2359
02:11:29.201 --> 02:11:30.850
think it is much more.

2360
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:35.320
So what's nutty about this one is that they've actually found that somehow or

2361
02:11:35.321 --> 02:11:39.730
another was buried and they purposely buried at 13,000 years ago.

2362
02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:41.530
My point was they've only,

2363
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:45.760
they've only been able to explore a tiny percentage of this site because when

2364
02:11:45.761 --> 02:11:49.450
they explore it,
they use like fucking toothbrushes and shit cause they're like,

2365
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:51.160
they're looking for any little thing.

2366
02:11:51.161 --> 02:11:53.560
They don't want to dig in with a shovel and break a bone.

2367
02:11:53.561 --> 02:11:56.130
That could have been a skull,
you know,
they don't want to fuck up.
So they're,

2368
02:11:56.131 --> 02:11:57.970
they're doing everything nice and slow.

2369
02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:01.210
So they've only uncovered like a very small percentage of this place.

2370
02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:05.530
So it's not suspect that the Easter island guys never dug into that because if

2371
02:12:05.531 --> 02:12:06.000
they did,

2372
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.130
<v 3>they do really precise.
I mean like,
like I said,</v>

2373
02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:12.990
I mean it's not saying it's just seems like stone.
Yeah,
it seems like it.

2374
02:12:12.991 --> 02:12:15.660
Like if there,
here's the land right here and then they're probably like,

2375
02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:19.500
hey look,
it's,
it's still going down.
Let's go.
Like,

2376
02:12:19.501 --> 02:12:21.960
I mean these things have been in here for sorghum and Brian,

2377
02:12:21.961 --> 02:12:23.580
but you got to understand when they did find that,

2378
02:12:23.581 --> 02:12:25.250
when they initially found them,
they were so shocked.

2379
02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:26.670
They were so big in the first place.

2380
02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.760
They couldn't figure out how people made though.
It's not even the head,

2381
02:12:29.761 --> 02:12:33.360
but how did they get that stone there?
They don't know where it came from.

2382
02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:35.220
I mean it came from somewhere on the island obviously,

2383
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:39.910
but help dog getting invited.
That's one of his little homie.

2384
02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:43.810
You take some other,
there's other pictures of them.
If you find them online,

2385
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:44.663
they're pretty interesting.

2386
02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:50.220
<v 1>There's a a lot of the work that's been dedicated to that now and then trying to</v>

2387
02:12:50.441 --> 02:12:53.530
figure out how the fuck they did it and what it's supposed to represent.
Two,

2388
02:12:53.531 --> 02:12:55.960
why are they doing the same guy like that over and over and over again?

2389
02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:59.260
Who was that guy?
And of course that's where the ancient aliens come in.

2390
02:12:59.650 --> 02:13:01.660
You know those dudes,
those Giorgio sucralose,

2391
02:13:01.661 --> 02:13:03.790
Dude's we've had him on a podcast a bunch of times.
I love that.

2392
02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:06.600
<v 3>I heard Katy Perry wants to meet him.</v>

2393
02:13:06.650 --> 02:13:11.360
Like there was this thing like a report the other day.
Imagine if we,
we made it,

2394
02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:16.290
her and him hook it up and then he replaced Russell brand.
No Way.

2395
02:13:16.291 --> 02:13:20.190
If they met,
we met her and then we still heard from George.

2396
02:13:20.370 --> 02:13:23.690
Do you want to Steal Katy Perry?
Get out of here.
So yeah,
I want 20 period.

2397
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:27.180
Her Beta boyfriend that travels around tour,
that's going to do it.

2398
02:13:27.181 --> 02:13:30.210
You don't want that.
You don't want that Gig.
She'll force you to get fat again.

2399
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.070
I don't do it.
Did we talk,

2400
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:36.600
did you talk about on on a podcast about how hilarious that Tim Tim,

2401
02:13:36.601 --> 02:13:39.090
Hi decker has been a d

2402
02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:41.450
<v 0>going off on Russell.
We didn't talk about it.
Right.</v>

2403
02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:45.990
And Russell brand's an English guy who's a really funny actor.

2404
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:49.250
He's really funny and I'm getting into the Greek dude,
right?
Yeah.

2405
02:13:49.290 --> 02:13:53.790
I didn't see that movie,
but I loved Him in the Sarah Marshall Movie.
Uh,
but he's,

2406
02:13:53.791 --> 02:13:57.640
um,
apparently he's got a talk show and uh,

2407
02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:00.930
every time it's on Tim,
Hi decker destroys it.

2408
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:05.820
He just goes after it and like spend the whole hour like writing hashtag like

2409
02:14:05.821 --> 02:14:10.310
vomit,
like sarcastic shit about things not being funny.
Hashtag vomit,
you know,

2410
02:14:10.311 --> 02:14:13.590
just shitting all over in Russell brand.
Well,
his is obsessed with it.

2411
02:14:13.730 --> 02:14:16.730
<v 3>I think his new show is,
I forget what it's called.</v>

2412
02:14:16.731 --> 02:14:21.590
It's like something x or something like that.
Brand X.
Good.
Have you seen it?

2413
02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:26.000
No,
I actually not a big fan of his,

2414
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:29.510
he don't like him as an actor.
I no actor.
I do like him as an actor,

2415
02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:33.710
but this is not an actor.
This is like some weird talk show,
isn't it?

2416
02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:34.633
Or something like that.

2417
02:14:34.970 --> 02:14:39.920
But the poster is so they have it all over sunset and it's just him like laying

2418
02:14:39.921 --> 02:14:43.220
back with his feet up and like,
I don't know.
It's,

2419
02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.850
did you see what someone wrote on a,
on one of the posters?
Graffiti where they,

2420
02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:49.250
right.
I'd Rather Watch Katy Perry's new movie.

2421
02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:57.260
<v 0>There you go,
Katie.
There's some loyal fans.
What it says,</v>

2422
02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:01.360
<v 3>where is it?
Ah,
that's not the,
that gets,
this is a poster that they did it too.</v>

2423
02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:04.970
Yeah,
he's wild.
Don't you get it?
He's English and wild.
Yeah.

2424
02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:08.000
But if you look at Tim High Decker's he does Tim and Eric.
I,

2425
02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:12.630
if you look at his Twitter page,
it's just one after another.
Just hilarious.

2426
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:15.480
<v 0>He just tamarind them tearing them up.</v>

2427
02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.130
I guess a lot of a lot of people are saying is not very good.
Um,

2428
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.460
he just don't like it.
I get to mediocrity.
He likes,

2429
02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:26.220
is he Perry is a warrior against mediocrity I think.
Yeah.

2430
02:15:26.370 --> 02:15:29.310
I think he's just trying to impress Katie.
I think so.
And I don't blame them.

2431
02:15:29.311 --> 02:15:32.250
It could be that too.
Maybe he's trying to get points saying,

2432
02:15:32.251 --> 02:15:34.500
Yo look your man don't like you,
don't appreciate you.

2433
02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:37.440
I'll appreciate you watched.
Look at me,
destroy Ya.

2434
02:15:37.441 --> 02:15:41.810
Your ex to maybe it could be a little bit of that.
You think,
wow,

2435
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:47.410
why don't we ask him right now as you go and respond to us on sweater and mood

2436
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:49.860
show,
we saying you want her just hollow.

2437
02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:53.460
I think he's just a champion against mediocrity that could make you think.

2438
02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:55.500
He just really genuinely thinks that guys sucks.

2439
02:16:01.590 --> 02:16:06.540
Why did they agree to that?
Why did he agree to that photo?
Do you have friends?

2440
02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:09.030
Do you have friends?
Cause they shouldn't,

2441
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:12.280
but I think when you get enough money day,
uh,

2442
02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.810
you're just surrounded by yes men.
Yes man.
Is that really true?

2443
02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:19.050
I think there's a way to avoid that.
It's got to be some people that will say,

2444
02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:22.440
hey man,
you know,
like for example,
I have a lot of friends,

2445
02:16:22.441 --> 02:16:24.240
like what am I producer's name is Sao Paulo.

2446
02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:26.530
I've known his brother for over 30 years.
You know,
we,

2447
02:16:26.531 --> 02:16:29.920
we went to nursery school together.
If I'm on some bullshit,

2448
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.770
<v 2>he'll tell me like,
Yo man,
look dude,
get the fuck outta here.</v>

2449
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:36.370
Does he have to tell you that sometimes?
Yes.
We asked to tell me,
Yo man,

2450
02:16:36.371 --> 02:16:39.490
like when we were doing our last album,
like,
Yo man,
get the fuck up man.

2451
02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:41.590
We got to get this going.
We got to get this moving.

2452
02:16:41.591 --> 02:16:44.860
Like he's a good motivator when he's on it.
He was on some bullshit.

2453
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:48.850
I'm the one that's got a him battle.
When you're on the road battle,
I mean,

2454
02:16:49.090 --> 02:16:52.510
you see it comes on a road sometimes.
It depends on what the dynamic is.

2455
02:16:52.511 --> 02:16:54.980
Like what I need.
I have different amounts of people,
um,

2456
02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.820
that will come like people from the rebel alarms.
It's possible

2457
02:16:57.890 --> 02:17:01.340
<v 1>to not live your life with yes men,
but you gotta be,</v>

2458
02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:03.740
you gotta be your own worst critic.
You gotta be your,
I mean,

2459
02:17:03.741 --> 02:17:06.410
a lot of people don't like to do that.
They don't like that feeling of being,

2460
02:17:06.890 --> 02:17:11.100
of introspective feeling of feeling,
of really analyzing yourself objective.

2461
02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.760
A lot of people don't like that.
That's why they need someone to check them.

2462
02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:16.760
Because you have to,
you can do it yourself.
Yeah,
you can do it yourself.

2463
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:20.360
You have to look at yourself.
But it's finding that time.
See for me,

2464
02:17:20.361 --> 02:17:22.520
that's where the isolation tank comes in.
You know,

2465
02:17:22.521 --> 02:17:25.610
I use a sensory deprivation tank.
It's like a thank you lion with water.

2466
02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:30.150
When I'm in that thing you,
there's nothing.
It's quiet.
There's no,

2467
02:17:30.151 --> 02:17:32.030
so I'm not seeing anything.
I'm not feeling anything.

2468
02:17:32.031 --> 02:17:34.400
I'm just floating in that water.
And when you're doing that,

2469
02:17:34.401 --> 02:17:38.300
you're forced to think about yourself.
You're forced to analyze your behavior.

2470
02:17:38.301 --> 02:17:40.310
It's like there's nothing else there to distract you.

2471
02:17:40.311 --> 02:17:43.670
There's no TV to watch to flood your brain with useless shit.

2472
02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:46.190
There's no email check,
just no Twitter to check.

2473
02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:48.560
There's no wall to stare at and look at a painting.

2474
02:17:48.561 --> 02:17:51.200
You know you're forced to be alone with your thoughts.

2475
02:17:51.201 --> 02:17:52.730
So you're forced to analyze your life.

2476
02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:57.260
And it makes me think that there's not a lot of time in life to ever achieve

2477
02:17:57.261 --> 02:17:58.340
that sort of same state.

2478
02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:02.210
The state of self analysis does not a lot of time to do that.

2479
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:03.680
And if you're not analyzing,

2480
02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:07.130
then a lot of fucking you're doing just running around with slippery shoes on,

2481
02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:09.470
you know,
you're not getting anywhere.
You're fucking this thing,

2482
02:18:09.650 --> 02:18:12.440
you're not looking at it.
You're,
you're learning a little bit here and there,

2483
02:18:12.441 --> 02:18:16.910
but not as much as you could be if he just really spent a certain amount of

2484
02:18:16.911 --> 02:18:21.530
required time to just analyze your shit.
And this is again,

2485
02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:24.350
what people don't do.
So that,

2486
02:18:24.351 --> 02:18:29.240
and don't be a cunt or the two best piece of advices a human being could ever

2487
02:18:29.241 --> 02:18:32.630
get.
And yet those are also two pieces of advice they never give you.

2488
02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.770
That's really the simplest thing.
That's the only way we're gonna fix this world.

2489
02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:37.940
We're not going to fix this world.

2490
02:18:37.941 --> 02:18:41.870
I don't think through some new technology or through some actual genetic

2491
02:18:41.871 --> 02:18:42.411
evolution.

2492
02:18:42.411 --> 02:18:45.230
I think we're going to fix this world through or behavioral revolution.

2493
02:18:45.231 --> 02:18:46.970
And that revolution is you're going to,

2494
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:48.450
we're going to have to start looking at each other.

2495
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:50.890
<v 2>Let me ask the other way.</v>

2496
02:18:50.891 --> 02:18:55.540
The world can change and since we are in 2012 I'd be remissed from bring it up.

2497
02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:59.950
People are saying now that they'll be some kind of cataclysm at some point,

2498
02:18:59.951 --> 02:19:01.060
some cataclysmic event.

2499
02:19:01.510 --> 02:19:06.510
I think even though I don't necessarily agree that that's definitely gonna

2500
02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:07.750
Happen,

2501
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:11.140
I always say that I can subscribe to the possibility of something like that

2502
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:14.800
happened.
I've always said that,
but that's not the point.

2503
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:16.750
Not y two k or the Mayan prophecy.

2504
02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:20.200
Just the point that if something terrible did happen,

2505
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:24.490
isn't that the time when everybody seems to come together and it's not an 11 and

2506
02:19:24.491 --> 02:19:27.770
if that terrible thing was permanent and it wasn't,
we could just

2507
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.790
<v 0>pushed to the back of our memory and say,
hey,
I don't want to deal.</v>

2508
02:19:30.791 --> 02:19:33.590
I don't want to get in the isolation tank and deal with the fact that yes,

2509
02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:38.060
we did sponsor a jihad against the Russians and when someone was blowing things

2510
02:19:38.061 --> 02:19:38.301
up,

2511
02:19:38.301 --> 02:19:42.950
there's some mom in Russia right now who cried over her dead son back in the 70s

2512
02:19:42.951 --> 02:19:46.760
and eighties and her pain is no different than any American mother that's,

2513
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:49.760
you know,
suffering because their son died and I wreck at some point.

2514
02:19:49.761 --> 02:19:52.640
If we don't put ourselves in that isolation tech and say,
you know,

2515
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:53.960
we can't escape this.

2516
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:56.840
This is something permanent that has affected our are the real problems,

2517
02:19:57.170 --> 02:20:00.170
then we have to come together.
The problem is the word we,
and I was like,

2518
02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:01.250
who's actually doing this?

2519
02:20:01.251 --> 02:20:04.580
Who's actually doing very small amount of people that are actually in charge of

2520
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.160
the heinous acts of the world?
It's really kind of fucked up.

2521
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:11.750
Small amount of people put forth the motion of a large group of people that work

2522
02:20:11.751 --> 02:20:15.050
for the cause,
but it's a very small amount of cons.
It's really,

2523
02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:19.370
it's kind of incredible when you really stop and look at how fucked up the
world,

2524
02:20:19.371 --> 02:20:23.060
they slightly smaller people isolated.
Cons.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2525
02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:25.700
Like guys like guys like Dick Cheney.

2526
02:20:25.701 --> 02:20:29.600
Remember when he was in that bunker all the time deciding what Bush should do?

2527
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:30.980
What the fuck was that about?

2528
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:34.040
Dude would just hide in a bunker and we would just go up,
we're here,
Dick,

2529
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:37.100
how do I know he's in the bunker?
I mean,
that seems really stupid.

2530
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:40.100
I'm not even trying to find this out and I know that he's in the bunker.

2531
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:43.970
You know what I mean?
What the fuck kind of weird shit is that?

2532
02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:48.290
Are you so confident and that God damn bunker listen to people like him are in a

2533
02:20:48.291 --> 02:20:52.220
position that they're in because they convince other individuals that their

2534
02:20:52.221 --> 02:20:54.620
moral leaders then somewhat like,
look,

2535
02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:57.890
this is my only thing in terms of Republicans and Democrats,

2536
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.440
when we had this debate and we discuss it there,

2537
02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:05.180
they're both have to pander to corporations.
However,
my experience,

2538
02:21:05.181 --> 02:21:09.140
I've met a lot more conservative people that try to play pious and like,
oh,

2539
02:21:09.141 --> 02:21:12.770
that's so horrible and as opposed to saying,
yeah,
we're all part of this.

2540
02:21:12.771 --> 02:21:14.780
You know what I mean?
As opposed to just be who you want to be.

2541
02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:18.350
Instead you lie about who you want to be and then you're trying to pick men up

2542
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:20.090
in an airport bathroom,

2543
02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:23.450
you're secretly selling arms to enemies.

2544
02:21:23.451 --> 02:21:25.790
Are you doing it and just just be who you are,

2545
02:21:25.791 --> 02:21:28.850
but at some point you couldn't be in that position.

2546
02:21:28.851 --> 02:21:32.120
You are unless you didn't convince people that you're a good Christian.

2547
02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.810
You know what I mean?
That you're a humble person,

2548
02:21:35.811 --> 02:21:39.530
that you care about other people when in reality you're probably not any of

2549
02:21:39.531 --> 02:21:42.710
these things and you've got into politics because it's a good fucking pay day.

2550
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:47.470
Well,
it's also the power power to the reason why.
Well women and yeah,

2551
02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:50.030
the reason why anybody who wants to be president shouldn't be president.

2552
02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:52.190
He said nobody should want to be president.

2553
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:54.860
Nobody would should want to be that guy.

2554
02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.740
The one guy that gets to decide everything how are giving you,
you're crazy.

2555
02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:00.410
You're out of your fucking mind.
The position shouldn't exist anymore.

2556
02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:04.940
It shouldn't be a way where one person is thought of as our great leader in 2012

2557
02:22:04.941 --> 02:22:08.320
it's nonsense.
That is,
that is a,
it's a,

2558
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:11.540
a form of leadership,

2559
02:22:11.541 --> 02:22:16.340
a form of hierarchy that exists in small groups of primates.
Okay.

2560
02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:20.840
That Alpha Shit works with one person when there's like 50 people,

2561
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:24.950
but I don't think that gotta be the bad motherfucker is a functional system.
Now.

2562
02:22:24.951 --> 02:22:28.020
I think that's the imagery the system gives you.
But obviously I know,

2563
02:22:28.021 --> 02:22:31.140
but I'm saying like you should be a cabinet,

2564
02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:32.910
but people have not just the cabinet.

2565
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:38.060
He has a plethora of backers that have given financially to it and at the end of

2566
02:22:39.991 --> 02:22:43.260
every election he represents them.
Mother fuckers expect to get paid.

2567
02:22:43.261 --> 02:22:45.300
They expect to get what they gave.
You know what I mean?

2568
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:49.050
Like if I make a fucking investment homie,
I want some returns.

2569
02:22:49.051 --> 02:22:51.170
This is what's going to,
you're going to do something for me.
I gave,

2570
02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.160
that's why Mitch Romney,

2571
02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:55.080
Romney is so dangerous with this medical marijuana should,

2572
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:58.950
he's the most dangerous cause he says he'll fight tooth and claw to stop medical

2573
02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:02.460
marijuana.
Well of course too.
Of course you will.
Someone's paying you to do that.

2574
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:06.000
SMART,
smart,
smart for you to get on that hustle too.

2575
02:23:06.001 --> 02:23:09.930
That hustle's a weak ass hustle that's a dumber hustle.
The Republican hustles,

2576
02:23:09.931 --> 02:23:13.700
Wade dumber because a lot of it is based on,
you know,
silly ideologies.
Look,

2577
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:14.160
it's done.

2578
02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:18.900
People that don't want to think one in one of their primary selling points has

2579
02:23:18.901 --> 02:23:23.190
always been religion,
especially in the modern age.
And I would,

2580
02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:27.300
I would say more so after the Reagan era because one of the first presidents to

2581
02:23:27.301 --> 02:23:31.290
really bring out evangelical voters was actually Jimmy Carter and not any

2582
02:23:31.291 --> 02:23:32.850
republican really at first.

2583
02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:36.090
They always attributed to Reagan's administration as an actor.
We targeted them.

2584
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:38.190
Jimmy had more of them.
Again,

2585
02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:39.440
<v 2>south,</v>

2586
02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:43.580
very Christian for humanitarian armor played that up very much so man of the

2587
02:23:43.581 --> 02:23:46.220
people.
But at at some particular point,

2588
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:50.270
if we're incorporating your philosophy into and in with the corporate goals and

2589
02:23:50.271 --> 02:23:52.940
stuff,
I always thought about it this way,
you know,

2590
02:23:53.330 --> 02:23:55.490
if religion is that the selling point,

2591
02:23:56.270 --> 02:24:01.270
then let's sit in that tank where we move everything apart and we think about

2592
02:24:01.641 --> 02:24:05.480
humanity as a whole.
In Egypt 3,500 years ago,

2593
02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:09.200
people worship deities like a,
a new bid.
So Cyrus,
you know,

2594
02:24:09.201 --> 02:24:13.730
an anthropomorphic figure with the body of a human being and the head of a
jackal

2595
02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:18.490
<v 0>or a or an apple.
No,
other than that and the highest fuck son.
That's why,</v>

2596
02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:19.530
or they,

2597
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:20.363
<v 2>they just,</v>

2598
02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:23.790
they prayed to these figures thinking that they were going to bring them food
or,

2599
02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:28.020
or,
or love or long life or a cure,
right?

2600
02:24:28.470 --> 02:24:31.800
Everything that was real back then,
that's real to them now where that's fake,

2601
02:24:31.801 --> 02:24:34.410
then it's fake now.
But my thing is this,
if,

2602
02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:38.430
if we look at it from that perspective now as Americans,
like,
oh,

2603
02:24:38.431 --> 02:24:42.630
that's so ridiculous.
Somebody worshiping a statue like that with it.
Well,

2604
02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:46.290
that's 3,500 years from now.
If,

2605
02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:51.380
if humanity makes it 3,500 years from today and they look back at this time,

2606
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:56.430
I know exactly what they'll say.
They'll say,
just as we said about those people,

2607
02:24:56.610 --> 02:24:58.320
look at these ridiculous,

2608
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:02.850
pathetic human beings that lived at this time and they worshiped the dead guy

2609
02:25:02.851 --> 02:25:06.240
nailed to a piece of wood and they couldn't understand the most basic thing he

2610
02:25:06.241 --> 02:25:10.110
was trying to tell people,
which is treat others the way you want to be treated

2611
02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:14.100
<v 0>or they worship the dude who you can't even draw or people want to kill you.</v>

2612
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.680
Right?
Or at any point took that,

2613
02:25:17.010 --> 02:25:19.530
<v 2>took a position,
took a position that said,</v>

2614
02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:24.860
I'm going to think to create the ability to just tell people something and not

2615
02:25:27.101 --> 02:25:31.060
have them question it ever at all.
Yeah.
That's,

2616
02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:33.880
that's the most dangerous.
Why not think about anything?

2617
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:35.920
Because you should be able to say,
hey man,

2618
02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:39.450
if one of these things is a logical than all of them have to be.

2619
02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:43.270
If you're telling me,
Oh,
it's impossible for Jesus to have resurrected.
Okay,

2620
02:25:43.271 --> 02:25:48.130
but it's possible for man to divide the ocean for someone that the Prophet

2621
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:51.940
Muhammad peace be on him,
ascends into heaven.
That's the same thing to me.

2622
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.680
Or is the same impossibility.

2623
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:57.130
But I think that when you look at people's lives who live in poverty,

2624
02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:01.540
the reason that that's so that's so prevalent there is because their lives are

2625
02:26:01.541 --> 02:26:05.380
so ridiculous because their lives are so insane that I couldn't understand.

2626
02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:10.150
But that's just as as outlandish to me as walking on water.
The idea that,

2627
02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:10.840
you know what,

2628
02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:13.630
I'm going to have to drink my own pissed today or I'm not going to fucking be

2629
02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:17.250
hydrated,
or I have to go for three days without food or,

2630
02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:19.240
or I have to cut pieces of my flushed out.

2631
02:26:19.241 --> 02:26:22.630
So you're saying that their life was so fuck that they,
the religion,

2632
02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:25.300
it was easy to give them religion.
Well,
I put it this way.

2633
02:26:25.301 --> 02:26:28.030
I'll give you a personal example.
Rather than using a hypothetical,

2634
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:30.470
my grandmother whose house I just left,
well,

2635
02:26:30.471 --> 02:26:32.530
I just like I was telling him before I took it to Vons,

2636
02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:37.060
I always show grandma love.
I care about her a lot.
She raised 10 kids,

2637
02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:41.290
you know what I mean?
God bless her soul.
My grandfather,
God rest.
His soul was a,

2638
02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.870
was a good man in his later years,

2639
02:26:43.871 --> 02:26:47.440
but he fucked up a lot of things in his first year is so he wasn't around a lot

2640
02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:51.940
and I always think to myself like there's something about the idea that grandma

2641
02:26:51.941 --> 02:26:56.740
had that somewhere in the sky that that a guy named Jesus,

2642
02:26:56.980 --> 02:27:00.220
you know what I mean with the mullet and I'm the cut,
you know what I mean?

2643
02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:04.360
And the blue eyes was out there watching it and she depended on that idea.

2644
02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.740
I'm not trying to steal that love and compassion from anybody.

2645
02:27:08.890 --> 02:27:12.340
I'm not trying to take any religion away from people at all.

2646
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:16.270
I just tell them all the time that unless your religion makes you a better

2647
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:20.650
person,
unless it,
unless it makes you less judgmental over people's lives.

2648
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:24.610
If it makes you more generous,
if it makes you look at people and say,
Hey,

2649
02:27:24.611 --> 02:27:27.160
just like you said,
you know what?
What if I was that person?

2650
02:27:27.161 --> 02:27:29.560
What if I grew up like that?
Then it's in noble June.

2651
02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.010
But if it makes you more pretentious,
if it makes you more of an asshole,

2652
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.970
if it makes you say,

2653
02:27:33.971 --> 02:27:37.000
I just have the real truth and everyone who doesn't believe in what I believe in

2654
02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:37.834
is going to hell,

2655
02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:41.800
then your religion has failed you as much of you as you failed that religion.

2656
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:45.830
In My,
in my humble opinion,
that's all I would say that without that connection,

2657
02:27:45.831 --> 02:27:50.170
it's an ideology and the cardiologists and answers questions that have no

2658
02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:52.420
answers.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's not,

2659
02:27:52.421 --> 02:27:54.040
not that there couldn't have been a Jesus,

2660
02:27:54.041 --> 02:27:56.380
not that he couldn't have been a girl came back from the dead and how the fuck

2661
02:27:56.381 --> 02:27:59.460
do you know?
I don't know Zach.
Okay.
If you,
if,
if there's,

2662
02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:02.650
you're talking about one magical act,
let's just go hypothetical.

2663
02:28:02.651 --> 02:28:06.480
Completely one magical act.
You're saying that magic can exist.

2664
02:28:06.490 --> 02:28:09.130
Is that what you're saying?
I don't,
maybe it can't right now.

2665
02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:13.090
Maybe it did at one time.
I mean,
isn't it possible that somewhere,

2666
02:28:13.091 --> 02:28:16.060
somewhere along the line,
so I'm going to figure something fucking crazy out.

2667
02:28:16.330 --> 02:28:18.610
Just like today,
they figured out the Internet,
just like today,

2668
02:28:18.611 --> 02:28:20.980
they figured out cell phones and bullets and laser.

2669
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:27.270
<v 1>The fuck knows what do I know?
But what I do know is that you're you,</v>

2670
02:28:27.271 --> 02:28:30.830
you,
you can't make absolutes with human beings.

2671
02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:34.190
You can't tell me that you know the answers.

2672
02:28:34.191 --> 02:28:37.310
Because if you go back to a science book from 100 years ago,

2673
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:41.630
almost none of it is like a medical book,
like medical science.

2674
02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:43.310
Almost none of it is applicable.

2675
02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:46.580
Like the things that used to do to help people 200 years ago,

2676
02:28:46.581 --> 02:28:50.450
300 years ago when they were sick or nothing,
anything,
right?
That's nothing.

2677
02:28:50.451 --> 02:28:54.920
And you're counting on the word of God from people who wrote it down more than

2678
02:28:54.921 --> 02:28:58.670
2000 years ago.
And by the way,
the oldest version of it is the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2679
02:28:58.671 --> 02:29:03.530
They wrote it on animal skins and left it in fucking clay jars in the hills of

2680
02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:07.760
Qumran.
And this shit is like a thousand years old.
Or then even the,

2681
02:29:07.761 --> 02:29:10.310
the oldest version of the ancient Hebrew Bible.

2682
02:29:10.330 --> 02:29:11.390
<v 2>Well and they can't even,</v>

2683
02:29:11.530 --> 02:29:14.710
they can't even acknowledge the present day New Testament.

2684
02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:18.190
They're saying they're having a debate now about what language it was in,

2685
02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:20.230
whether it was in Greek or Aramaic.

2686
02:29:20.231 --> 02:29:24.910
So even at that point we're talking about the inability to sit down and

2687
02:29:24.911 --> 02:29:26.280
precisely time something.

2688
02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:28.240
<v 1>Yeah,
that's what a lot of people don't understand as well.</v>

2689
02:29:28.241 --> 02:29:31.630
That ancient Hebrew was also,
uh,
they didn't have numbers,

2690
02:29:31.690 --> 02:29:35.060
so like the letter a doubled as the number one.
So,

2691
02:29:35.170 --> 02:29:39.610
and then words had like numeric value,
like the word love and the word God,

2692
02:29:39.611 --> 02:29:41.380
they have the same new numeric value.

2693
02:29:41.410 --> 02:29:43.690
And that was like important for the way they wrote things.

2694
02:29:43.691 --> 02:29:47.620
They wrote things not just with letters,
but numerically it's really trippy.

2695
02:29:47.621 --> 02:29:51.490
And apparently that's all lost in the translation of the Latin and Greek.

2696
02:29:51.491 --> 02:29:52.960
And there are regional,

2697
02:29:53.610 --> 02:29:57.720
<v 2>but even Latin and Greek for example,
those ancient languages,
like,
like a Hebrew,</v>

2698
02:29:57.721 --> 02:29:59.760
Arabic,
Latin,
Greek,

2699
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:03.160
there are words that means several different things.
Sure.

2700
02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:08.170
I think it's just a testament to how basic our form of communication is that in

2701
02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:12.380
rap and lyricism,
I have to create wordplay,

2702
02:30:12.390 --> 02:30:15.060
double entendres things that have double meanings.
Dick's,
this,

2703
02:30:15.061 --> 02:30:15.920
that really means this,

2704
02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:20.940
this mansion Hebrew that a metaphor and a simile where those aren't even

2705
02:30:20.941 --> 02:30:25.040
necessarily in other languages because it's written into the actual words.
Like,

2706
02:30:25.050 --> 02:30:28.890
I could have a normal conversation with you in one of those ancient languages if

2707
02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:33.270
we were back in those times and then go,
maybe it was really fucking dumb.

2708
02:30:33.271 --> 02:30:37.440
And that's why they don't do it though.
One more.
It didn't come across right.

2709
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:40.170
But I just know English being a very basic,

2710
02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:43.720
a dramatic and Scandinavian type language,
you know what I mean?

2711
02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:45.630
That's definitely in the difference.
English.

2712
02:30:46.770 --> 02:30:48.030
<v 1>Yeah.
It's,
I wonder,</v>

2713
02:30:48.031 --> 02:30:51.180
I wonder what it would have been like to have a battle rap in ancient Hebrew.

2714
02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:55.070
<v 2>No,
but you know,
I read an interesting,
uh,
account of,
um,</v>

2715
02:30:55.410 --> 02:30:58.410
ancient Greece and Byzantium at the time and it was said that the,

2716
02:30:58.411 --> 02:30:59.940
even the emperor Justinian,

2717
02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:04.440
they were different groups the way we have a red republicans,
Blue Democrats,

2718
02:31:04.441 --> 02:31:05.370
they had the Greens.

2719
02:31:05.371 --> 02:31:09.360
And Blues back then that argued for different political factions and it said

2720
02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:13.710
within several of these books that I read that even the emperor and other people

2721
02:31:13.711 --> 02:31:18.360
participated in some of these debates where it had to be at a certain tone.

2722
02:31:18.361 --> 02:31:19.980
It had to be at a certain

2723
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.551
<v 0>tempo,</v>

2724
02:31:20.551 --> 02:31:25.551
like so in essentially they're politically battle rapping one another as a

2725
02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:31.350
speaker,
as a speech,
but it had to have rhythm to and hadn't had a poetic,

2726
02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:34.440
no kidding.
That's fascinating.
I mean what that was,

2727
02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:36.540
what do you think they rhyme things?
Is there any evidence?

2728
02:31:36.541 --> 02:31:38.070
So once the earliest evidence of people,

2729
02:31:38.071 --> 02:31:41.730
people figuring it out that it's cool to rom shit.
Probably when someone went,

2730
02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:46.260
oh no,
but I mean like what was there are,
they're really old rhymes,

2731
02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:51.640
like old poems that old poems always rhyme.
No,
I didn't drop it like it's hot.
No,

2732
02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:55.770
drops it like a time for real.
When did rhyming start?
Who figured out rhyming?

2733
02:31:56.730 --> 02:31:58.410
Have somebody,
you're a rhyming expert.

2734
02:31:58.411 --> 02:32:01.710
You should know this immortal tech who invented funny.

2735
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:05.670
That's impossible there.
We got every guide,
every monkeys laugh at each other.

2736
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:09.510
He goes to sit to the zoo and one Champa hit another chimp with a lot of words

2737
02:32:09.511 --> 02:32:12.780
sound the same.
You never know who sat.
I know,
but I wonder when the,

2738
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:14.760
the actual art of yeah,

2739
02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:19.340
<v 3>it's writing things down and making them rhyme doing and correct and doing in</v>

2740
02:32:19.341 --> 02:32:21.680
time.
Harry,
Mary.
Yeah.

2741
02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:24.800
Someone figured out that there was something cool about that because there

2742
02:32:24.801 --> 02:32:27.320
really is something cool about rhyming.
Shit.
It makes it better.

2743
02:32:27.321 --> 02:32:31.400
You gotta take a leak.
Yeah.
Straight out that door last door on the left,

2744
02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:37.870
we've got to show me yeah.
Show Friday dirty freaks and 30 Joe Diaz,
he said Yeah.

2745
02:32:37.871 --> 02:32:39.910
And Joey Diaz,
Josh Mcdermitt,
Brian Read

2746
02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:43.580
<v 0>Banh Mi and a whole lot of other people that were friends with that stopped by</v>

2747
02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:48.680
hopefully.
Um,
we don't know exactly,
uh,
what the lineup is,

2748
02:32:48.681 --> 02:32:50.590
but that's the lineup so far.
But it will be Friday night,

2749
02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:53.000
10 30 in the Ice House comedy club,

2750
02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:55.400
which is probably one of the fucking coolest spots on earth.

2751
02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:59.810
Been here since like 1950 something.
What was I just googling?

2752
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:04.240
Was I looking at,
I was talking to him about something crazy.
I don't know.

2753
02:33:04.610 --> 02:33:05.340
You don't remember?

2754
02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:10.030
<v 3>I know you pay attention,
the edible and all.
You sign up a bit after.</v>

2755
02:33:10.031 --> 02:33:12.740
I eat that edible yesterday if people like do Joe,

2756
02:33:12.741 --> 02:33:15.800
you seem like you were on drugs yesterday.
Yeah,
that,

2757
02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:21.100
that was a weird one.
I ate more of it and I forgot I was just hungry.

2758
02:33:21.101 --> 02:33:24.760
I've been eating edibles a lot lately just because I have so many edibles now.

2759
02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:29.020
I'm hungry.
I'm like,
wow,
that is a Reese's cup.
I'm hungry.

2760
02:33:29.021 --> 02:33:32.040
You should get some food in your house.
Bitch know I really said,
um,

2761
02:33:32.110 --> 02:33:35.620
but being that high and listening to honey honey was really freakish.
Oh,
I bet.

2762
02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:39.670
Holy Shit.
They were good.
Yeah,
her voice is incredible,
man.
It's just,

2763
02:33:39.671 --> 02:33:41.410
it's mind boggling.

2764
02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:44.770
They're kind of like I was saying like you're making noise with your mouth and

2765
02:33:44.771 --> 02:33:48.940
it makes people feel better.
Like some weird thing.
I would love to be able to,

2766
02:33:48.970 --> 02:33:51.820
what do you love to be able to date a girl that could play an instrument and

2767
02:33:51.821 --> 02:33:54.370
sing like that?
I think that would,
I've never done that.

2768
02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:59.200
I think it would be different.
It'd be sexy,
but yeah,
it's definitely socks.

2769
02:33:59.390 --> 02:34:02.630
She would write you a song,
you know,
you know for your birthday.

2770
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:06.130
I want to hear your fucking crazy song you wrote about me.

2771
02:34:06.131 --> 02:34:10.000
Silly bitch would have,
she was like crazy talented.

2772
02:34:10.330 --> 02:34:12.670
That would be really fucking bad for your ego.

2773
02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:16.330
Some check writing songs about you.
I think it would be amazing.

2774
02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:18.650
Yo Vain.

2775
02:34:18.650 --> 02:34:22.930
<v 0>If it was good,
like her voice was really good.
This song is about you.</v>

2776
02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:29.110
That was a bad ass bitch.
Carly Simon.
Yeah.

2777
02:34:29.111 --> 02:34:32.710
You gotta be really careful if you bang a famous singer and she writes a song

2778
02:34:32.711 --> 02:34:33.670
about your Warren Beatty.

2779
02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:37.180
People are really mad that he never answered who you thought killed.
Picky.

2780
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:41.560
Fuck those people do.
You don't have to answer that silly cod damn question.

2781
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:44.590
I got to get this is the real question is big foot reel.

2782
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.210
I think at some point he was at some point and they don't exist anymore.

2783
02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:50.860
At some point he was.
I mean,
like we say,

2784
02:34:50.861 --> 02:34:53.680
it's possible in the Pacific northwest and Ip and undiscovered primate.

2785
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:59.620
Never been there to the Pacific northwest looking for fucking prime meat,

2786
02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:00.960
but have questioned asked.

2787
02:35:00.961 --> 02:35:04.450
You definitely met some primates on the road that act at a place and you know

2788
02:35:04.451 --> 02:35:04.990
they,

2789
02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:08.500
they want to play monkey and they run into some real gorillas and I don't think

2790
02:35:08.501 --> 02:35:10.720
Dan is the same thing.
I think we're talking about a totally different,

2791
02:35:10.721 --> 02:35:12.370
no battalion definitely get the big foot.

2792
02:35:12.371 --> 02:35:15.070
They get that Sasquatch stomps as to what it is,
baby.

2793
02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:18.520
I think that's a good question to ask.
Almost anybody that comes in the podcast,

2794
02:35:18.521 --> 02:35:22.600
do they believe in bigfoot?
I started with [inaudible].
I didn't get to talk.
No.

2795
02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:27.940
I've asked like 10 people who killed.
What was their response when all the police

2796
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:32.170
that was the rolling stone said it was a rampart unit,

2797
02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:35.410
wouldn't be the first time they shot him.
No fucking with no consequences.

2798
02:35:35.411 --> 02:35:37.150
Well not only not,
it wouldn't be the first mean back then.

2799
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:40.390
You had to realize in the 1990s who essentially we were in the Non Internet age

2800
02:35:40.391 --> 02:35:44.950
people that had not changed from the old way it's shot on a strip of Vegas with,

2801
02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:48.450
yeah.
How many witnesses?
It's,

2802
02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:51.490
the Internet age has really changed a lot of shit.

2803
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:55.990
It's not as easy to just pull something off like that.
It's different.

2804
02:35:55.991 --> 02:35:58.090
It's a different world.
And I think maybe,
you know,

2805
02:35:58.091 --> 02:36:02.500
did you ever see cocaine cowboys?
Got Damn,
is that a good movie?
God Damn.

2806
02:36:02.501 --> 02:36:07.360
Is that a good movie?
Um,
and uh,
cocaine cowboys too as well.
Just as good.

2807
02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:10.930
And anyway,
when they talked about that one class,

2808
02:36:10.931 --> 02:36:15.931
the graduating class of the Miami police academy where everyone who graduated

2809
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:20.050
either wound up murdered or in jail for corruption,

2810
02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:24.820
every one of them,
they were just crazy gangsters.

2811
02:36:24.821 --> 02:36:28.900
The whole police department was karate.
That's amazing.
I mean,

2812
02:36:28.901 --> 02:36:31.150
we had some like that in Harlem called the dirty 30,

2813
02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:36.280
where they would just robbing drug dealers,
dirty cops.
They would just,

2814
02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.890
there was a saw such a gang and it was the 13th precinct dabbling.

2815
02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:44.110
I think what they did was that they would just continuously rob drug dealers,

2816
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:47.590
harass individuals from one,
and they were extorting dealers at the time.

2817
02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:49.520
She's here was crazy.
One of my,
one

2818
02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:53.940
<v 2>of my,
um,
one of my friends' fathers,
um,</v>

2819
02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:56.950
said that at a particular time,
the cops came in,

2820
02:36:57.310 --> 02:36:59.080
rated what he had and said,

2821
02:36:59.081 --> 02:37:01.960
you know what we're going to give you were taking the money,

2822
02:37:02.410 --> 02:37:05.710
but we're going to leave the stash and we're going to make sure nobody fucks

2823
02:37:05.711 --> 02:37:08.680
with you and we're going to give you extra stash here.

2824
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:12.520
We got some more smack for you.
Press up,
do whatever you want,

2825
02:37:12.970 --> 02:37:16.040
and then we'll come back and we'll take a percentage and you can have

2826
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.570
<v 1>your whatever the fuck cut.
He said,</v>

2827
02:37:17.571 --> 02:37:19.940
this went on for a couple of months and he was like,
Yo,
you know what?

2828
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:22.970
Finally I'm out of this.
He said he don't even know what happened to his friend.

2829
02:37:22.971 --> 02:37:27.020
I was into it with is with five.
Oh.
He said basically,
you know what?

2830
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:30.290
So the police made some sort of a deal where they would take a piece of the

2831
02:37:30.291 --> 02:37:33.830
action,
right?
Absolutely.
Ooh,
it's such a slippery slope.

2832
02:37:33.831 --> 02:37:37.220
If you're a competent start doing illegal shit,
you really can't stop.
I mean,

2833
02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:41.780
how do you stop and become a good cop again?
It's so hard for them to stop.
They,

2834
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:45.110
you know,
it's plus drug dealers that have done a fuck about no badge,
Homie,

2835
02:37:45.111 --> 02:37:48.250
you stole $10 million from me,
I'm going to fucking kill you.
The Bauman,

2836
02:37:48.270 --> 02:37:50.930
Nickelodeon family,
just the person.
But at the end of the day,

2837
02:37:50.931 --> 02:37:51.910
you're just a person.
And that's,

2838
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:56.510
that's the creepiest thing that a cop could think of is that they're in a gang,

2839
02:37:56.870 --> 02:38:00.320
you know,
is there gang versus your gangs?
But I mean,
keep it real.

2840
02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:02.450
That's what it is.
Kind of what it is.
You know what I mean?

2841
02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:05.030
You fuck with one of them?
They'll come get you and they're not playing.

2842
02:38:05.031 --> 02:38:08.480
You know what I mean?
Of course.
Yeah.
And you know,
that's why,

2843
02:38:08.610 --> 02:38:12.440
because that's why they look,
if they're protecting good people from crime,

2844
02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:13.303
that's all good.

2845
02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:16.340
It's when they become the people that are perpetrating the crime,

2846
02:38:16.341 --> 02:38:19.190
that that sort of a situation becomes a problem might be they become the

2847
02:38:19.191 --> 02:38:22.370
protector of those individuals.
Someone,

2848
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:25.710
someone once said that they only exist in a society where,
you know,

2849
02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:29.030
you have such a distinction between poor and rich.
You know?

2850
02:38:29.031 --> 02:38:31.790
Then if people were equal in a society that you wouldn't,

2851
02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:33.470
they wouldn't have a best friend with people.

2852
02:38:33.471 --> 02:38:37.520
Being equal is freewill and activity and the environment.

2853
02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:41.240
It's like you would have to do a lot to make people equal and it wouldn't,

2854
02:38:41.290 --> 02:38:43.400
it wouldn't involve just the people who are poor.

2855
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:45.590
It would involve everybody and it's,

2856
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:51.140
it's the process of thousands of years of human behavior.

2857
02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:53.120
It's not a simple process.

2858
02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:58.450
This people that are always going to be lazy cunts and I don't know how you fix

2859
02:38:58.521 --> 02:39:02.360
that,
but when you give people,
this is the reality of a welfare state.

2860
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:05.540
The reality of a welfare state is as a community,

2861
02:39:05.541 --> 02:39:09.980
we should always be willing to help our brothers and sisters and help people who

2862
02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:11.750
have experienced,
uh,

2863
02:39:11.780 --> 02:39:15.410
circumstances beyond their control and have a community like stand up for each

2864
02:39:15.411 --> 02:39:17.960
other.
You know,
when I,
you know,
I know people who are,

2865
02:39:17.961 --> 02:39:21.590
their houses burned down and their folks next door let him move into the

2866
02:39:21.591 --> 02:39:24.350
basement with her whole family until they rebuilt their house up again.

2867
02:39:24.351 --> 02:39:26.930
Like that kind of stuff.
It's the fucking beautiful.

2868
02:39:26.931 --> 02:39:29.900
I love hearing stuff like that.
That's human beings helping other human beings.

2869
02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:33.020
But there's a difference between that and then giving people something when

2870
02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:35.520
they're poor and they don't have to do anything for it.
That's this.

2871
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:39.740
There's a real problem with human beings and when you get people used to money

2872
02:39:39.741 --> 02:39:43.640
for nothing,
they get lazy as fuck.
They have no reason to do anything.

2873
02:39:43.641 --> 02:39:46.430
It's just natural human behavior.
It's sort of,

2874
02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:50.180
it feeds into some baby shit that you,
and so these people,

2875
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:51.680
without developing a character,

2876
02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:55.250
without develop and having everyone around them living in the same way,

2877
02:39:55.251 --> 02:39:58.580
so they're imitating their atmosphere and then having the situation where it

2878
02:39:58.581 --> 02:40:03.170
seems like there's no way out of it.
So it becomes a a point of despair,

2879
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:07.180
a point of acceptance.
And this laziness becomes harder.
Culture Buddy to Shannon,

2880
02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.110
and then in essence is kind of a microcosm for what corporations get in terms of

2881
02:40:12.111 --> 02:40:14.010
their corporate welfare.
They're used to having

2882
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:16.380
<v 0>a government that that can fucking give money to,
that going to,</v>

2883
02:40:16.381 --> 02:40:17.190
they can work with.

2884
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:20.510
They're used to being able to grease palms in order to get things passed that

2885
02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:23.620
are illegal.
Yeah.
He used to say,
oh,
this is an illegal,
well guess what?

2886
02:40:23.700 --> 02:40:27.480
What is the fucking law if you can rewrite it because then that affects millions

2887
02:40:27.481 --> 02:40:32.070
of other people's lives.
To me,
when I look at,
at at the rich poor divide,

2888
02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:35.580
it was funny,
my grandmother said some,
some funny thing to me at the table today.

2889
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:39.720
She goes,
you know,
rich people need to be in our prayers too.
And I said,
yeah.

2890
02:40:39.721 --> 02:40:42.600
He said,
Yo,
people pray for poor people all the time.
She told me,
he said,

2891
02:40:42.601 --> 02:40:46.230
but we need to pray for rich people too because unfortunately there God is money

2892
02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:47.251
and they're lost.

2893
02:40:47.251 --> 02:40:50.430
Some of them are lost and they just don't know what the hell they're doing and

2894
02:40:50.431 --> 02:40:53.850
how much they're hurting people.
Now mind you,
I'm not,
I'm not a religious,

2895
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:57.370
you know,
and it wouldn't mean,
and then they're,
they're hurting people.
But no,

2896
02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:00.660
I'm not saying they're hurting people by being rich.
But if,

2897
02:41:01.770 --> 02:41:06.770
if you think that you can just solve everything with money and that is what your

2898
02:41:07.531 --> 02:41:08.840
primary focus is,

2899
02:41:08.970 --> 02:41:11.550
because unfortunately not trying to solve everything with mine and just trying

2900
02:41:11.551 --> 02:41:12.630
to rack up a good score,

2901
02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:17.660
but it's not even that it's now they think that that particular piece of number

2902
02:41:18.841 --> 02:41:22.620
behind them makes them better than other people and in some case score and in

2903
02:41:22.621 --> 02:41:26.000
some cases they can live up.
Oh actually,
well they do.

2904
02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:29.460
They live a much better life.
Well,
it's a game.
Capitalism as a game,

2905
02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:31.260
it's not in the capitalism is not the problem.

2906
02:41:31.261 --> 02:41:33.780
It's the abandonment of humanity while pursuing capitalism.

2907
02:41:33.781 --> 02:41:36.900
It's not pursuing a game.
It's pursuing a game,

2908
02:41:36.930 --> 02:41:41.460
but without any worries about the consequences of the environment or the human

2909
02:41:41.461 --> 02:41:41.730
costs.

2910
02:41:41.730 --> 02:41:45.630
I don't think we play real capital and [inaudible] capital is involved like

2911
02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:46.980
other people that have competition.

2912
02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:50.550
When we go to a country and we engage in a kleptocracy to take over things,

2913
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:51.720
that's not real capitalism.

2914
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:55.230
They don't have their own little African diamond company that competes with

2915
02:41:55.231 --> 02:41:57.930
doctors and the rest of them.
But what they have is a monopoly.

2916
02:41:57.990 --> 02:42:02.070
They might have the semblance of what capitalism is within the confines of

2917
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:05.520
certain sectors of the United States,
but outside of this country,

2918
02:42:05.730 --> 02:42:07.530
real capitalism doesn't exist that way.

2919
02:42:07.531 --> 02:42:11.490
Our relationship with England and that capitalist relationship is the difference

2920
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:15.300
from is very different from our relationship with let's say Columbia and that

2921
02:42:15.301 --> 02:42:18.630
relationship with capitalism where we say,
we're going to prop up a state buy.

2922
02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:22.270
It doesn't matter what the human violation of human rights violations are.

2923
02:42:22.530 --> 02:42:25.050
We're just going to prop you motherfuckers up and you're going to get us what we

2924
02:42:25.051 --> 02:42:27.330
want,
which is control of the particular region.

2925
02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:30.750
You have the the the Atlantic and you have the Pacific,

2926
02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:35.820
your neighboring country comes cons.
It really comes down to behavior.

2927
02:42:35.821 --> 02:42:37.980
It comes down to the same goddamn thing.
Everywhere you go,

2928
02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:41.190
you could wrap it up and capitalism where economic gain or call,

2929
02:42:41.191 --> 02:42:42.270
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

2930
02:42:42.510 --> 02:42:46.710
The real problem is doing things at the expense of other people,

2931
02:42:46.711 --> 02:42:48.630
fucking people up.
It's not more than not.

2932
02:42:48.631 --> 02:42:52.610
People are rich and it's not the the problem with,
you know,

2933
02:42:52.660 --> 02:42:56.370
not going to have any equality until everybody's equal.
That's never,

2934
02:42:56.371 --> 02:42:59.410
no one's ever equal in this fucking world.
No one's going to be someone's,

2935
02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:01.480
someone's going to be smarter,
they're going to be fast.

2936
02:43:01.481 --> 02:43:03.600
Are they going to have a bigger dick?
There's no equal.

2937
02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:06.910
You got your fucking roll the dice don't needing to make hey mother fucker.

2938
02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:09.630
And that's,
that's what's missing in a welfare state.
And the,

2939
02:43:09.631 --> 02:43:11.980
the problem with the,
that everybody

2940
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.640
<v 1>has to equal,
no,
you have to work harder to be equal,</v>

2941
02:43:15.850 --> 02:43:19.240
but you have to also have an even playing field,
which we don't even have that.

2942
02:43:19.390 --> 02:43:23.260
So it's not even that people are impoverished and there's a direct path,

2943
02:43:23.290 --> 02:43:26.650
but people,
people who are impoverished and there's no training,

2944
02:43:26.651 --> 02:43:30.800
there's no education,
there's no protection from their environment,
that the,

2945
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:32.980
the violence of,
well,
because it comes with them,

2946
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:36.160
then there's no interest in them making,

2947
02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:39.580
making them into exactly able fact as parts of society.
You know why?

2948
02:43:39.581 --> 02:43:42.670
Because they can make money for us and the prison system and this is what we're

2949
02:43:42.671 --> 02:43:46.180
in and also make money.
See that's just because that system's in control.

2950
02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:50.920
It's been hijacked.
You can make money from having,
look if you have money,

2951
02:43:51.010 --> 02:43:55.500
big money for defense contractors in Iraq and rebuilding companies like you
know,

2952
02:43:55.580 --> 02:43:56.440
like Halliburton,

2953
02:43:56.441 --> 02:43:59.830
they come in and build shit back up after we blow it the fuck apart.

2954
02:43:59.980 --> 02:44:03.580
Well then you could also have big contracts to see shape up ghettos.

2955
02:44:03.730 --> 02:44:06.280
You could have the same kind of build Detroit.

2956
02:44:06.281 --> 02:44:09.370
Exactly have the same kind of money involved in,

2957
02:44:09.371 --> 02:44:12.970
in putting forth some sort of an effort to,
to,

2958
02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:17.740
to fulfill their potential of young human beings,

2959
02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:21.040
to take young human beings in any sort of impoverished area where they don't

2960
02:44:21.041 --> 02:44:22.540
have a whole lot to look forward to.

2961
02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:25.630
They don't have a whole lot of options and provide those.

2962
02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:30.250
I've always said you want to strengthen the country,
make less losers.
Okay,

2963
02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:33.550
that's the,
you want less people robbing people,
less people in jail,

2964
02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:34.810
more people producing.

2965
02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:38.530
The only way to do that is to take care of the most important resource we have.

2966
02:44:38.531 --> 02:44:42.190
And that's young people.
That's babies,
that's children.
That's the lie.

2967
02:44:42.310 --> 02:44:44.890
And where's the life becoming the most fucked up?
Is it?

2968
02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:47.320
Well in the most impoverished areas,
it's the most difficult.

2969
02:44:47.321 --> 02:44:50.230
It's harder to get away from the grime,
the crime and the gangs and all.
Well,

2970
02:44:50.231 --> 02:44:54.370
we need to correct them and no politician has ever lifted a fucking finger for

2971
02:44:54.371 --> 02:44:56.140
that because they can't make money.

2972
02:44:56.290 --> 02:44:59.230
We have to figure out a way to make money and fixing things that we have to

2973
02:44:59.231 --> 02:45:02.230
figure out a way.
We're Halliburton gets on mushrooms and they go,

2974
02:45:02.231 --> 02:45:05.890
we're going to rebuild kiddos instead of going over to fucking Iraq and blowing

2975
02:45:05.891 --> 02:45:09.850
shit up and then rebuilding it back.
Let's rebuild,
you know,
rebuild the ghettos.

2976
02:45:09.930 --> 02:45:10.180
I think

2977
02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:14.920
<v 0>the problem is that even if you wanted to do,
and even if they agree to do it,</v>

2978
02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:17.800
they would always be some kind of hidden agenda there.

2979
02:45:17.801 --> 02:45:21.660
Like you know we're going to use,
because they're not on mushrooms,
mushrooms,

2980
02:45:22.030 --> 02:45:25.570
we're going to rebuild the ghetto so that we can turn all of these kids that are

2981
02:45:25.571 --> 02:45:28.250
coming out of here.
Fucking soldiers comments.

2982
02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:31.090
If you want to con you wouldn't do that.
So it goes back to my thing.

2983
02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.700
Don't be a beer gut.
That's everything.
That is everything.

2984
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:37.090
It's the blue that doesn't teach that shit to put on a t shirt.

2985
02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:39.750
Somebody else do it right and they make some money.
No,

2986
02:45:39.751 --> 02:45:42.610
not just get like a little Buddha right down to teach.
It says,
Buddha says,

2987
02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:45.250
Don [inaudible] says,
I'm going back.
Don't be a con.

2988
02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:46.990
I think I'm going to have an American flag one.

2989
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:50.410
And so it was going to say we're America and we're not comment because I think

2990
02:45:50.411 --> 02:45:53.470
that's even better.
That's the perfect ideal.
Everybody looks at America,

2991
02:45:53.471 --> 02:45:55.720
we don't look at it and man,
I'm an American.
And then the back it says,

2992
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:57.340
but I'm not a cut that too,

2993
02:45:57.820 --> 02:46:00.760
but I think it's better to say it all in one sentence where America and we're

2994
02:46:00.761 --> 02:46:04.530
not,
or we have the best clients do we?

2995
02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:09.290
I don't think we've done girl cuts.
Brazil's got us beat.
No,
maybe Japan.

2996
02:46:09.291 --> 02:46:13.790
It's dirty.

3022
02:47:32.381 --> 02:47:35.790
When you have your own documentary man.
