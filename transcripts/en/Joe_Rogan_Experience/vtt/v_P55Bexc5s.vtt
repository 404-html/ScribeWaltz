00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I put this in my mct oil is a </v>

2
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>good idea or bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long are we going to dogs?</v>

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how long you can hold back </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood gates of hell.</v>

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a coconut emulsified.</v>

5
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Mct Oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never talk to you.</v>

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Com does not look like that and it </v>

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>definitely doesn't keep that well in </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic.</v>

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Dean White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so healthy.</v>

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating a lot of organic food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much change too.</v>

10
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>When my comlex wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like elmers glue.</v>

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not too much at all.</v>

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>This is nothing wrong with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

13
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just tuned in.</v>

14
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 1>There was no other way to tune in now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unless a bug,</v>

15
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the studio recording us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:54.801
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drama behind taking too much mct </v>

17
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.311
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a feeling that you get like a </v>

18
00:00:58.311 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>water bubble pops in your stomach.</v>

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

20
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abortion.</v>

22
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>There's some ribs crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something goes wrong and then you must </v>

23
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>get to the toilet immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why I was,</v>

24
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:15.951
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whether or not it's like the oil </v>

25
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.951
<v Speaker 1>itself where it lubricates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make any sense because </v>

26
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>a lot of water comes out of your body to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another.</v>

27
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do colonics?</v>

28
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good for you ever.</v>

29
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

30
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Placebo effect is a measurable effect.</v>

31
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think it's good for you,</v>

32
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is or I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

33
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I have done a couple and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do them anymore.</v>

34
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first got money I was like,</v>

35
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't pay guys to like put things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my bat.</v>

36
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So a guy did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy did it weird.</v>

37
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>because I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

39
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.911
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know putting things in my butt was </v>

40
00:01:58.911 --> 00:01:58.911
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

41
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird paying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone I at least feel like I have a </v>

42
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>modicum of control and can actually sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of set boundaries.</v>

43
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many weird things going on.</v>

44
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to isolate what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable about.</v>

45
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I feel like putting things in the bud is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot like Catholic school girls in that</v>

46
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>suppression is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what creates the diamond,</v>

47
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

48
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

49
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because he did find a diamond</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

50
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>He flushed me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by that is,</v>

51
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were kids,</v>

52
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>we all knew the Catholic school girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like the biggest hose because they </v>

53
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>had the repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pendulum has to swing.</v>

54
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't hang to the right to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium horse.</v>

56
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholics.</v>

57
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I know I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus did for a bunch of years,</v>

58
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.561
<v Speaker 1>but a five slash six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>

59
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean my fate was sealed away before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic school.</v>

60
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>It was just like my excuse for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

61
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>but I went to Catholic school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not why I was a mazda</v>

62
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>way before then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it weirdly.</v>

63
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:07.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so much transgression </v>

64
00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:10.080
<v Speaker 2>within the Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was getting in trouble because </v>

65
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>they were all sort of rebelling against </v>
<v Speaker 2>forbidden.</v>

66
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It is forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the buck,</v>

67
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 2>but sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

68
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny you put it in there.</v>

69
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 2>It's funny you said that because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about you during,</v>

70
00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 2>but Zach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

71
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about like,</v>

72
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 2>because because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming on the show tomorrow and I </v>

73
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 2>felt like La the last couple times I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show is like,</v>

74
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I was in a weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was talking about like,</v>

75
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.600
<v Speaker 2>like I just come back from Vietnam with </v>
<v Speaker 2>deformed babies and,</v>

76
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it going to go that way or were you </v>

77
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.560
<v Speaker 2>talking about deformed babies again </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm out of deformed babies </v>

78
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.830
<v Speaker 2>stories and I was at the gym last night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know it's obvious.</v>

79
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a La Fitness,</v>

80
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I go to La fitness because I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and I can afford $28 a month,</v>

81
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was in the bathroom just like,</v>

82
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

83
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 2>And I heard this girl on the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

84
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see someone pacing on the phone</v>

85
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

86
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 2>that's like a business call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

87
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I just incapable of minding my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

88
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.490
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was also yelling and she goes,</v>

89
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

90
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the phone.</v>

91
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't really get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only been asked to do one anal </v>

93
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

94
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like I'm lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds like the stories ally,</v>

95
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I've only been asked to do one anal </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>

96
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.250
<v Speaker 2>It went on and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't make any sense because I </v>

97
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 2>don't do anal on my personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really tight.</v>

98
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 2>This happened in the La fitness locker </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and I was just like,</v>

99
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I was a gog for many reasons and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that that will be like </v>

100
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>standard in La that you'd run into porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars you think?</v>

101
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure we do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear them talking to their,</v>

102
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear them negotiating deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this went on for quite a long time.</v>

103
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 2>She did talk about when her rent was </v>
<v Speaker 2>due.</v>

104
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in there for quite a while </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just made me think about how </v>

105
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 2>grateful I am that I don't do porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do porn.</v>

106
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing to be grateful for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend of mine who,</v>

107
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his buddy was dating a porn star and it </v>

108
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 3>was like no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no big deal.</v>

109
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 3>We all have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No big deal.</v>

110
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one day the straw that broke </v>

111
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>the camel's back was she was going over </v>
<v Speaker 3>her contract and he was,</v>

112
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 3>apparently they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually asked.</v>

113
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 3>They have contracts sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they always do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the contract it said air tight </v>

115
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's airtight?</v>

116
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a guy in every hole.</v>

117
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

118
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're done.</v>

119
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 3>It's over APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was that.</v>

120
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Was it just a one in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the plugs you want on the mound?</v>

121
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

122
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't stop thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.550
<v Speaker 2>because I was of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had just,</v>

124
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>we had been about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back from</v>

125
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Tulsa and I had a connection and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

126
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I've like what Bill Hicks used to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

127
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>a flying saucer tour in the places only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're flying saucers go.</v>

128
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Hicks used to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would do the south.</v>

129
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>We do the flying saucer tourists because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's same as you.</v>

130
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.290
<v Speaker 1>That's how he would work out and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go to these like weird road </v>

131
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it the kidnapped comedy tour,</v>

132
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>which is what I'm leaving the airport </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the driver.</v>

133
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being kidnapped,</v>

134
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I truly don't know if there's no</v>

135
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:33.821
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were just like in the middle </v>

136
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:35.801
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm either going to go to a casino and </v>

137
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:35.801
<v Speaker 1>do stand up or get murdered brutally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a field.</v>

138
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he knows I did a casino.</v>

139
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>My Mommy's got bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mommy's got a lot of bills to pay.</v>

141
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

142
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>in this girl she just went on and on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

143
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said something.</v>

144
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like a,</v>

145
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't make any sense because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do anal in my personal life.</v>

146
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

147
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.420
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was so interesting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a porn star had boundaries in her </v>

148
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>personal life and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she'll do it on camera,</v>

149
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of.</v>

150
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It made me think about my boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

151
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>this girl has stronger boundaries than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

152
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

153
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a preference issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

154
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Like some girls are actually like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a bizarre thing I've had.</v>

155
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I've had it come up on stage before </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people will like raise their hands</v>

156
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:19.500
<v Speaker 1>and say I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

157
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna I'm not gonna chime in too</v>

158
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>much on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

159
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

160
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I think some people just like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty too.</v>

161
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 1>They like to be a dirty girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know when sex got so </v>

162
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just regular old set.</v>

163
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's got to be so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now gets a lot of it is who you're doing</v>

164
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're doing it to them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

167
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you really like them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to like you both are </v>

168
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 1>mutually enamored with each other or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental connection to get them to be </v>

169
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>enamored with you animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We didn't have trust.</v>

173
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

174
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.520

<v Speaker 1>We just so desensitized from porn.</v>

175
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.930

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

176
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:13.931
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely that 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this bit in my act now about </v>

177
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.231
<v Speaker 1>the loss of pubic hair that there was at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point in time people just had pubic </v>

178
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>hair and now it just seems like women </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have pubic hair anymore.</v>

179
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it lasered off five years ago and </v>

<v Speaker 1>So drinking hot tea just tried to stay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's interesting you say that.</v>

186
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is more like a family,</v>

187
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:56.021
<v Speaker 1>like acquaintance and she's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter who's 15 who had her first </v>

188
00:08:56.021 --> 00:08:56.060
<v Speaker 1>sexual experience at it was,</v>

189
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they had sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a man's man,</v>

190
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.230
<v Speaker 2>a boy her age saw her naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no legal issues.</v>

191
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 2>There was no like don't call her most </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorities.</v>

192
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:09.741
<v Speaker 2>Normal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She came home hysterically crying after </v>

193
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:13.191
<v Speaker 2>her first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A teenage boy saw her naked because he </v>

194
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>saw her private area and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

195
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 2>He had never seen pubic hair before </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had only seen porn.</v>

196
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had never seen a Lavia before </v>

197
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 2>because in a lot of porn they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>labioplasty,</v>

198
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.510
<v Speaker 2>so he sees this like horrific chicken </v>
<v Speaker 2>gizzards.</v>

199
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.550
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that she's deformed or has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant skin tag because in porn they </v>

200
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:42.861
<v Speaker 2>don't have a lot of it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comment that they get their Libya </v>

201
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>chopped cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see a vagina and porn that does</v>

202
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:49.371
<v Speaker 2>not have the orchid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an elephant ear,</v>

203
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>whatever catcher's Mitt for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching porn.</v>

204
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's apparently the most popular.</v>

205
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

206
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the theory getting reason?</v>

207
00:10:04.421 --> 00:10:09.421
<v Speaker 2>Why Ron?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy was a big time porn star because </v>

208
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:10.270
<v Speaker 2>like people looked at Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy fucking these girls and they were</v>

209
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

210
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I've run aspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like Ryan Reynolds.</v>

211
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like I kind of looked like Ron </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy and he's getting laid.</v>

212
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 2>He wears a shirt and his born and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see these,</v>

213
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 2>these women that are like 45 and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>do what I could get her.</v>

214
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.420
<v Speaker 2>She's in my living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an apartment forced.</v>

215
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm married to what a crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's right over there.</v>

216
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe just like movies,</v>

217
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 2>there's like aspirational and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

218
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatable.</v>

219
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Relatable I think is a big factor with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>MILF.</v>

220
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess for me I can,</v>

221
00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this is my being a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's being a comic,</v>

222
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's having a hyperactive </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amygdala.</v>

223
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I watch porn it's really hard </v>

224
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.891
<v Speaker 2>for me to separate what I'm looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>from how the person got there and when </v>

225
00:10:55.921 --> 00:11:00.921
<v Speaker 2>they're young I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's an idiot and she had a bad </v>

226
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 2>childhood and it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they're older in lessons,</v>

227
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Jenna Jamison or someone who's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for a long time,</v>

228
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who at 43 starts doing its just too </v>

229
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>tragic for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jump off,</v>

230
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:16.011
<v Speaker 2>like how do you jump off the train and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you decide you've had enough </v>

231
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>years on the ride?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

232
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 2>that would be the issue is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it because they're sending so many of</v>

233
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 2>them are on drugs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and had bad childhoods.</v>

234
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:24.540
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

235
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 2>The only point I really am able to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the so like Tom,</v>

236
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tumbler Tumbler,</v>

237
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>tumbler has great porn because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>an increments of like eight seconds.</v>

238
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Tumblr is porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

239
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like teenagers blogs about </v>

240
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.151
<v Speaker 2>twilight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pinterest type collections of furniture </v>

241
00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

242
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a gif files.</v>

243
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also like some porn ones </v>

244
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.750
<v Speaker 2>that are sort of tasteful and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>an increment of eight seconds and it </v>

245
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.441
<v Speaker 2>just replays it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have time to see the bad </v>

246
00:11:58.441 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 2>furniture in the background or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 2>like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get distracted by the,</v>

248
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 2>the decor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bed.</v>

249
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

250
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Ikea.</v>

251
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not assembled properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get distracted so easily.</v>

252
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Like if a girl's got a tattoo on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>thigh,</v>

253
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 2>all I can think about is where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna look like in 20 years.</v>

254
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't separate enjoying porn from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the porn stars,</v>

255
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 2>bad decisions and I get worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

256
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 2>So this is good because it's eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and I can't.</v>

257
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.560
<v Speaker 2>My mind can't wander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

258
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And they have some that are black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>

259
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already.</v>

260
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 2>And it always looks consensual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really get turned on.</v>

261
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 2>But because I can tell when a girl is </v>
<v Speaker 2>faking,</v>

262
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I can tell I've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>

263
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

264
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 2>So when a girl is just like overdoing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>

265
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sort of like a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is</v>

266
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:49.010
<v Speaker 3>a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The overwhelming number of people that </v>

267
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:52.890
<v Speaker 3>watch other people have sex and </v>
<v Speaker 3>masturbate in history,</v>

268
00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:57.891
<v Speaker 3>in the history of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has never been more people </v>

269
00:12:57.891 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 3>masturbating to other people having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's triggered.</v>

270
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also I've gotten kind of obsessed </v>

271
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.100
<v Speaker 2>with this because I recently did a movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

272
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do stuff you do like focus </v>

273
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.200
<v Speaker 2>group testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a scene in the movie where</v>

274
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Blake Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basketball player,</v>

275
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.060
<v Speaker 2>really funny actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's great in it,</v>

276
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.340
<v Speaker 2>is with successfully strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're married.</v>

277
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.090
<v Speaker 2>And the scene was that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote it with Neal Brennan actually,</v>

278
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.070
<v Speaker 2>that he walks in on his wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating in what that is,</v>

279
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like women walking on men,</v>

280
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt guys rate all the time.</v>

281
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:33.290
<v Speaker 2>But how he takes it personally and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

282
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a threat to his masculinity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and manhood and he's insulted and his </v>

283
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 2>feelings are hurt and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

284
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.400
<v Speaker 2>so she's at a table and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer and that's the deal.</v>

285
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I guess I just put my own experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

286
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

287
00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I just assume everyone masturbates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way to the same things,</v>

288
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:52.910
<v Speaker 2>the same vibe when we played it for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus groups,</v>

289
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone was so confused about what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on when he comes in and sees her </v>

290
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.861
<v Speaker 2>at the desk with her hands under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table with the computer and then she </v>

291
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 2>throws the computer down and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked out.</v>

292
00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:07.010
<v Speaker 2>And to me it's very obvious that she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating in the scene,</v>

293
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the focus groups.</v>

294
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.190
<v Speaker 2>This one guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

295
00:14:10.191 --> 00:14:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea she was masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

296
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 2>wherever the candles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

297
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.760
<v Speaker 2>what you like kit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody masturbates so </v>

298
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.391
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that dude masturbates with </v>

299
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 2>candles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have a ceremonial,</v>

300
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>because I thought all guys masturbate </v>
<v Speaker 2>under a bridge where they belong and </v>

301
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.301
<v Speaker 2>then the wind were even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One woman was like,</v>

302
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea she was masturbating </v>

303
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 2>because she wasn't in the tub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so specific.</v>

304
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:48.271
<v Speaker 2>Masturbate in your own soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

305
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

306
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what I feel about tubs</v>

307
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.190
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not really even totally clean </v>

308
00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.730
<v Speaker 1>your pussy and asshole soup here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making tea.</v>

309
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.720
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take a shower after you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a bath and you're making tea.</v>

310
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Puts her pussy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just this.</v>

311
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're comics so I'm fascinated by like </v>

312
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.760
<v Speaker 1>people's deep dark secrets and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like masturbation is that lab.</v>

313
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>We show our lives to everyone on social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

314
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:16.950
<v Speaker 1>You know what I eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where Mike,</v>

315
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.060
<v Speaker 1>your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

316
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't really do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people,</v>

317
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing we don't know about </v>

318
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they masturbate.</v>

319
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also it highlights the problem </v>

320
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.771
<v Speaker 1>with those focus groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those focus groups are filled with </v>

321
00:15:29.771 --> 00:15:33.341
<v Speaker 1>morons because most people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a person who needs $50 cash right </v>

322
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:37.180
<v Speaker 1>now and we'll go watch a movie in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley for 50 bucks.</v>

323
00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:38.260
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to this,</v>

324
00:15:38.261 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

325
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking normal.</v>

326
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not human.</v>

327
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>But you know the people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it with.</v>

328
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>

329
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I have a complicated relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus groups because we're comics.</v>

330
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:52.991
<v Speaker 1>I love anonymous strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feedback is how I seek the truth and </v>

331
00:15:52.991 --> 00:15:57.460
<v Speaker 1>that's who I listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would rather anonymous strangers </v>

332
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 1>feedback than like a network executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like got all these,</v>

333
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of preconceived ideas of what a</v>

334
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:08.651
<v Speaker 1>show should be like based on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulaic thing that worked 10 years </v>

335
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:08.651
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

336
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I let the involuntary laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to me where the truth is.</v>

337
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:15.581
<v Speaker 1>So I have a complicated relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with focus groups because I really do </v>

338
00:16:15.581 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>trust strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you kind of have to,</v>

339
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a weird art forum in that we're </v>

341
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:28.241
<v Speaker 1>one of the very few art forms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires other people to make it form </v>

342
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>people we've never met and know nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and put complete trust in.</v>

343
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't do that,</v>

393
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:34.230
<v Speaker 2>flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I had sort of an Aha moment </v>

394
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 2>when one of my specials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on comedy central.</v>

395
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:39.801
<v Speaker 2>You kind of find out who you are based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on who buys advertising time on your </v>

396
00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:39.801
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the focus group thing.</v>

402
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.910
<v Speaker 2>I just can't imagine that no one would </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that a woman with her hands </v>

403
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 2>in her pants watching a computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be masturbating.</v>

404
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.320
<v Speaker 2>They were very confused and less guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume that women don't masturbate to </v>

405
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.320

<v Speaker 2>I just think guys assume that since we </v>

441
00:20:39.201 --> 00:20:41.811
<v Speaker 2>give birth in that such a shocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of pain that we can endure </v>

<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well there's something that happens in </v>

444
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:46.420
<v Speaker 2>porn for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they escalate,</v>

445
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>where it used to be just people</v>

446
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 3>having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to old porn,</v>

447
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 3>it would be like a secretary and a boss </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm so tense and the guy gives her a</v>

448
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:55.020
<v Speaker 3>back massage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>

449
00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 3>they're having just regular sex and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the line it became like </v>

450
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.330
<v Speaker 3>gagging and slapping and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>coughing</v>

451
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.030
<v Speaker 2>from one to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is super dangerous.</v>

452
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.660
<v Speaker 2>A Uti wait is septic infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can think of.</v>

453
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Stuff that's like you should not do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>real life.</v>

454
00:21:11.781 --> 00:21:13.280
<v Speaker 2>It's they're really setting a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

455
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Terrible example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess who's having to suffer this guy?</v>

456
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 2>It's us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the ones that have to be like me </v>

457
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 2>and then we're like,</v>

459
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 2>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a.</v>

460
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 2>What point did you watch today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

461
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.660
<v Speaker 2>what am I getting hit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I getting what I.</v>

462
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 2>can you please teach me Jujitsu just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get through.</v>

463
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:37.170
<v Speaker 3>That's going to take along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something you can teach </v>

464
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.811
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like this is the letter a and </v>

465
00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:39.811
<v Speaker 3>cursive.</v>

466
00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this because I </v>

467
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.091
<v Speaker 2>always am trying to equate like our </v>
<v Speaker 2>primordial instincts that we have not </v>

468
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:50.101
<v Speaker 2>evolved past and with modern technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and alarm systems and how we get out </v>

469
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 2>those impulses in the modern world like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

470
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 2>did you hear about these food trucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were in downtown la?</v>

471
00:21:56.801 --> 00:22:01.801
<v Speaker 2>They're like these awesome food trucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>who in everyday or at a different </v>

472
00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 2>location and guys go on twitter to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they are and they go,</v>

473
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hunting,</v>

474
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the closest thing these guys have</v>

475
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 2>done hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're not you.</v>

476
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird way of thinking,</v>

477
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

478
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I never equated that before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess kind of if men have a </v>

479
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 2>primordial need to chase things and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill and slay or whatever it is.</v>

480
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 2>So if there's an inherent need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>

481
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people don't get to do what you do </v>

482
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people that you talk to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they.</v>

483
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I guess here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do people who get the impulse to fight </v>

484
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 2>out either professionally or </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreationally,</v>

485
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:39.000
<v Speaker 2>are they less violence sexually?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do they not need to do,</v>

486
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 2>does it have to come out somewhere?</v>

487
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine they would be less </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence actually.</v>

488
00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they get that.</v>

489
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine there'd be less violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>overall agree because they get to purge </v>

490
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:50.360
<v Speaker 3>it somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

491
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.850
<v Speaker 3>And well I think road rage when you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in road rage incidents,</v>

492
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Speaker 3>the likelihood of them coming straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a Jujitsu class and having road </v>

493
00:22:59.680 --> 00:22:59.840
<v Speaker 3>rage is almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

494
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Because when I'm coming home from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and someone cuts me off,</v>

495
00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dick,</v>

496
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.760
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duke.</v>

497
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.690
<v Speaker 3>So much.</v>

498
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what your threshold is for how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much violence or not even violence.</v>

499
00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what testosterone,</v>

500
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:16.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More tension than releasing it.</v>

501
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more.</v>

502
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Most people never get to release it.</v>

503
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't.</v>

504
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:25.231
<v Speaker 3>And I think our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always describe our bodies as like a </v>

505
00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:27.841
<v Speaker 3>leaky battery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have a certain amount of reward </v>

506
00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:28.720
<v Speaker 3>systems that are built into our bodies </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and flight and worrying about,</v>

507
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to gather food and worrying about </v>

508
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:33.980
<v Speaker 3>incoming tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to rape and kill us.</v>

509
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think those,</v>

510
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:39.390
<v Speaker 3>those things are just ingrained in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>DNA and they don't get met or even </v>

511
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>addressed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In modern society where you have A.</v>

512
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine was a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>

513
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.920
<v Speaker 3>His neck is all fucked up and</v>

514
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>he works at a desk all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

515
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't hardly exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does look a little bit of exercise.</v>

516
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

517
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 2>your body has demands and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting it,</v>

518
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:57.480
<v Speaker 2>but just sit in there with shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>posture at your desk.</v>

519
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Sitting is the new smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

520
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:01.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it is?</v>

521
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why we're in these chairs.</v>

522
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.790
<v Speaker 2>These things are called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're from Ergo depot.</v>

523
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be really numb.</v>

524
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Then you would need a slap down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very distracting.</v>

525
00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are forcing you to sit like this,</v>

526
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they noticed it.</v>

527
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Underwire bra today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that forces me to do that.</v>

528
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Pushes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>

529
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:32.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's like three harpoons that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just.</v>

530
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:35.910
<v Speaker 2>And if you move they sort of Jam India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

531
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it a posture thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

532
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:43.150
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a masochism misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lingerie.</v>

533
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.380
<v Speaker 2>So just to make your tits perky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

534
00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done laundry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my cleaning lady,</v>

535
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 2>so I'm improvising and wearing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wouldn't normally wear and I </v>

536
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.771
<v Speaker 2>can't believe women wear this all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because I normally don't wear </v>

537
00:24:56.771 --> 00:24:56.771
<v Speaker 2>underwire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

538
00:24:56.771 --> 00:24:56.771
<v Speaker 2>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

539
00:24:56.771 --> 00:25:01.661
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Support Bras actually support your </v>

540
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 2>breasts and keep them from starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sag?</v>

541
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like any part of the skit,</v>

542
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hold something up.</v>

543
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:13.181
<v Speaker 2>So I know a lot of women who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>pendulous breasts who went to sleep so </v>

544
00:25:13.181 --> 00:25:17.351
<v Speaker 2>that they don't fully get beaten down by</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity and then you have a cadence if </v>

545
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you go Africa style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just.</v>

546
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way around that.</v>

547
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you were a sport,</v>

548
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.460
<v Speaker 2>this is just more like I normally never </v>
<v Speaker 2>wear underwire,</v>

549
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes me a bad person,</v>

550
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.900
<v Speaker 2>but because you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

551
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 2>it's just uncomfortable.</v>

552
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to thongs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten numb in that area and just </v>

553
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:40.620
<v Speaker 2>had to acquiesce to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

554
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.630
<v Speaker 2>your butt crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

555
00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:47.631
<v Speaker 2>it's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically there's a certain type </v>

556
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 2>of you getting so used to my throat </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

557
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.640
<v Speaker 2>mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

558
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.900
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have gotten so it's amazing and I'm </v>

559
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:55.900
<v Speaker 2>just always fascinated by and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing it,</v>

560
00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone's sort of Zeitgeisty </v>

561
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:00.760
<v Speaker 2>word right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normalization or desensitization.</v>

562
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.531
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with how we acclimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's our human instinct </v>

563
00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 2>to acclimate to some kind of pain or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower tolerance to,</v>

564
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with a consistent pain or </v>

565
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.881
<v Speaker 2>discomfort or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sort of have this amazing ability to </v>

566
00:26:15.881 --> 00:26:17.100
<v Speaker 2>adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

567
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't wear thongs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't wear thongs.</v>

568
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I was resisting and resisting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally started wearing them.</v>

569
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:27.191
<v Speaker 2>They were so uncomfortable for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>months and then I forgot I had went on </v>

570
00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:28.260
<v Speaker 2>and peed through one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once that's through,</v>

571
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.340
<v Speaker 2>through one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat down on the toilet.</v>

572
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Just thought you were naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How little I felt it you on any kind of </v>

573
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.350
<v Speaker 2>medication at this time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

574
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:40.121
<v Speaker 2>I should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really should have been on anti </v>

575
00:26:40.121 --> 00:26:40.121
<v Speaker 2>psychotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you pete.</v>

576
00:26:40.121 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I got the super light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Cammo ones.</v>

577
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Actually under armour makes them more </v>
<v Speaker 2>like workout ones that are are,</v>

578
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 2>they're called Cammo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

579
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not like a</v>

580
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.190
<v Speaker 1>camouflage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

581
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

582
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Under armour makes a lot of hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>gear.</v>

583
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it now?</v>

584
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that they started making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started.</v>

585
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.030
<v Speaker 1>They did not have to be the face of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

586
00:27:01.031 --> 00:27:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you wanted to try a new career,</v>

587
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it was looking for women to get involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hunting.</v>

588
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

589
00:27:07.721 --> 00:27:10.330
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big thing like pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls don't go hunting.</v>

590
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that sexy?</v>

591
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people think it is,</v>

592
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

593
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:19.690
<v Speaker 1>is unusual to see these girls with full </v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup on,</v>

594
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.330
<v Speaker 1>with like really well applied camera on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their face.</v>

595
00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:27.331
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have like a deadline next </v>

596
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:30.481
<v Speaker 1>to them and then they don't take these </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook photos and it gets really </v>

597
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:30.481
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a girl,</v>

598
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty famous for it because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a cheerleader in Texas and she shot </v>

599
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.740
<v Speaker 1>in Lyon and like Ricky Gervais' and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people went crazy on,</v>

600
00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:39.610
<v Speaker 1>you're attacking her.</v>

601
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.800
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it became the Kendall Jenner,</v>

602
00:27:41.801 --> 00:27:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I think is her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was that famous Kardashians?</v>

603
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.350
<v Speaker 1>My right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might.</v>

604
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.130
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no kindle something or.</v>

605
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the most endearing ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

606
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.020
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendall Jones Jones is pretty close.</v>

607
00:27:59.050 --> 00:27:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:27:59.561 --> 00:28:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so out of the loop.</v>

609
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Someone was trying to explore you in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians loop.</v>

610
00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one's the one that had the.</v>

611
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the girl with the lion.</v>

612
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>

613
00:28:09.311 --> 00:28:14.311
<v Speaker 1>So there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something weird about like this </v>

614
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:14.311
<v Speaker 1>picture right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

615
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:14.311
<v Speaker 1>look at this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look at.</v>

616
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ruined like my week.</v>

617
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fun.</v>

618
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Sexy pose with a bow in a deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

620
00:28:26.141 --> 00:28:28.330
<v Speaker 1>that lion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

621
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:29.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines up with.</v>

622
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird thing about the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions thing too,</v>

623
00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:34.780
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in these high fence places where</v>

624
00:28:34.781 --> 00:28:36.490
<v Speaker 1>they go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These lines are kind of trapped in these</v>

625
00:28:36.491 --> 00:28:41.491
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they actually released a </v>

626
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:42.430
<v Speaker 1>line the day of the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's line had been in a cage,</v>

627
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Scott release the line and this woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out and shoots the.</v>

628
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that was the case with </v>

629
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:50.480
<v Speaker 1>her person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever,</v>

630
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we'll go out and shoot the </v>

631
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.261
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The line literally has no idea what's </v>

632
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:55.261
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a free range line.</v>

633
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>So to me that's a mentally ill person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my question for you is that,</v>

635
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 2>is there something primordial about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think,</v>

636
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

637
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I think inherently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is going to sound wrong or it's</v>

638
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.060
<v Speaker 2>going to sound like feminist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

639
00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 2>but like there's a lot of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a matriarchal species,</v>

640
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:21.231
<v Speaker 2>not that women should have more power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that were sort of designed to like </v>

641
00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Orca whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lions,</v>

642
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:24.180
<v Speaker 2>like female lions do all the hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men just,</v>

643
00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not economical for their energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're so big to do hunting.</v>

644
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to kill him twice as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>food or whatever they for protection.</v>

645
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

646
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking and whatever.</v>

647
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.600
<v Speaker 2>So is there something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

648
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.820
<v Speaker 2>some sort of reptilian attraction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing a woman go hunt food even though </v>

649
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.240
<v Speaker 2>it's ironically a lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

650
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

651
00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Is it like watching a woman cook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a woman cook is probably sexy,</v>

652
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 2>but is watching them hunt the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

653
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

654
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe it's just maybe a varies.</v>

655
00:29:52.261 --> 00:29:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more in lines of watching a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman cage fight.</v>

656
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some really pretty women.</v>

657
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.300
<v Speaker 2>The fight now is that because I'm always</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of in this thing and people always </v>

658
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 2>tell me like I have Alpha vibe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not sexy to men or it is.</v>

659
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Or is it case by case or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generalization?</v>

660
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm just always interested.</v>

661
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you are is powerful and </v>

662
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 3>that's scary to people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>insecure.</v>

663
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.230
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a go getter.</v>

664
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly doing things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like.</v>

665
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that a guy who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>test himself or a person who's not </v>

666
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 3>accomplished would be very insecure </v>
<v Speaker 3>around someone who's got more,</v>

667
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.990
<v Speaker 3>more ambition and more drive and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>irons in the fire than they do so they </v>

668
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.210
<v Speaker 3>would feel insecure insignia,</v>

669
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my engine is insecurity.</v>

670
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.460
<v Speaker 2>It is ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

671
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what fuels the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you were secure,</v>

672
00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 2>would you be as ambitious or would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>be exactly the same?</v>

673
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can even entertain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

674
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Hypothetical [inaudible] the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being secure so far.</v>

675
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 2>What if someone came out with a security</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill?</v>

676
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he took that back.</v>

677
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 2>If they have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a chatterbox pill.</v>

678
00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

679
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so let's start a business.</v>

680
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

681
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to go into business together.</v>

682
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I've got a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but amazing.</v>

683
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I know I is a co op.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one working with vitamin company </v>

684
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.510
<v Speaker 2>branding out of China.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>

687
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even heard someone refer to you as your </v>

688
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:24.600
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

690
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 2>That's such a bizarre way of putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

691
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It's got such a pejorative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

692
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.840
<v Speaker 2>but we're comics so we have an allergy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to anything corny like we can say with </v>

693
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say it,</v>

694
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 2>but we have to do it with like an eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll,</v>

695
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:40.450
<v Speaker 2>like you have a very strong brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

696
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 2>but part of your brand is not being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who goes,</v>

697
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 2>me and my brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my brand is not having a brand.</v>

698
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.470
<v Speaker 2>You do have one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess incredibly strong,</v>

699
00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:53.700
<v Speaker 2>clear one that anybody could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.360
<v Speaker 2>like say in one sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of it is because you're so </v>

701
00:31:59.360 --> 00:31:59.950
<v Speaker 2>authentic and anti,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

702
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>

703
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 2>calculated marketing that the word is </v>
<v Speaker 2>anathema to your brand.</v>

704
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

705
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the big issues in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote hunting community about a </v>

706
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.010
<v Speaker 3>lot of these girls that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

707
00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:14.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hunting like you don't know.</v>

708
00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:16.800
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to explain it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

709
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.000
<v Speaker 3>there's this whole movement where these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty girls have,</v>

710
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some of them are.</v>

711
00:32:21.741 --> 00:32:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean for sure some of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic.</v>

712
00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to discredit the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are authentic,</v>

713
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.090
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them</v>

714
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.490
<v Speaker 2>are essentially using social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want to understand the,</v>

715
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.280
<v Speaker 2>and this is maybe a generalization about</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women,</v>

716
00:32:36.281 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>but do you think women have the</v>

717
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 1>DNA and the true reward system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they getting dopamine from hunt?</v>

718
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Are they inherit hunters the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>women like playing sports,</v>

719
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 1>they would love hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

720
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same way people like very </v>

721
00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:57.910
<v Speaker 1>challenging and difficult things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer you.</v>

722
00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>A massive reward will not do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sports is.</v>

723
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>There's teamwork which is a gives us </v>
<v Speaker 1>dopamine and adrenaline,</v>

724
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:09.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm sort of interested in women </v>

725
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.041
<v Speaker 1>in general that do things like make out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other guys when they're not </v>

726
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 1>lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to get another guy's attention.</v>

727
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

728
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:15.970
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

729
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Make up with other girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make out with other girls.</v>

730
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Like are women hunting because they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to or because it's they feel socially.</v>

731
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I think there's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think we would obviously we'd </v>

732
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.080
<v Speaker 1>make a massive generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women do this because I hate that shit.</v>

733
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I hate when people say the left does </v>
<v Speaker 1>this or the right.</v>

734
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She gets goofy.</v>

735
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never met someone that does it,</v>

736
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:39.610
<v Speaker 1>so I have no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

737
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of women that do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and some of them are unquestionably</v>

738
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:48.791
<v Speaker 1>authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them are unquestionably </v>

739
00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:51.250
<v Speaker 1>targeting social media and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific avenues of getting famous and </v>

740
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 1>making a living and inside the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

741
00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a very hotly debated subject about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like whether or not some of these women </v>

742
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>are legit and who is legit and who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

743
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 1>what if their knowledge it does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter or no,</v>

744
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it different than a girl grows a </v>

745
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 1>fitness freak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

746
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.430
<v Speaker 1>A girl just likes doing squats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're designed to keep.</v>

747
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.120
<v Speaker 1>If we get attention for something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain just keeps doing it.</v>

748
00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 1>There was a vice thing about that today </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I retweeted a thirsty pictures.</v>

749
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to answer girls.</v>

750
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Girls like with bras on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

751
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:26.290
<v Speaker 1>why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do they.</v>

752
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Because they're getting likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

753
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Why do they have their ass hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a thong with the legs,</v>

754
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.700
<v Speaker 1>like sort of exposed in bed where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretending that they're sleeping</v>

755
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.880
<v Speaker 1>and millions of people looking at them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we like it,</v>

756
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

757
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean what got us attention is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to keep doing.</v>

758
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:48.551
<v Speaker 1>Who is the perpetrator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the person doing it or the </v>

760
00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 1>person enabling it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

761
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to stop because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like looking at those pictures.</v>

762
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you follow that on instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I follow a lot of hoes.</v>

763
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that do for you?</v>

764
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I follow a lot of dummies.</v>

765
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Two PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to like I pm just </v>

766
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:08.080
<v Speaker 1>specifically right after lunch and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like blood holes after lunch and you </v>

767
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.680
<v Speaker 1>know there's not any buttholes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>

768
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Instagram is all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be like pg cocktail yet.</v>

769
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 1>But is that distracting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

770
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:20.291
<v Speaker 1>It's because I'm fascinated by what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in our brain and the sort of way of </v>

771
00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:24.580
<v Speaker 1>wires our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that just sort of make you </v>

772
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:24.580
<v Speaker 1>exacerbate the obsession with sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

773
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.960
<v Speaker 1>let me go over my thing right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for me I follow I think more </v>

774
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>than a thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

775
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 1>so this is not curated fall 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>224 people.</v>

776
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I try to do with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram</v>

777
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 3>feed is have it be a cascade of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

778
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I follow people who are animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>activists and vegans.</v>

779
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:47.130
<v Speaker 3>You want to know people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders.</v>

780
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I've followed people who are fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fall.</v>

781
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.810
<v Speaker 3>If you looked at like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

782
00:35:50.811 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you do the search and the algorithm </v>
<v Speaker 3>tries to find out like why you are.</v>

783
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck I am.</v>

784
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:02.390
<v Speaker 3>There's flowers and dead deer and guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting head kicked and muscle cars and </v>

785
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.530
<v Speaker 3>it looks like I'm a fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

786
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 3>which I probably am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I do is I tried to.</v>

787
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 3>If you have anything remotely </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>

788
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I just follow you and then I unfollow </v>
<v Speaker 3>people all the time too.</v>

789
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:18.110
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting about you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to me illustrates an absence of </v>

790
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 2>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're very.</v>

791
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm open to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know how everybody thinks</v>

792
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.800
<v Speaker 2>and that's so cool because I definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an ego,</v>

793
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:28.900
<v Speaker 2>but I beat the fuck out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

794
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

795
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you know more than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find that I get very threatened by</v>

797
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 2>things that I didn't upset me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just saw that,</v>

798
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:39.520
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is going to be,</v>

799
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 2>my whole day is going to be dedicated to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like obsessing about,</v>

800
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

801
00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:48.471
<v Speaker 2>so I think I'm doing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of under the guise of self </v>

802
00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:50.280
<v Speaker 2>protection or boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I actually ended up robbing myself a</v>

803
00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Speaker 2>little bit by like I went through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery page and there's photos that I</v>

804
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 2>don't want to see because I do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog rescue.</v>

805
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:01.790
<v Speaker 2>And then you ended up getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like seeing head ahead of dogs and the </v>

806
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Chinese dogs and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see it.</v>

807
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:07.390
<v Speaker 2>The dog festival too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hypervigilant and I'm just to like,</v>

808
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

809
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma survivors.</v>

810
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.970
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the same ability to calm </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves down.</v>

811
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it just will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the aftermath is just too much for </v>

812
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:17.340
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went in and I,</v>

813
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 2>on the discovery page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can put see less photos like this.</v>

814
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>So I'm now narrowing my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

815
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.420
<v Speaker 2>sort of as my new puppy named Marshall </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marshall.</v>

816
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 2>He's a golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best.</v>

817
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.240
<v Speaker 2>He's the sweetest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best security system you will ever have.</v>

818
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.510
<v Speaker 2>The Sky for dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for bark.</v>

819
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Just having to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

820
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I had a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone breaking in my house.</v>

821
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Is that your first dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

822
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.240
<v Speaker 2>this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a ton of dogs.</v>

823
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know so much about you,</v>

824
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:51.850
<v Speaker 2>but I know nothing.</v>

825
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.560
<v Speaker 2>But I had this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

826
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 2>the security guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

827
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 2>come to my house and he said the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>security system is putting chimes on all</v>

828
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 2>of your door knobs because people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>break in,</v>

829
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.660
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.670
<v Speaker 2>they expect an alarm and then they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like three minutes or </v>

831
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.670
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they open a door knob and there's</v>

832
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.160
<v Speaker 2>some dream catcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

833
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 2>making a bunch of noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they freak out.</v>

834
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

835
00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 2>And then a dog dogs are good and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got big dogs,</v>

836
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 2>pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

837
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a good move for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:23.730
<v Speaker 2>They've taught me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

839
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:28.310
<v Speaker 2>for me it's like the thing with me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not as sort of mental Adam,</v>

840
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.320
<v Speaker 2>the same like functional mental acumen </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a and all the work that I </v>

841
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 2>do to try to rewire my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to practice,</v>

842
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the problem,</v>

843
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to practice,</v>

844
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.800
<v Speaker 2>without something where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramifications aren't going to be huge </v>

846
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:46.800
<v Speaker 2>like practicing on people.</v>

847
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 2>if people are so triggering that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to get out of the fight or flight a</v>

849
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.540
<v Speaker 2>sort of fear mindset if you're with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very kind of person that triggers you.</v>

850
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 2>So animals are a great way for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on the things that I'm working on.</v>

851
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 2>How do people trigger you won't way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

852
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I have sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of how I grew up,</v>

853
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:10.621
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a alcoholic home and anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has an authority sort of Vibe,</v>

854
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain and we all I think tend to kind</v>

855
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 2>of do this if we're not like checking </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in our,</v>

856
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 2>in our conscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We recreate our childhood circumstances.</v>

857
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:25.861
<v Speaker 2>So I sometimes I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to make sure I don't go </v>

858
00:39:25.861 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 2>through my life where everybody's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>projection of what happened to me.</v>

859
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Just sort of being in this moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of this network executives,</v>

860
00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:34.360
<v Speaker 2>my dad and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.660
<v Speaker 2>the guy that runs this comedy club is my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

862
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:39.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of have my,</v>

863
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:44.570
<v Speaker 2>our brains go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what this is and then we start </v>

864
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:44.570
<v Speaker 2>doing her old behaviors are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

865
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of um,</v>

866
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection mechanisms that we developed.</v>

867
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 2>And horses are actually helping me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most with it.</v>

868
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 2>But dogs help too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

869
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 3>For me it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really happen anymore.</v>

870
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:03.121
<v Speaker 3>But when I was younger and places and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I knew when I was a loser </v>

871
00:40:03.121 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 3>would make me feel like I was a loser.</v>

872
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

873
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.450
<v Speaker 2>you're just time travel back and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden you're eight years old.</v>

874
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm still a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get away from you.</v>

875
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I made it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

876
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>

877
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.840
<v Speaker 2>And I'm working on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of advantages to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being hypersensitive.</v>

879
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably what we're good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

880
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 2>what we do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make observations.</v>

881
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 2>We have to be sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We comedians,</v>

882
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:21.610
<v Speaker 2>the idea is to see things that no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>else sees.</v>

883
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find myself struggling a lot as I,</v>

884
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:31.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what I do for a living when I deal </v>

885
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.020
<v Speaker 2>with ostensible authority figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreating my childhood circumstances.</v>

886
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:37.021
<v Speaker 2>And I also had an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in your opinion or view </v>

887
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:38.990
<v Speaker 2>on this as a dre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

888
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I have a very real addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline and it doesn't manifest in </v>

889
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.590
<v Speaker 2>mma or the kind of adrenaline that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced and see.</v>

890
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 2>But I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epigenetic imprinting like,</v>

891
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:53.920
<v Speaker 2>which is when in the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom has a lot of stress,</v>

892
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.170
<v Speaker 2>cortisol and adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The baby gets addicted to it,</v>

893
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.650
<v Speaker 2>so just like crack or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can be addicted to neurochemicals.</v>

894
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.820
<v Speaker 2>So from a very early age I had a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>high tolerance for adrenaline and I find</v>

895
00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 2>myself or found myself not so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

896
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:11.600
<v Speaker 2>like in these just really traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations that um,</v>

897
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 2>so that I get because adrenaline turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>into dopamine.</v>

898
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

899
00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.220
<v Speaker 3>how do we prove that that's what happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the child?</v>

900
00:41:17.221 --> 00:41:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Because I would just assume that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of it would just be genetic and</v>

901
00:41:21.451 --> 00:41:26.451
<v Speaker 3>how much of it would be circumstantial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do you prove that while this </v>

902
00:41:26.451 --> 00:41:28.200
<v Speaker 3>woman's been under stress in the womb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think you would have to.</v>

903
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.800
<v Speaker 3>One thing you realize when you do have </v>
<v Speaker 3>children is that every kid is different.</v>

904
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

905
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:38.190
<v Speaker 2>tonight we are going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably different because the </v>

906
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.190
<v Speaker 2>first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mom is probably like,</v>

907
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I've never done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second one,</v>

908
00:41:39.371 --> 00:41:40.420
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this,</v>

909
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the third one that you know,</v>

910
00:41:42.071 --> 00:41:43.900
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hardly.</v>

911
00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:48.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and the MCT oil mct and knock it </v>

912
00:41:48.901 --> 00:41:50.620
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lube up the box and push it out,</v>

913
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.400
<v Speaker 2>give it a slap,</v>

914
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:58.990
<v Speaker 3>send it on way data the year Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>hashtags about the posts.</v>

915
00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

916
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's most certainly got to be some </v>

917
00:42:10.171 --> 00:42:15.171
<v Speaker 3>way that nature prepares the human for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the circumstances it's going to face as </v>

918
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:15.171
<v Speaker 3>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

919
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Michael Irvin was the first one to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain this to me.</v>

920
00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:17.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the football player.</v>

921
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.430
<v Speaker 3>He and he and I were on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to stay away from football.</v>

922
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 3>He's a super nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

923
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.400
<v Speaker 3>he and I were on a flight once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just randomly to Australia.</v>

924
00:42:26.401 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those crazy 14 hour flights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

925
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 3>and we talked for a long time about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's a big UFC fan and we just </v>

926
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.521
<v Speaker 3>started talking about people that grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in bad neighborhoods and children </v>

927
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:41.190
<v Speaker 3>that grow up in abusive households that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you developed this penchant for violence</v>

928
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.880
<v Speaker 3>like very early on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an addiction to violence and,</v>

929
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 3>and then also he was saying that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>trigger is so much the like their wic </v>

930
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fuse is so much shorter person.</v>

931
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like you have to be easily </v>

932
00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.470
<v Speaker 3>wiped away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be prepared to go crazy.</v>

933
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Whereas someone who grows up in a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy healthy environment where moms on </v>

934
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's fine,</v>

935
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then then you like,</v>

936
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 3>you can't get going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

937
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:12.701
<v Speaker 3>so I wonder what's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it better to be hypersensitive and </v>

938
00:43:12.701 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 3>hyper fueled and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and always ready to sprint and then </v>

939
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.751
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to calm yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it better to be just some dough </v>

940
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:23.790
<v Speaker 3>ball with no instincts at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has to toughen up.</v>

941
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the answer is probably </v>

942
00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in between and the ideas to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to react to the circumstances.</v>

943
00:43:30.431 --> 00:43:33.940
<v Speaker 2>You're in an inappropriate way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're in a dangerous situation to</v>

944
00:43:33.941 --> 00:43:36.970
<v Speaker 2>be able to go zero to 60 and defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

945
00:43:36.971 --> 00:43:41.971
<v Speaker 2>but if you're not in a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation to know that and to stop </v>

946
00:43:41.971 --> 00:43:42.730
<v Speaker 2>shadow boxing in a safe situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

947
00:43:42.731 --> 00:43:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I found myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a dangerous situation.</v>

948
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I was always at war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war was over and I continued to </v>

949
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.241
<v Speaker 2>fight a war that wasn't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those guys that was in </v>

950
00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:55.120
<v Speaker 2>world war two and they find them on some</v>
<v Speaker 2>island outside of that.</v>

951
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war's over covered in armor.</v>

952
00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>

953
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.390
<v Speaker 3>this guy that was on an island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on an island.</v>

954
00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:05.580
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know the war was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a Japanese guy.</v>

955
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know the war was over for 30 </v>

956
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will.</v>

957
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:11.730
<v Speaker 3>He was literally Tom Hanks in it on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>island.</v>

958
00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unbelievable.</v>

959
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how.</v>

960
00:44:15.601 --> 00:44:20.601
<v Speaker 2>That's how a lot of people that grew up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in dysfunctional home sort of live and </v>

961
00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm done taking it out on employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>employers,</v>

962
00:44:22.591 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend's friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair to them.</v>

963
00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:30.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things I heard in the </v>

964
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:31.320
<v Speaker 2>12 step program I'm in is this guy said </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was leading the meeting.</v>

965
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war is over.</v>

966
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 2>You lost.</v>

967
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.960
<v Speaker 2>This is so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

968
00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:43.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like time to put the weapons down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and start living a.</v>

969
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.620
<v Speaker 2>it's really just being appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you and I,</v>

970
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in a relationship and you're like,</v>

971
00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:52.841
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to step out and go do my podcast </v>

972
00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:52.841
<v Speaker 2>and I start feeling abandoned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>

973
00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:54.550
<v Speaker 2>That has nothing to do with you that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

974
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.520
<v Speaker 2>that gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair to you or relationships or</v>

975
00:44:58.521 --> 00:45:03.521
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm going to react to the </v>

976
00:45:03.521 --> 00:45:03.521
<v Speaker 2>present moment instead of what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me 20 years ago.</v>

977
00:45:03.521 --> 00:45:07.601
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a puppet of like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents failures and I'm just trying to </v>

978
00:45:07.601 --> 00:45:11.201
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are situations where you might </v>

979
00:45:11.201 --> 00:45:11.570
<v Speaker 2>have to go zero to 60 and fight for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

980
00:45:11.571 --> 00:45:14.510
<v Speaker 2>But knowing when those situations are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually happening in when they're not.</v>

981
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's better to be able to go</v>

982
00:45:17.831 --> 00:45:20.290
<v Speaker 3>zero to 60 really quick and just manage </v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

983
00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.640
<v Speaker 2>and I know I can do that like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

984
00:45:22.641 --> 00:45:26.390
<v Speaker 2>But in a conference room with three </v>
<v Speaker 2>executives is,</v>

985
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not the time my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my mind,</v>

986
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:35.650
<v Speaker 3>it's never the time to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference room with three executives </v>

987
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:35.650
<v Speaker 3>when I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

988
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:35.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get out of here.</v>

989
00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all fake</v>

990
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>

991
00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:39.630
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that like?</v>

992
00:45:39.631 --> 00:45:44.631
<v Speaker 2>Is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that because you're not getting </v>

993
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:44.631
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

994
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared to ever be them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared to ever been locked into some</v>

995
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 3>cubicle existence on a conscious level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never will be.</v>

996
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 3>I know on a conscious level I'll never </v>
<v Speaker 3>be there.</v>

997
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:54.921
<v Speaker 3>But I know that rational fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm around people that are dying of </v>

998
00:45:54.921 --> 00:45:54.921
<v Speaker 3>syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're right there,</v>

999
00:45:54.921 --> 00:45:54.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1000
00:45:54.921 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're rotting away.</v>

1001
00:45:55.591 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 3>They've got some ebola or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got some.</v>

1002
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 3>So what in our field that's just called </v>
<v Speaker 3>a law school degree.</v>

1003
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy that used to live next </v>

1004
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:09.280
<v Speaker 3>door to me and I just call them bling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bling,</v>

1005
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.400
<v Speaker 3>bling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bling,</v>

1006
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 3>bling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bling would do,</v>

1007
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:14.850
<v Speaker 3>is talk about stuff that's all he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever talk about.</v>

1008
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:19.851
<v Speaker 3>Like all this guy would do is talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>objects and new cars and new things in </v>

1009
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.050
<v Speaker 3>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1010
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was retarded.</v>

1011
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 3>It's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's boring.</v>

1012
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lack of adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1013
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 3>I knew that he was trapped and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>was working.</v>

1014
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I think he was an attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what he did,</v>

1015
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.620
<v Speaker 3>but he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1016
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.850
<v Speaker 3>all he was doing was working towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>

1017
00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 3>getting new objects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a nice house.</v>

1018
00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:39.850
<v Speaker 3>He had a nice car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's always wanted to talk about </v>

1019
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.021
<v Speaker 3>cars and objects is done a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you left his wife and then she got </v>

1020
00:46:42.021 --> 00:46:42.021
<v Speaker 3>real crazy.</v>

1021
00:46:42.021 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to get internal needs met </v>

1022
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 2>with external things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also probably trying to bond with</v>

1023
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.590
<v Speaker 2>you and he thought that was how.</v>

1024
00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that probably makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was probably just like cars hitting </v>

1025
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:52.860
<v Speaker 3>yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me,</v>

1026
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:52.860
<v Speaker 3>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me.</v>

1027
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh that is a depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is Jewish,</v>

1028
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.970
<v Speaker 3>he's single,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sounds like he's got a gut,</v>

1029
00:47:00.971 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 3>but whatever you fix her up or give them</v>

<v Speaker 3>from the night and get some of that mct </v>

<v Speaker 3>oil and he'll shit his belly out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember phen phen?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1043
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.410

<v Speaker 3>but I want you to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was on adderall.</v>

1069
00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>told you need to be on adderall.</v>

1070
00:48:49.441 --> 00:48:53.160

<v Speaker 3>You are on amphetamines.</v>

1071
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.010
<v Speaker 3>You are on spew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Get it twisted.</v>

1072
00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Don't get it twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1073
00:48:57.571 --> 00:49:00.120
<v Speaker 3>if you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're taking it every day</v>

1074
00:49:00.121 --> 00:49:05.121
<v Speaker 3>or three or four times a week and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to develop a tolerance to it </v>

1075
00:49:05.121 --> 00:49:05.640
<v Speaker 3>and then it just becomes an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're on speed folks.</v>

1076
00:49:05.641 --> 00:49:07.200
<v Speaker 3>And you might be okay with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1077
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to a guy just scored a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of mct oil and some coffee and</v>

1078
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.710
<v Speaker 2>actually occurring coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1079
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:13.460
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1080
00:49:13.461 --> 00:49:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have addiction in my dna if you know,</v>

1081
00:49:16.701 --> 00:49:19.070
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would just explore that.</v>

1082
00:49:19.071 --> 00:49:20.210
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1083
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to look at not the things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can add,</v>

1084
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.270
<v Speaker 2>but the things I can subtract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of taking adderall,</v>

1085
00:49:26.271 --> 00:49:29.140
<v Speaker 2>why don't I just stop eating sugar?</v>

1086
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened.</v>

1087
00:49:29.811 --> 00:49:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's some beneficial aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>adderall to some people.</v>

1088
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you got to understand,</v>

1089
00:49:37.311 --> 00:49:39.840
<v Speaker 3>I know so many moms that are on fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>adults,</v>

1090
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 3>shocking dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so many of them and they're around </v>

1091
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 3>you and they're all like pepe.</v>

1092
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.350
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating to me because the people I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know who take the money can't stop </v>

1093
00:49:50.611 --> 00:49:50.970
<v Speaker 4>moving.</v>

1094
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Complaining about anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

1095
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of fascinated by because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's kind of like,</v>

1096
00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival of the fittest.</v>

1097
00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:03.821
<v Speaker 2>We are the fittest and the most anxious </v>
<v Speaker 2>one because the most anxious people and </v>

1098
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:06.450
<v Speaker 2>tribes were the ones that survived </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they knew lions were,</v>

1099
00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1100
00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 3>I had to explain that to my daughter </v>
<v Speaker 3>because my daughter was worried about </v>

1101
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:12.740
<v Speaker 3>some things and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was asking me some questions and she</v>

1102
00:50:12.741 --> 00:50:17.741
<v Speaker 3>was worried about stuff and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know why you're worried about </v>

1103
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:17.741
<v Speaker 3>these things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

1104
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:21.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because you're smart and you're </v>

1105
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:21.750
<v Speaker 3>aware of danger and you're aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables.</v>

1106
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be fun.</v>

1107
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like that too.</v>

1108
00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>But I've just figured out how to manage </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and so I to like kind of explain</v>

1109
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.910
<v Speaker 1>it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1110
00:50:28.911 --> 00:50:31.140
<v Speaker 1>you're just a smart little girl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1111
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 1>you're aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1112
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:37.241
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fucking idiots out </v>

1113
00:50:37.241 --> 00:50:37.241
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are on there.</v>

1114
00:50:37.241 --> 00:50:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Like she freaks out when she sees people</v>
<v Speaker 1>texting and driving was like,</v>

1115
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.490
<v Speaker 1>dad's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

1116
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.800
<v Speaker 1>he's not looking at his car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kills more people than drunk </v>

1117
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:44.800
<v Speaker 1>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she's right to be,</v>

1118
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just being anxious about that </v>

1119
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.930
<v Speaker 1>instead of something you can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the brain starts going,</v>

1120
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's age is because like,</v>

1121
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:56.381
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you stop people from doing that </v>

1122
00:50:56.381 --> 00:50:56.381
<v Speaker 1>liquid if they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what if they hit her car?</v>

1123
00:50:56.381 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 1>What if they hit somebody else's car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

1124
00:50:57.651 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Then her and I are the same person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes adrenaline which makes </v>

1126
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.201
<v Speaker 1>dopamine and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of becomes this outflowing </v>

1127
00:51:08.201 --> 00:51:08.201
<v Speaker 1>prophecy.</v>

1128
00:51:08.201 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Our brains evolved to make anxiety feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>good on some level.</v>

1129
00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It makes us crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women that are the moms that she goes to</v>

1130
00:51:13.671 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 1>school with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her kids go to school with her friends,</v>

1131
00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Speaker 1>whether they're moms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on fucking xanax too,</v>

1132
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.560
<v Speaker 1>so they're on Xanax and they're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>

1133
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.860
<v Speaker 1>So delete both and you're at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1134
00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but they want to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way to do it.</v>

1135
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:32.140
<v Speaker 1>This is the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay happy to be on Xanax because from </v>

1136
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:38.440
<v Speaker 1>being scared and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then and then keeps you guys.</v>

1137
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:45.850
<v Speaker 1>If you can afford time wise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially to go to the appointment to </v>

1138
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 1>get xanax and adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no actual problem.</v>

1139
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:49.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1140
00:51:49.281 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing is they all want to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>

1141
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 1>They go to doctors constantly sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you.</v>

1142
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:59.500
<v Speaker 1>You get this idea in your head that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find this guy and he's </v>

1143
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.041
<v Speaker 1>got a good job and you're going to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a nice community and you're going to </v>

1144

<v Speaker 1>have children and then you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be happy.</v>

1145
00:52:03.041 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 1>My nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize like,</v>

1146
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:09.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're just breeding and then you </v>

1147
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 1>know you have to find fulfillment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actual existence.</v>

1148
00:52:09.231 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Your Day to day here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment like this,</v>

1149
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now,</v>

1150
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 1>you have to find fulfillment in that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be in like bling </v>

1151
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 1>blings idea where you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1152
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:24.101
<v Speaker 1>I got a boat now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up my boat and now I've got to </v>

1153
00:52:24.101 --> 00:52:24.101
<v Speaker 1>fucking this and I'm going to look at my</v>
<v Speaker 1>new watch.</v>

1154
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1155
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And You keep trying to fill that hole up</v>

1156
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:28.460
<v Speaker 1>and it never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never gets filled.</v>

1157
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these women start going to dog,</v>

1158
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I've got anxiety and the doctor like </v>
<v Speaker 1>here take this is like opposable thumbs.</v>

1159
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:40.790
<v Speaker 1>It's been very effective and useful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our history.</v>

1160
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is the first time in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>history that anxiety is not particularly</v>

1161
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:48.590
<v Speaker 1>useful because we have doors and locks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know.</v>

1162
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1163
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting tie here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entitlement.</v>

1164
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:54.770
<v Speaker 1>When I hear about that and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely been like,</v>

1165
00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a show and I have to write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>script and I'm going to take it.</v>

1166
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely cheated and cut corners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1167
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not cheating and cut corners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just mean when I'm like,</v>

1168
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I have to finish the script in four </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

1169
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a half an adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely done it,</v>

1170
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but I know I have addiction in my dna </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that can get real ugly.</v>

1171
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never done adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it really?</v>

1172
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's different with everybody.</v>

1173
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.590
<v Speaker 1>My experience with adult adderall is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm,</v>

1174
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.520
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1175
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:26.290
<v Speaker 1>not easily distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when people diagnosed </v>

1176
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:26.290
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have add,</v>

1177
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I have OCD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you had any</v>

1178
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:28.870
<v Speaker 2>of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to sit on a podcast</v>

1179
00:53:28.871 --> 00:53:31.800
<v Speaker 2>for an hour and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that in a minute,</v>

1180
00:53:31.801 --> 00:53:32.570
<v Speaker 2>but go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please go.</v>

1181
00:53:32.571 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I just what it does for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1182
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:39.651
<v Speaker 2>it could be a placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of these things that we take </v>

1183
00:53:39.651 --> 00:53:39.651
<v Speaker 2>maybe with the exception of </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines,</v>

1184
00:53:39.651 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 2>but certainly antidepressants and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>is taking it,</v>

1185
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 2>is part of why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the act of putting it in your mouth</v>

1186
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 2>and swallowing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think placebo effect is something like</v>

1187
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:53.271
<v Speaker 2>58 percent or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct me on that because I'm probably </v>

1188
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:53.271
<v Speaker 2>wrong please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1189
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:54.240
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>

1190
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I find if I'm at my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because all these devices are all </v>

1191
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.730
<v Speaker 2>addictive to the color of the cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline.</v>

1192
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 2>So if I've got this device in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1193
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I've got my computer and I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>

1194
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:07.881
<v Speaker 2>writing and this dings and I'm here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm an instagram and then there's </v>

1195
00:54:07.881 --> 00:54:08.620
<v Speaker 2>the link and then all of a sudden I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading about the apocalypse and I,</v>

1196
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:10.560
<v Speaker 2>my email might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1197
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:13.870
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm in a fucking email thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it's totally a net.</v>

1198
00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Haha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like love you too.</v>

1199
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:16.590
<v Speaker 2>See you soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See you soon.</v>

1200
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:18.540
<v Speaker 2>And then I just can't end of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange.</v>

1201
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And basically when I've taken adderall </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past I just do one thing with </v>

1202
00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 2>more enthusiasm and it is less appealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me to go do other things.</v>

1203
00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.620
<v Speaker 1>The other day I put my phone down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>workout.</v>

1204
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I worked out for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got done.</v>

1205
00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:36.311
<v Speaker 1>I had 37 texts to too many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were probably all from me and </v>

1206
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Krista.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leah.</v>

1207
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.780
<v Speaker 1>There is one thing that we can't talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much about this,</v>

1208
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but one thread you realize that we also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have our own thread without you.</v>

1209
00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:50.390
<v Speaker 1>When we worry we're bothering you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max.</v>

1210
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Even all of our exchanges all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'll respond,</v>

1211
00:54:56.301 --> 00:54:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but then you won't respond for like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1212
00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh he's too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a family we can't.</v>

1213
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Like if his wife sees that he has 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed tax mistakes at midnight,</v>

1214
00:55:06.801 --> 00:55:09.720
<v Speaker 1>like this is bad for his daughter asks </v>
<v Speaker 1>me sometimes.</v>

1215
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we're watching TV and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1216
00:55:11.601 --> 00:55:12.850
<v Speaker 1>who's texting you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1217
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian,</v>

1218
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:16.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did Whitney just said you 40 tax?</v>

1219
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well she also sent into two other guys.</v>

1220
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:20.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's ruining everyone's relationship.</v>

1221
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:21.890
<v Speaker 1>A jealousy issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a.</v>

1222
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a family.</v>

1223
00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:26.420
<v Speaker 1>This is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not wrong.</v>

1224
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.310
<v Speaker 2>So there's something interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of being on your phone with kids is</v>

1225
00:55:30.311 --> 00:55:33.910
<v Speaker 2>the new being drunk on your phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>because kids look at you and they think,</v>

1226
00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that device is more important than me.</v>

1227
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I must be a real piece of shit if daddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>would rather look at that or mommy or </v>

1228
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.450
<v Speaker 2>There's an interesting that like cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone uses the new alcoholism.</v>

1230
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my little kid got ahold of snapchat </v>

1231
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.731
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's been doing these snapchat videos </v>

1232
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:52.960
<v Speaker 1>are fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's my six year old is hilarious.</v>

1233
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.620
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She uses the filter so you don't.</v>

1234
00:55:55.630 --> 00:56:00.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't see it's her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was Abraham Lincoln yesterday </v>

1235
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and then she became an evil snowball </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's a little fuck.</v>

1236
00:56:01.731 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she doesn't post that.</v>

1237
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1238
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just leaves him on my phone.</v>

1239
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Then I sometimes I put them up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram because they're so ridiculous.</v>

1240
00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Just yesterday I started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that's a slippery slope </v>

1241
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.590
<v Speaker 1>because they get addicted to those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little things and it all makes,</v>

1242
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline.</v>

1243
00:56:18.551 --> 00:56:23.551
<v Speaker 1>So going back to what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're cheating because </v>

1244
00:56:23.551 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you take a half an adderall to work on</v>

1245
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.040
<v Speaker 2>a script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no different than me drinking </v>

1246
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.150
<v Speaker 2>coffee or smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoked a lot of pot.</v>

1247
00:56:29.151 --> 00:56:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I,</v>

1248
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 2>if I smoke pot and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1249
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Did I cheat too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1250
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1251
00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you said this or like knowing who</v>

1252
00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 2>you are and what your limitations are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what actually works for you and what</v>

1253
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 2>starts being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 2>diminished showed diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know if I smoke pot every night,</v>

1255
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be as effective for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to be groggy.</v>

1256
00:56:48.101 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1257
00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I have some restraint about it and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

1258
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Not on New Year's eve that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1259
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:55.480
<v Speaker 2>She sent me a picture for New Year's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eve.</v>

1260
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.280
<v Speaker 2>She looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look like someone sprayed you with a</v>

1261
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 2>mist of sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

1262
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had a and I'll tell you about this </v>

1263
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.940
<v Speaker 2>next time I come on because I am writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it in a book and I and I,</v>

1264
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:13.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a long story but I had a surgery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't do well on painkillers by </v>

1265
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.000
<v Speaker 2>some miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1266
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:19.170
<v Speaker 2>because my genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family loves me killers but I for </v>

1267
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 2>some reason they make me really nauseous</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1268
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:25.890
<v Speaker 2>and I was smoking weed instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was also like,</v>

1269
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your take on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my lungs were.</v>

1270
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I was like getting out of breath and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1271
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:31.950
<v Speaker 2>let me just do these edible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1272
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Because I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in like a spin class or something,</v>

1273
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:39.751
<v Speaker 2>which sometimes I do just for like anger</v>
<v Speaker 2>management and you fucking cracking your</v>

1274
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 2>enamel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just slamming my vagina being just </v>

1275
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 2>totally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard on the,</v>

1276
00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 2>on the lady bits that spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it too much.</v>

1277
00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 2>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slam it back.</v>

1278
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard seat and you're slamming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping it back.</v>

1279
00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:06.511
<v Speaker 2>But there is this one class that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really liked and I liked the instructor </v>

1280
00:58:06.511 --> 00:58:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and I just kind of cry and release anger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and it's painful and I'm.</v>

1281
00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your sweater?</v>

1282
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:11.170
<v Speaker 2>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get away with a cry here.</v>

1283
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's like it's yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's something about,</v>

1284
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 2>for me when I feel a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain,</v>

1285
00:58:16.121 --> 00:58:21.121
<v Speaker 2>it just like opens up some kind of well </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sadness that if it didn't,</v>

1286
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.400
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't cry it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come out as anger another </v>

1287
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.611
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd rather just release it in a </v>

1288
00:58:29.611 --> 00:58:29.611
<v Speaker 2>healthy private way and pay $38 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

1289
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It's $30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks a class.</v>

1290
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:36.031
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think soul cycle is like 38 bucks if </v>

1291
00:58:36.031 --> 00:58:36.031
<v Speaker 2>you do it one at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do it,</v>

1292
00:58:36.031 --> 00:58:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I do it in a package so it's less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems super expensive.</v>

1293
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1294
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of like rich publicists a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending that a problem.</v>

1295
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I was in aspen and it was during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter and they opened up the school.</v>

1296
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I was at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1297
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:51.700
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1298
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not throckmorton theatre that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1299
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:59.630
<v Speaker 2>that's where I stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they have a festival there again </v>

1300
00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:01.560
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1301
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 2>it was me and Neilan and Margaret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the first year.</v>

1302
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the theme?</v>

1303
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Nights I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sick the entire time.</v>

1304
00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Hard with that at oxygen up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 8,000</v>

1305
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 2>feet above sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in town I can't,</v>

1306
00:59:17.531 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 2>it can't be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1307
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it is eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

1308
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 2>not initially,</v>

1309
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was my point?</v>

1310
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:30.250
<v Speaker 1>You were in Aspen and we span and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

1311
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't spend shape I've ever been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when I was in aspen for like a week </v>

1312
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and I worked out everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1313
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.291
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why fighters go up to big </v>

1314
00:59:41.291 --> 00:59:41.291
<v Speaker 1>bear and train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1315
00:59:41.291 --> 00:59:43.010
<v Speaker 1>And like a steamboat springs maybe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

1316
00:59:43.011 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's above in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all do a denver.</v>

1317
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a team elevate that competes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1318
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it twice as much like you,</v>

1319
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.320
<v Speaker 1>like if you work out 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that equal the 40 minutes?</v>

1320
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Basically tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1321
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the way they think you're supposed to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it now,</v>

1322
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>they think you're supposed to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>train at sea level and then sleep </v>

1323
01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you could live at the base of big </v>

1324
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>bear and then drive up to big bear to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your workouts in and then drive down</v>

1325
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>to live and sleep because the idea is.</v>

1326
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Or The opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1327
01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:17.771
<v Speaker 1>drive down and get your workouts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive back up to live in because they </v>

1328
01:00:17.771 --> 01:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>think that you get more workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put in sea level and then when you're </v>

1329
01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>not going to tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1330
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>But then your body recovers and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>acclimate to having a higher threshold.</v>

1331
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>You develop more red blood cells the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole deal.</v>

1332
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a spin classes up there soul </v>

1333
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>cycle and they only opened it up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a month.</v>

1334
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1335
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>they just rented a place for a month for</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul cycle during peak ski season.</v>

1336
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1337
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1338
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>what is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The historic just opens for a month,</v>

1339
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>like a pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how they do those </v>

1340
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>halloween stores when a place closes </v>
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>

1341
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1342
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like a Christmas tree,</v>

1343
01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>they just brought in a bunch of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycles and set up a social.</v>

1344
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might've been doing it to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>test the waters whether or not because </v>

1345
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>aspen is so much fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

1346
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Every other car has a range rover and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked.</v>

1347
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>It's really just rich alcoholics losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in minks drinking makers to pen.</v>

1348
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked because my flight got </v>

1349
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>canceled and I had to stay for the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was a high end hooker,</v>

1350
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>that's where I went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a pop up.</v>

1351
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's use spin an 8,000</v>

1352
01:01:20.121 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knows that what it is.</v>

1353
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>They call it a pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

1354
01:01:22.391 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1355
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1356
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know your take on spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My chiropractor says he is going to </v>

1357
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>retire on the money that he gets from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning injuries.</v>

1358
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>He's literally like people doing yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spinning a how I pay my bills.</v>

1359
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of people do it not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>improperly and mess up their shoulders </v>

1360
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>real bad and their lower backs doing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those downward dog.</v>

1361
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>If you mess up your shoulders from Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump off a fucking building.</v>

1362
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Seriously you pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what takes you out.</v>

1363
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>How'd you break a snow dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing Yoga got daily snowboarding.</v>

1364
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1365
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>it's more like people want to do yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>for exercise,</v>

1366
01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>like these type A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want yoga to burn 9,000</v>

1367
01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:08.501
<v Speaker 1>calories and get them like a huge ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really what yoga is </v>

1368
01:02:08.501 --> 01:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>designed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's all these new yoga classes </v>

1369
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that are like acro yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot intense,</v>

1370
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>and you're too loose and you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do things that well.</v>

1371
01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no like pushups in weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

1372
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>We were on one shoulder and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that kind of deal that you're</v>

1373
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:24.891
<v Speaker 1>doing it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to injure yourself unless </v>

1374
01:02:24.891 --> 01:02:24.891
<v Speaker 1>you have a one on one instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do be crumbs.</v>

1375
01:02:24.891 --> 01:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Hot Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching,</v>

1376
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My spine particular spine strengthening.</v>

1377
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't go to yoga to get glutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1378
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>You do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to balance even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1380
01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1381
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you gotta be real careful with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those common atory type movements.</v>

1382
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me soul site or like spinning is </v>

1383
01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>really just to like get out anger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like push myself.</v>

1384
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Even crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think crossfit can be very dangerous </v>

1385
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:59.481
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of people that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfit and they don't really have </v>

1386
01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>perfect technique and they do it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure and you know,</v>

1387
01:03:00.411 --> 01:03:05.411
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing these incredibly high </v>

1388
01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 1>repetitions of power moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Steve Maxwell,</v>

1389
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 1>who's a real world famous strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning coach,</v>

1390
01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1391
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.360
<v Speaker 1>he's power moves like cleans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presses.</v>

1392
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to do low repetition for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that is supposed to generate </v>

1393
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 1>extremes for even lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pavel Tatsu,</v>

1394
01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Ilene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the,</v>

1395
01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:25.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the godfather of kettlebells and </v>

1396
01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:25.441
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we brought them over from Russia.</v>

1397
01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>He believes you shouldn't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than five repetitions.</v>

1398
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>And what you do is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this like,</v>

1399
01:03:29.281 --> 01:03:31.890
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfit attracts such a type,</v>

1400
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 1>a overachiever type of person that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1401
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:41.370
<v Speaker 1>a desire for overachieving supersedes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the logic of what actually is effective.</v>

1402
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a philosophy behind it and I </v>

1403
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>think that philosophy can be effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people.</v>

1404
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.931
<v Speaker 1>And I'm very hypocritical if I say don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something that causes injuries </v>

1405
01:03:50.931 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 1>because I've had a ton of surgeries for </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and injuries from Jujitsu.</v>

1406
01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Or was it like a collision injury or was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just over time?</v>

1407
01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Injuries from knees getting yanked and </v>

1408
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>twisted shoulders getting popped out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socket.</v>

1409
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Get it from working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1410
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:12.321
<v Speaker 1>I got it from sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them I just feel like it's </v>

1411
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1412
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not crazy.</v>

1413
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an athlete,</v>

1414
01:04:15.361 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but like to get injured while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing while you're in the thing,</v>

1415
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't necessarily control that.</v>

1416
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfit competitions in particularly </v>

1417
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>scary to me because there was one video </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this guy who was a,</v>

1418
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he owned a crossfit gym and he was </v>

1419
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:33.771
<v Speaker 1>involved in a competition and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these clean presses and his body </v>

1420
01:04:33.771 --> 01:04:37.221
<v Speaker 1>literally gave out and he dropped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight on the back of his neck and was </v>

1421
01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:40.701
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed from the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a video of it and it's </v>

1422
01:04:40.701 --> 01:04:42.480
<v Speaker 1>horrific to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent me one where someone's up.</v>

1423
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.060
<v Speaker 1>What's your anal sphincter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came out.</v>

1424
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I saw that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1425
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:51.450
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights is your hobby is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1426
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Will he set some goals and he really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to achieve it and that goes to </v>

1427
01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:00.981
<v Speaker 1>blows asshole out like an old song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come back from that stitches,</v>

1428
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>painkillers time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably steroids.</v>

1429
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>He's allowed to take adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>River sand our judgment or.</v>

1430
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should take everything whenever they </v>

1431
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.730
<v Speaker 1>decide to take xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are countries,</v>

1432
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>so over medicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

1433
01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

1434
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It's Tara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Well you really see</v>

1436
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said in these housewives </v>

1437
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 3>communities because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1438
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1439
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 3>sleepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they call them?</v>

1440
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.901
<v Speaker 3>Bedroom communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I go is where white people go to </v>

1441
01:05:27.901 --> 01:05:29.580
<v Speaker 3>breed and that's where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people out in the rain.</v>

1442
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.860
<v Speaker 3>They raised their kids out there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1443
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.580
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of these people that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>become medicated.</v>

1444
01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1445
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean I talked to the women more than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to the men,</v>

1446
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of men that are medicated.</v>

1447
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:45.610
<v Speaker 3>They're on adderall and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The late great.</v>

1448
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Robert Schimmel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a great line,</v>

1449
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He accidentally took an adderall once,</v>

1450
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.610
<v Speaker 3>told me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me,</v>

1451
01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget whose it was,</v>

1452
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:02.370
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he grabbed a pill and he thought he had </v>

1453
01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:02.370
<v Speaker 3>a heart condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.050
<v Speaker 3>before the cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1455
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:09.060
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a bunch of different issues and </v>

1456
01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.951
<v Speaker 3>cancer and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I forget what the medication he </v>

1457
01:06:10.951 --> 01:06:13.771
<v Speaker 3>thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he realized after taking it wasn't </v>

1458
01:06:13.771 --> 01:06:13.771
<v Speaker 3>his and then it was an adderall and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1459
01:06:13.771 --> 01:06:13.960
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

1460
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 3>So I called his doctor up and he told </v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

1461
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>

1462
01:06:17.111 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was this,</v>

1463
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:20.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

1464
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the doctor said,</v>

1465
01:06:22.031 --> 01:06:24.100
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be fine because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be fun.</v>

1466
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:25.010
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1467
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:30.030
<v Speaker 3>x amount of hours to wear off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't worry with that dose and your </v>

1468
01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 3>body and your body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be fine.</v>

1469
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.930
<v Speaker 3>So don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1470
01:06:31.931 --> 01:06:36.931
<v Speaker 3>I went over all my notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said I got a to just start organizing </v>

1471
01:06:36.931 --> 01:06:38.350
<v Speaker 3>all of my comedy notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1472
01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 3>I got so much work done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable how perfectly,</v>

1473
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.140
<v Speaker 3>but it starts to backfire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I remember when I was like,</v>

1474
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:49.170
<v Speaker 3>this is working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept doing it and then the aftermath </v>

1475
01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:49.810
<v Speaker 3>was like I couldn't fall asleep that </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and then I was even more tired the</v>

1476
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:50.920
<v Speaker 3>next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which meant I needed to take more.</v>

1477
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.470
<v Speaker 3>It just becomes an addiction and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>stops being that effective.</v>

1478
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:58.471
<v Speaker 3>If you overuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tait Fletcher put something on his </v>

1479
01:06:58.471 --> 01:07:01.021
<v Speaker 3>instagram today about the strongest cup </v>
<v Speaker 3>of coffee in the world and it's from </v>

<v Speaker 3>So I've taken out of this the strongest </v>

1485
01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:21.691
<v Speaker 3>coffee look at it says they're the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world's strongest cup of coffee's </v>

1486
01:07:21.691 --> 01:07:25.261
<v Speaker 3>outrageously caffeinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has contains 80 times the amount of </v>

1487
01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:30.190
<v Speaker 3>caffeine in the single cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the ass kicker coffee.</v>

1488
01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 3>It's sold at the vicious coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vicious cafe in Australia.</v>

1489
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 3>So what's in it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has four shots of espresso,</v>

1490
01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 3>ate ice cubes of cold brew and a half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cup of 10 day old cold brew.</v>

1491
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 3>That adds up to half the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>caffeine needed for lethal dose.</v>

1492
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bennington created the drink for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nurse completing a night shift.</v>

1493
01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My nurse to be so tired it's meant to be</v>

1494
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:59.461
<v Speaker 3>sipped over three to four hours and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>took the nurse two days to finish the </v>

1495
01:07:59.461 --> 01:08:03.901
<v Speaker 3>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She stayed up for three days after she </v>

1496
01:08:03.901 --> 01:08:03.901
<v Speaker 3>drank it.</v>

1497
01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:10.790
<v Speaker 3>She was seeing rabbits are a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>running around in pajamas at her house </v>

1498
01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:12.060
<v Speaker 3>and rising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>

1499
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look,</v>

1500
01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 3>it's my goal</v>

1501
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.730
<v Speaker 2>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time I was like 28 or 20,</v>

1502
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.760
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed him when I was 31 because I </v>

1503
01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.551
<v Speaker 2>froze my eggs when I was 31 and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe when I noticed it that at 31 I was</v>

1504
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:32.891
<v Speaker 2>on five medications while you froze your</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs because when I froze my eggs,</v>

1505
01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:35.390
<v Speaker 2>they put you on a thyroid medication for</v>
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>

1506
01:08:35.391 --> 01:08:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was on,</v>

1507
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I think to antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a birth control of course,</v>

1508
01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:46.121
<v Speaker 2>which makes me very crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had given me adderall for when I </v>

1509
01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:46.640
<v Speaker 2>needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1510
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I had Lunesta to sleep and I just was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1511
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.180
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have more medications than someone in </v>

1512
01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:55.180
<v Speaker 2>a nursing home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is crazy.</v>

1513
01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 2>And for thousands of years we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>survived without all of these bills,</v>

1514
01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:01.640
<v Speaker 2>like this can't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just noticed this and I don't know</v>

1515
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:02.870
<v Speaker 2>if it's what I do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 2>but just this dismissive instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1517
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:07.580
<v Speaker 2>learned to meditate or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was like,</v>

1518
01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 2>here's a sleeping pill.</v>

1519
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:13.690
<v Speaker 2>And I found myself like restless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irritable and discontent and not </v>

1520
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.050
<v Speaker 2>actually getting quality sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm on the antidote.</v>

1521
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a shell of a person,</v>

1522
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:22.210
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's when I sort of started </v>

1523
01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:22.490
<v Speaker 2>looking into all these medicaid and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I was on coffee and you know,</v>

1524
01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:25.670
<v Speaker 2>all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my body chemistry was just bananas.</v>

1525
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:28.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1526
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally would like to sort of get </v>

1527
01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:33.370
<v Speaker 2>to the root of it or get ahead of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

1528
01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:37.211
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not that housewife in 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's just taken xanax because I've got </v>

1529
01:09:37.211 --> 01:09:40.430
<v Speaker 2>pain or can't deal with discomfort or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety like an adult.</v>

1530
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you have pickled eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eggs?</v>

1531
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:49.090
<v Speaker 2>My eggs are by the beach and Redondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are doing just fine.</v>

1532
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.200
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1533
01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:51.990
<v Speaker 2>they're frozen somewhere.</v>

1534
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 2>A locker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go visit them.</v>

1535
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dead beat mom.</v>

1536
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a terrible mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never go see them.</v>

1537
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't trust that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized.</v>

1538
01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that is the main nightmare</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have.</v>

1539
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 2>You are crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1542

<v Speaker 2>I mean with the Oscar mix up last night.</v>

1543
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:18.840

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1545
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:24.410
<v Speaker 2>They said someone one and then see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically born baby.</v>

1546
01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:26.390

<v Speaker 2>bless his heart.</v>

1547
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so hard not read anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 2>up on stage and then they had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1563
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:06.911
<v Speaker 2>actually it's moonlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when the producers of La La </v>

1564
01:11:06.911 --> 01:11:06.911
<v Speaker 2>land was a total class act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and gentlemen,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moonlight won.</v>

1566
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And then moonlight had to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was mad.</v>

1567
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.400
<v Speaker 2>It was like the super bowl stress level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate those</v>

1568
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>contests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1569
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a dog in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1570
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>What's the expression dog in the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a dog in the fight,</v>

1571
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.460
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1572
01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I hate those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate award shows for art.</v>

1573
01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>They seemed so pretentious.</v>

1574
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Not already one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

1575
01:11:29.631 --> 01:11:31.490
<v Speaker 2>you bought one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have millions of dollars.</v>

1576
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Movie Stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the.</v>

1577
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>

1578
01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean especially with the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate,</v>

1579
01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:38.000
<v Speaker 2>when people go and make political </v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches,</v>

1580
01:11:38.001 --> 01:11:38.990
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1581
01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:41.930
<v Speaker 2>how much did you donate this year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you really do?</v>

1582
01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1583
01:11:42.891 --> 01:11:45.530
<v Speaker 2>just making all these speeches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking the talk.</v>

1584
01:11:45.531 --> 01:11:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I hope everyone is also walking the walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1585
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:50.180
<v Speaker 2>authentic that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1586
01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1587
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:55.750
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there's something </v>

1588
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.790
<v Speaker 2>anesthetic about it for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's.</v>

1589
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Look at the silly monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the diversion of dresses and </v>

1590
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:02.990
<v Speaker 2>necklaces and makeup and actresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1591
01:12:02.991 --> 01:12:07.991
<v Speaker 2>I think humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have probably an inherent need for </v>

1592
01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.590
<v Speaker 2>that sort of diversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of vapid.</v>

1593
01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about dresses instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on.</v>

1594
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And there's always a ribbon that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to wear.</v>

1595
01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the ribbon they had to wear </v>

1596
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:20.750
<v Speaker 1>last night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a blue ribbon for Eclu.</v>

1597
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was for the iceberg that </v>

1598
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.000
<v Speaker 1>was breaking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1599
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're too worried about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant iceberg the size of Manhattan </v>

1600
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:30.050
<v Speaker 1>that's about to fucking die now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1601
01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many,</v>

1602
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just get frustrated sometimes.</v>

1603
01:12:32.841 --> 01:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1604
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:37.490
<v Speaker 1>your listeners are not the ones because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your listeners seem to all be seekers,</v>

1605
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.550
<v Speaker 1>like who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying all girls or all boys</v>

1606
01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.160
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My listeners are a bunch of knuckleheads</v>

1607
01:12:43.161 --> 01:12:46.730
<v Speaker 1>out there that listens to you is smart I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1608
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:48.890
<v Speaker 1>or at least definitely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aspires to be.</v>

1609
01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

1610
01:12:57.590 --> 01:13:01.680
<v Speaker 1>where's Kendall Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who My thongs,</v>

1611
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Blah should be lion hunting porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1612
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you shoot environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck right on top of this.</v>

1613
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that would do well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone buried.</v>

1614
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Desensitized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1615
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what it's coming to you,</v>

1616
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I guess these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag read it.</v>

1617
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1618
01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:24.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's humans have a need to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of disassociate with pictures of </v>

1619
01:13:25.481 --> 01:13:26.020
<v Speaker 2>dresses.</v>

1620
01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely some of that.</v>

1621
01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely the pageantry people </v>
<v Speaker 1>love when people dress up in all their </v>

1622
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>best and they walked through watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1623
01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1624
01:13:36.231 --> 01:13:37.800
<v Speaker 1>it's all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

1625
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1626
01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.710
<v Speaker 1>she's not even happy for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no matter what she does,</v>

1627
01:13:41.711 --> 01:13:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to project to your shed </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto this,</v>

1628
01:13:43.481 --> 01:13:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do secretly not so secretly enjoy.</v>

1629
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I do enjoy watching people as they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older who are clearly fucking crazy.</v>

1630
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less and less.</v>

1631
01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Nicole Kidman was clapping like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grinch last night.</v>

1632
01:13:57.670 --> 01:13:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was clapping.</v>

1633
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

1634
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't clap a lot because we're comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't go to shows.</v>

1635
01:14:06.491 --> 01:14:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't even clap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clap.</v>

1636
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to clap if you have a daughter </v>

1637
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>in play constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all just filming the whole time?</v>

1638
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I club my wife films.</v>

1639
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Clap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a good clapper either.</v>

1641
01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I do it after sac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clap when you.</v>

1642
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1643
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I found it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

1644
01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:27.750
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

1645
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1646
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>She also has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's comically Willoway.</v>

1647
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her nails went.</v>

1648
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something crazy.</v>

1649
01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Carpal tunnel from holding your hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>way back.</v>

1650
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.530
<v Speaker 2>She's doing too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Chrome.</v>

1651
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.770
<v Speaker 2>That's not good for your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

1652
01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I do have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am hyper mobile.</v>

1653
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about hypermobility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a thing.</v>

1654
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot of western European trash </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics that we use our joints instead </v>

1655
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 2>of our muscles when we move and walk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things.</v>

1656
01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 2>And I got this thing called Costco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chondritis.</v>

1657
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm pronouncing that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically when your cartilage and </v>

1658
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 2>flames and it was in my chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be like,</v>

1659
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 2>it's like a relative of plural cbds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1660
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I did have pneumonia and didn't treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1661
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:15.810
<v Speaker 2>but I had so much stress in my back that</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1662
01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cartilage or my ribs started rubbing</v>

1663
01:15:18.251 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 2>I guess against each other.</v>

1664
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.550
<v Speaker 2>And I went to this rheumatologist who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1665
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a hyper mobile,</v>

1666
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>which means you don't walk with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>

1667
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:29.671
<v Speaker 2>you walk with your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where all of the impact goes and </v>

1668
01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:32.611
<v Speaker 2>you need to relearn how to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need to cushion yourself with </v>

1669
01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.240
<v Speaker 2>your muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not using your muscles.</v>

1670
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1671
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:39.901
<v Speaker 2>you're basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked just like a Zombie.</v>

1672
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I walked like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1673
01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 2>what that mean in the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thriller video,</v>

1674
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:49.080
<v Speaker 2>just like everything's all wonky and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1675
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:54.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's where all and that's how he's </v>

1676
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people when they're 55 have </v>

1677
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:58.441
<v Speaker 2>non collision injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you hear about people who </v>

1678
01:15:58.441 --> 01:15:58.441
<v Speaker 2>like sneeze and throw them back out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1679
01:15:58.441 --> 01:15:59.350
<v Speaker 2>there's so much impact over so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time.</v>

1680
01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to a [inaudible] instructor </v>
<v Speaker 2>who specializes in this and I was just </v>

1681
01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to hold a rubber band and like walk </v>

1682
01:16:08.491 --> 01:16:08.491
<v Speaker 2>like it was so boring that I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped going.</v>

1683
01:16:08.491 --> 01:16:13.250
<v Speaker 1>This podcast is going to be really fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to the DM people's </v>

1684
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.250
<v Speaker 1>interpretations when they remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything poorly.</v>

1685
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Kendall Jenner killed a lion and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't walk right into death.</v>

1686
01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's definitely on adderall.</v>

1687
01:16:20.081 --> 01:16:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to hear the recap,</v>

1688
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:22.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1689
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 1>of this bike us something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>botox in her face and reached way to her</v>

1690
01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:32.610
<v Speaker 1>fingertips and she couldn't keep him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was shitting out so much mct oil that</v>

1691
01:16:32.611 --> 01:16:34.740
<v Speaker 1>she actually couldn't even clap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1692
01:16:34.741 --> 01:16:36.870
<v Speaker 1>there is something going on with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Nicole Kidman's,</v>

1693
01:16:36.871 --> 01:16:41.871
<v Speaker 1>phase two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's definitely shooting some stuff in </v>

1694
01:16:41.871 --> 01:16:43.821
<v Speaker 1>her face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got some weird sort of frozen </v>

1695
01:16:43.821 --> 01:16:43.821
<v Speaker 1>appearance thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1696
01:16:43.821 --> 01:16:48.500
<v Speaker 2>weird to me because people accused me of</v>
<v Speaker 2>having worked in and do you see my in my</v>

1697
01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:51.860
<v Speaker 2>forehead I have wrinkles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of how,</v>

1698
01:16:51.861 --> 01:16:56.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone has wrinkles there that they </v>

1699
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:57.290
<v Speaker 2>haven't had botox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when people say I had worked on,</v>

1700
01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just tried to take it as a compliment,</v>

1701
01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:03.080
<v Speaker 2>but will they just assume everybody gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>work done?</v>

1702
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:08.110
<v Speaker 2>That's just an assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what a doctor said to me because </v>

1703
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:09.240
<v Speaker 2>I said to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had really bad under eye bags,</v>

1704
01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a TV show like bad,</v>

1705
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 2>like they looked like I look like Steve </v>
<v Speaker 2>Buscemi.</v>

1706
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.660
<v Speaker 2>It was not because they just weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping.</v>

1707
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sleeping and I was not eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1708
01:17:16.551 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't hydrated and as too much salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And genetically,</v>

1709
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my genetics are a disaster and my mom,</v>

1710
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:23.570
<v Speaker 2>everybody has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fat.</v>

1711
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not really something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ice Sleep,</v>

1712
01:17:26.151 --> 01:17:28.220
<v Speaker 2>nothing helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1713
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:33.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a bunch of doctors and their </v>

1714
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.310
<v Speaker 2>solution is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

1715
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:34.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can put filler.</v>

1716
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.820
<v Speaker 2>They call that one guy called it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pillar,</v>

1717
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:41.360
<v Speaker 2>like we build a pillar to fill it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1718
01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:42.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian.</v>

1719
01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't just get a new face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1720
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I can't do the Joan rivers thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just not the carrot top or </v>

1721
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1722
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:53.070
<v Speaker 2>and basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1723
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:54.530
<v Speaker 2>he explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1724
01:17:54.531 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't have bad where I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is not good.</v>

1725
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Work is so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said something interesting what </v>

1726
01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:01.840
<v Speaker 2>you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1727
01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:01.840
<v Speaker 2>you only notice the bad work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1728
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets it done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the good but the good work you don't</v>

1729
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.970
<v Speaker 2>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1730
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's sort of what he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

1731
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Which he was probably just manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1732
01:18:10.551 --> 01:18:14.030
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't end up doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he puts it in there.</v>

1733
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.240
<v Speaker 2>But this is like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm talking like a rapist trying </v>

1734
01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:24.791
<v Speaker 2>to control someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in he explained to me because I was </v>

1735
01:18:24.791 --> 01:18:27.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody just kind of looks like </v>

1736
01:18:27.491 --> 01:18:27.491
<v Speaker 2>swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just been punched in the cheek,</v>

1737
01:18:27.491 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 2>but that's what happens when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>filler.</v>

1738
01:18:28.821 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to build everything out.</v>

1739
01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 2>It's becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do this,</v>

1740
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.300
<v Speaker 2>you got to do this because you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1741
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 2>So once you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no going back.</v>

1742
01:18:37.491 --> 01:18:39.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm actually noticing it in men a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit too.</v>

1743
01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1744
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.380
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why is that like the,</v>

1745
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like hgh,</v>

1746
01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:48.800
<v Speaker 2>just like the male version of Botox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1747
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:53.830
<v Speaker 2>guys do like that sort of thing for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just something that puts your body's </v>

1748
01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 2>hormones to the same level.</v>

1749
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.320
<v Speaker 2>It was when you were younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

1750
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but you get cut back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1751
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1752
01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 2>your metabolism increases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are valued by this.</v>

1753
01:19:02.841 --> 01:19:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Men are sort of valued by their brute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1754
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a guy starts botoxing his face,</v>

1755
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.010
<v Speaker 2>like I've met guys before in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>forehead doesn't move.</v>

1756
01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with your forehead,</v>

1757
01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how,</v>

1758
01:19:12.261 --> 01:19:13.030
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.110
<v Speaker 2>So you have wrinkles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have shiny,</v>

1760
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.060
<v Speaker 2>shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:19:17.061 --> 01:19:20.780
<v Speaker 2>But it gets a weird shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what else that is like,</v>

1762
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:25.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just a mct covered wax figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just looks weird like it's pulled in </v>

1763
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 2>yet because that's a couple things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>found out.</v>

1764
01:19:29.301 --> 01:19:33.170
<v Speaker 2>So I am like shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also put like oil all over my face</v>

1765
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:34.490
<v Speaker 2>and sunscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good.</v>

1766
01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm always like,</v>

1767
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:36.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1768
01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 2>but because I think that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>preventative,</v>

1769
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:40.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1770
01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.400
<v Speaker 2>but lasering your face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you laser your face?</v>

1771
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1772
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:49.091
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do laser to prevent it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a lot of sun damage but what </v>

1773
01:19:49.091 --> 01:19:51.390
<v Speaker 2>that does is it removes the hairs on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your face and then that's shining.</v>

1774
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>

1775
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:55.430
<v Speaker 2>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have micro scares.</v>

1776
01:19:55.431 --> 01:19:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Peach Fuzz,</v>

1777
01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:00.500
<v Speaker 2>which is what deflects the light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have that you get shiny.</v>

1778
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So my dermatologist was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should slow down on the laser because</v>

1779
01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:07.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to look like a wax figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm already pushing it,</v>

1780
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I scan with the laser is like,</v>

1781
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:14.580
<v Speaker 2>is it similar to like they say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women get more wrinkles or on their face</v>

1782
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:17.940
<v Speaker 2>because they met than men because men </v>
<v Speaker 2>exfoliate when they shave.</v>

1783
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I maybe that's why I don't have wrinkles</v>

1784
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 2>like men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men get less lines around their lips and</v>

1785
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:30.760
<v Speaker 2>around the corners of their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to fake laugh as much as</v>

1786
01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:30.760
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

1787
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:37.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to gamble at bar is all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1788
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Why is that a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1789
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:41.510
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1790
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.280
<v Speaker 2>we're men like women to laugh at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not odd.</v>

1791
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.740
<v Speaker 2>It's feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's feedback,</v>

1792
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:48.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't the other way.</v>

1793
01:20:48.241 --> 01:20:53.241
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a lot of now laugh at </v>

1794
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:53.241
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Guy.</v>

1795
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:53.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1796
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:57.471
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's making a guy laugh as an act of </v>

1797
01:20:57.471 --> 01:20:57.471
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a competitive.</v>

1798
01:20:57.471 --> 01:21:00.930
<v Speaker 2>It's competitive stone thrown for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1799
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1805
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 2>same as people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can also get on there if you're rich</v>

1806
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 2>or have to be like a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an approval board.</v>

1807
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have like an approval code.</v>

1808
01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck on the approval committee.</v>

1809
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1810
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1811
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:31.850
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting gaggle of monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find there's something very </v>

1812
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:35.970
<v Speaker 2>fascinating and you can probably answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guys are so mean with their openers</v>

1813
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're like,</v>

1815
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that instead of like,</v>

1816
01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to match with you.</v>

1817
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:47.301
<v Speaker 2>It's usually an aggressive quip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1818
01:21:48.121 --> 01:21:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Well those guys block them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1819
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1821
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I definitely like being funny.</v>

1822
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about it,</v>

1823
01:21:55.201 --> 01:21:56.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1824
01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm always fascinated by non physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of aggression.</v>

1825
01:21:59.161 --> 01:22:04.161
<v Speaker 2>Like eye contact is a form of aggression</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of like if you walked into a </v>

1826
01:22:04.161 --> 01:22:04.350
<v Speaker 2>bar and made eye contact with a guy from</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 10 seconds,</v>

1827
01:22:04.351 --> 01:22:04.830
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1828
01:22:04.831 --> 01:22:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean not just because you're Joe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogen,</v>

1829
01:22:06.061 --> 01:22:11.061
<v Speaker 2>but if you were anyone like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye contact is like without saying </v>

1830
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:11.061
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1831
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:11.061
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1832
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's cool.</v>

1833
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1834
01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:16.620
<v Speaker 2>we going to fight her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1835
01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something stablish tone.</v>

1836
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Eye contact is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1837
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>break dancing.</v>

1838
01:22:22.891 --> 01:22:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I was obsessed with break dancing for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

1839
01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:27.230
<v Speaker 2>I cannot pop.</v>

1840
01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm hyper mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my knees locked all the time.</v>

1841
01:22:32.791 --> 01:22:37.791
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by accident I wanted to make a </v>

1842
01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:40.221
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started making it in college and I </v>

1843
01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:40.560
<v Speaker 2>would go to these break dancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions in the bronx and uh,</v>

1844
01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I was fascinated by when there's break </v>
<v Speaker 2>dance battles,</v>

1845
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:48.531
<v Speaker 2>if violence goes down in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like what we were talking about </v>

1846
01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:49.940
<v Speaker 2>the other day earlier today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has not been a daylong pockets,</v>

1847
01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:51.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1848
01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:56.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are substitutes for violence or </v>

1849
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.480
<v Speaker 2>they get the same needs met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That violence gives us competition and,</v>

1850
01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:01.620
<v Speaker 2>and break dancing is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rap Battles is one of them.</v>

1851
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think comedy is one of them.</v>

1852
01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if comedy and a lot of my standup </v>

1853
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 2>comes from a place of self defense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the implication is you're my attacker.</v>

1854
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 2>So I think that I probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1855
01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

1856
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:20.880
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always imagined that your kind of </v>

1857
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 2>comedy comes from you being forced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze your surroundings.</v>

1858
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.880
<v Speaker 2>That is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you had to make light of </v>

1859
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.430
<v Speaker 2>distressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like gallows humor.</v>

1860
01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is true.</v>

1861
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 2>But I did the roasts for awhile and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1862
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a that has an aggressive form of.</v>

1863
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 2>He wrote back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not do the roast battle.</v>

1864
01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I was a judge on one of the ones this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

1865
01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:39.730
<v Speaker 2>but I used to do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the rest.</v>

1866
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:41.740
<v Speaker 2>You were a judge on the comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1867
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:43.930
<v Speaker 2>And we were fucking howling because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>

1868
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 2>the comedians bar the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you were that young girl.</v>

1869
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Olivia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

1870
01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1871
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I know she's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's great.</v>

1872
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.220
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's great.</v>

1873
01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were going on about her being </v>

1874
01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.170
<v Speaker 2>brave and overcoming like trauma and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that and we're like,</v>

1875
01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whitney,</v>

1876
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 2>she can't help it psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze this young lady.</v>

1877
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing is because roast battle</v>

1878
01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>was so interesting to me because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't famous,</v>

1879
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you just have to attack their personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and she was on the one that I did </v>

1880
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taped one and everyone was like,</v>

1881
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Olivia has been raped by a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I was just like,</v>

1882
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.870
<v Speaker 2>are we just all to pretend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean because you know,</v>

1883
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:31.890
<v Speaker 2>comedy is our anesthesia and we make </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes to deflect and to not have to </v>

1884
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:31.890
<v Speaker 2>really deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was just like,</v>

1885
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:36.361
<v Speaker 2>don't get it twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to have to deal with </v>

1886
01:24:36.361 --> 01:24:36.640
<v Speaker 2>being raped one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're all laughing and you're going</v>

1887
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:39.390
<v Speaker 2>to get a paycheck at the end of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is like an open thing.</v>

1888
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.610
<v Speaker 2>She talked about it or it was on the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would.</v>

1889
01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:45.180
<v Speaker 2>The taping I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

1890
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.810
<v Speaker 2>and then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1891
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Mark's brother has autism and committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide joke,</v>

1892
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:51.370
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

1893
01:24:51.371 --> 01:24:53.800
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too brutal.</v>

1894
01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Even this is too brutal for me because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the mental ramifications of this </v>

1895
01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.361
<v Speaker 2>kind of pain and we're all just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending like this person isn't in a </v>

1896
01:25:03.361 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of pink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like 20,</v>

1897
01:25:04.190 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally she's 20.</v>

1898
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I met her when she was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1899
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 2>She came to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a beast.</v>

1900
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.230
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's worse than being ratio.</v>

1901
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean she had even more trauma than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought she was out there for something.</v>

1902
01:25:21.461 --> 01:25:25.000
<v Speaker 2>I forget what she was out there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reached out to her and I was like,</v>

1903
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me fucking funny.</v>

1904
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1905
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in I think Montreal or </v>

1906
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:32.700
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she fell off the stage and it ripped her</v>

1907
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:36.420
<v Speaker 2>calf open and she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she did the roast battle the </v>

1908
01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 2>next night in a wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is a warrior,</v>

1909
01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but I as someone who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not comparing my experience to her,</v>

1910
01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but someone who is 20 who started doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

1911
01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:44.530
<v Speaker 2>who joked about my pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit caught up with me.</v>

1912
01:25:44.531 --> 01:25:47.560
<v Speaker 2>You can try it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run it the same way,</v>

1913
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 2>walked watches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fix it.</v>

1914
01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:50.450
<v Speaker 2>And cars don't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughs.</v>

1915
01:25:50.451 --> 01:25:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either.</v>

1916
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Know Freddy Prince in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work and neither does the </v>

1917
01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:56.130
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1918
01:25:56.130 --> 01:26:00.980
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it's like when you laugh at </v>

1919
01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>pain and then it just becomes a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pain is still there.</v>

1920
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like you didn't kill it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>laughter.</v>

1921
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:07.710
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just sort of like you.</v>

1922
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:13.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like throwing a bunch of gauze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bandages over a swimming pool or no </v>

1923
01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 3>pool.</v>

1924
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.900
<v Speaker 2>We'll follow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a,</v>

1925
01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:21.930
<v Speaker 2>it is a temporary way I think to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your power back over your damage or to </v>

1926
01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:25.210
<v Speaker 2>is to alchemize it or sublimated into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something lucrative or positive.</v>

1927
01:26:25.211 --> 01:26:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Like my negative experience kind of paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>for my house,</v>

1928
01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:30.250
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain point and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated like,</v>

1929
01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>

1930
01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I personally think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can't speak for every field,</v>

1931
01:26:34.091 --> 01:26:39.091
<v Speaker 2>but in our field in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've lost a couple too many </v>

1932
01:26:39.091 --> 01:26:39.430
<v Speaker 2>comedians to suicide that just kinda </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out of nowhere.</v>

1933
01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:42.160
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did that happen?</v>

1934
01:26:42.161 --> 01:26:44.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you think you heard it?</v>

1935
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:47.590
<v Speaker 2>You heard him every night on the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this so shocking to us?</v>

1936
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:49.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1937
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I just,</v>

1938
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:53.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not my business necessarily,</v>

1939
01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:55.060
<v Speaker 2>but whenever I see a young comic with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray,</v>

1940
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him know if you talk about it.</v>

1941
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's very nice of you.</v>

1942
01:26:58.821 --> 01:27:03.821
<v Speaker 3>Now it makes sense because I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I walked into the bar right when </v>

1943
01:27:03.821 --> 01:27:06.590
<v Speaker 3>they had finished and you or we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissecting.</v>

1944
01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can't help.</v>

1945
01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Like psychologically analyzing,</v>

1946
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:15.850
<v Speaker 2>well that's like me important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't enjoy porn because I'm too </v>

1947
01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 2>worried about the girl and like why </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's doing it in comedy.</v>

1948
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she's talking about being raped,</v>

1949
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we call a helpline?</v>

1950
01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:23.670
<v Speaker 3>I remember I read a story about a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was in porn that I'd seen in a bunch</v>

1951
01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.040
<v Speaker 3>of porn films that blew his brains out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1952
01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:27.450
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1953
01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:32.451
<v Speaker 3>even the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of these people that get </v>

1954
01:27:32.451 --> 01:27:32.451
<v Speaker 3>involved in porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they.</v>

1955
01:27:32.451 --> 01:27:35.550
<v Speaker 3>They came here to be an actor and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't work out and then somewhere along</v>

1956
01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:36.570
<v Speaker 3>the line someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1957
01:27:36.571 --> 01:27:38.130
<v Speaker 3>you make $2,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fuck.</v>

1958
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 3>And they went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1959
01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then back then they really could </v>

1960
01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.410
<v Speaker 3>make a lot of money doing porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's even stranger because the money</v>

1961
01:27:46.411 --> 01:27:48.150
<v Speaker 3>went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a guy who was a porn star</v>

1962
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:53.360
<v Speaker 3>and he was producing films and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lives a few doors down from me and I </v>

1963
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:53.360
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1964
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.750
<v Speaker 3>this guy's ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these bond from porn.</v>

1965
01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:59.900
<v Speaker 3>And then the internet came along and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how the Internet crippled a lot of </v>

1966
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:04.080
<v Speaker 3>industries and the people cared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people cared about the internet,</v>

1967
01:28:04.081 --> 01:28:06.240
<v Speaker 3>crippling the record industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a big deal.</v>

1968
01:28:06.241 --> 01:28:10.680
<v Speaker 3>The napster issue is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No buddy gave a fuck about porn.</v>

1969
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:12.090
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very strange thing.</v>

1970
01:28:12.091 --> 01:28:15.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our shame and watching other people have</v>

1971
01:28:15.151 --> 01:28:15.790
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1972
01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:19.290
<v Speaker 3>it transferred over to commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the actual commerce of porn,</v>

1973
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:24.470
<v Speaker 3>which is totally legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was completely and totally ignored that </v>

1974
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:27.060
<v Speaker 3>industry essentially vanished and had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>regroup and refigure itself out.</v>

1975
01:28:27.061 --> 01:28:29.190
<v Speaker 3>And I don't understand the economics of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1976
01:28:29.191 --> 01:28:34.191
<v Speaker 3>I've never really looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that they don't have DVD </v>

1977
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:34.191
<v Speaker 3>sales anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda gone.</v>

1978
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:39.020
<v Speaker 2>And there's also something </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically really annihilating </v>

1979
01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.870
<v Speaker 2>about being seen and then not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

1980
01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1981
01:28:42.541 --> 01:28:47.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what this person's </v>

1982
01:28:47.541 --> 01:28:47.580
<v Speaker 2>experienced as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't pretend to know why that guy did</v>

1983
01:28:47.581 --> 01:28:52.581
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was mark Burnett was </v>

1984
01:28:52.581 --> 01:28:54.180
<v Speaker 2>talking like reality stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them killed themselves after</v>

1985
01:28:54.181 --> 01:28:59.181
<v Speaker 2>they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have it and then it's taken </v>

1986
01:28:59.181 --> 01:28:59.181
<v Speaker 2>away from them or they're seen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then not.</v>

1987
01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:01.080
<v Speaker 2>And there's something really fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Spencer,</v>

1988
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1989
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 2>like totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how you self destruct after,</v>

1990
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>

1991
01:29:06.301 --> 01:29:09.900
<v Speaker 2>we don't like things being taken away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from us but especially being seen and we</v>

1992
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:12.630
<v Speaker 2>get feel safe or dopamine or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is from being seen.</v>

1993
01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:17.631
<v Speaker 2>And then we're not seeing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And porn is probably the most insidious </v>

1994
01:29:17.631 --> 01:29:18.900
<v Speaker 2>in a way because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I even find myself and I'm not as</v>

1995
01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:20.200
<v Speaker 2>famous as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1996
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 2>but when I don't know if people know me </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>

1997
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel really unsafe.</v>

1998
01:29:25.710 --> 01:29:30.710
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm sitting next to someone on a </v>

1999
01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 2>plane and this happens kind of a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2000
01:29:32.611 --> 01:29:33.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2001
01:29:33.061 --> 01:29:34.870
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't recognize me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I changed my hair color,</v>

2002
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:39.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't recognize me now </v>

2003
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:41.540
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or cool and I'm doing this and I'm like </v>

2004
01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.791
<v Speaker 2>doing my dm of writing my Dick Jokes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm picking my nose or doing whatever </v>

2005
01:29:43.791 --> 01:29:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the flight he's like,</v>

2006
01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I just want to let you know I'm a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>

2007
01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2008
01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:51.801
<v Speaker 2>I thought we had an agreement that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were just strangers and now you've </v>

2009
01:29:51.801 --> 01:29:53.020
<v Speaker 2>completely betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2010
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:54.180
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2011
01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.250
<v Speaker 2>and then I just get into this weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchcock like paranoia of like,</v>

2012
01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:02.270
<v Speaker 2>who knows me who doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my codependence I have to be </v>

2013
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:03.570
<v Speaker 2>able to behave in an authentic way </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether people recognize me or not,</v>

2014
01:30:03.571 --> 01:30:08.571
<v Speaker 2>but it's just sort of this creepy </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling I imagined doing porn because </v>

2015
01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:10.530
<v Speaker 2>way more people watch porn and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch anything I've ever done.</v>

2016
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.880
<v Speaker 2>So I'd imagine so many people recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy but would never say anything.</v>

2017
01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Just this weird like secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2018
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a very pernicious </v>

2019
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:25.581
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not knowing who knows you and who </v>

2020
01:30:25.581 --> 01:30:25.581
<v Speaker 2>doesn't and everyone pretending they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know you.</v>

2021
01:30:25.581 --> 01:30:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of people come up to me and</v>

2022
01:30:27.481 --> 01:30:30.570
<v Speaker 2>this was always very like weird guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>will come up to me.</v>

2023
01:30:30.571 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2024
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my girlfriend loves you.</v>

2025
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:39.471
<v Speaker 2>So can we get a photo of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're just hurting my look what's </v>

2026
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:42.000
<v Speaker 2>happening or when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2027
01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:42.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>

2028
01:30:42.701 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an intern.</v>

2029
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I can tell they're pretending not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to and then I have to engage in this </v>

2030
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.431
<v Speaker 2>weird bad improv game with and I imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn stars because there's so much shame</v>

2031
01:30:53.701 --> 01:30:54.690
<v Speaker 2>in admitting you watch it.</v>

2032
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:57.500
<v Speaker 2>People know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't say anything yet.</v>

2033
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's ever going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

2034
01:30:59.251 --> 01:31:03.120
<v Speaker 2>The shame of admitting you watch other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have sex and that you masturbate.</v>

2035
01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two shames.</v>

2036
01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.100
<v Speaker 2>They're watching it and there's a shame </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll.</v>

2037
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Why do you watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just watch it.</v>

2038
01:31:08.731 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Just because I'm interested in just </v>
<v Speaker 2>beating off.</v>

2039
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:14.760
<v Speaker 2>You're slapping your posts that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something.</v>

2040
01:31:14.761 --> 01:31:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Something crazy is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2041
01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it is so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's obviously rooted in </v>

2042
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:24.471
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that it's parenting </v>

2043
01:31:24.471 --> 01:31:24.870
<v Speaker 2>instincts that sort of echoed from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that people came over in the boat.</v>

2044
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I feel very safe when I know men </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbate because I'm like,</v>

2045
01:31:27.961 --> 01:31:29.550
<v Speaker 2>you're getting your needs met in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy way.</v>

2046
01:31:29.551 --> 01:31:33.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not just fucking holes in walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>once a month and like doing,</v>

2047
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you feel safe.</v>

2048
01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I feel safe when I know that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like waiting for the other shoe to drop.</v>

2049
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if I feel like if men don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbate,</v>

2050
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:44.600
<v Speaker 2>where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is it where you're just gonna just</v>

2051
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.330
<v Speaker 2>shoot someone like random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2052
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know.</v>

2053
01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2054
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys who have stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating and because they made them </v>

2055
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.570
<v Speaker 2>too crazy and they've managed to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>years without it and they don't.</v>

2056
01:31:57.630 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem really and like,</v>

2057
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 2>because I think there were sick of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a puppet of this,</v>

2058
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:07.891
<v Speaker 2>like constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't pretend to know what it's like </v>

2059
01:32:07.891 --> 01:32:07.891
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>

2060
01:32:07.891 --> 01:32:10.980
<v Speaker 3>There's an insidious thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>with human beings when they don't have </v>

2061
01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 3>intimate interactions with people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

2062
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:14.570
<v Speaker 3>People that normally would come carrot </v>
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>

2063
01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know if he's.</v>

2064
01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2065
01:32:18.321 --> 01:32:23.321
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I see comedians who don't hang </v>

2066
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:23.321
<v Speaker 2>out with other Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>

2067
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:23.321
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't good.</v>

2068
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:24.350
<v Speaker 2>This isn't gonna go well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of comedians that are</v>

2069
01:32:24.351 --> 01:32:27.140
<v Speaker 2>like super competitive and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like other Comedians,</v>

2070
01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.290
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird because there's so few</v>

2071
01:32:30.291 --> 01:32:32.990
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the least competitive field you can</v>

2072
01:32:32.991 --> 01:32:35.520
<v Speaker 2>go into in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2073
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:38.360
<v Speaker 2>There's so much demand for comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of comedy clubs.</v>

2074
01:32:38.361 --> 01:32:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Someone else doing well helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2075
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.490
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2076
01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:45.530
<v Speaker 2>how many comedy clubs are there and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many comedians are there?</v>

2077
01:32:45.531 --> 01:32:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about this,</v>

2078
01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.230
<v Speaker 2>like how many comedians can do an hour?</v>

2079
01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I think there's 500 working professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>headline and Comedians in this country.</v>

2080
01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I think there's maybe 500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's a thousand and I think 500</v>

2081
01:32:57.301 --> 01:32:57.680
<v Speaker 3>of them probably</v>

2082
01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:01.000
<v Speaker 2>they can sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can sell a thousand Friday.</v>

2083
01:33:01.130 --> 01:33:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand seats.</v>

2085
01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.670
<v Speaker 2>It goes down to one theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It goes down to what caused that</v>

2087
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 3>200 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 200 maybe.</v>

2088
01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.440
<v Speaker 3>$200.</v>

2090
01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any other field that has that </v>

2091
01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 2>few people besides like Tiffany Glass </v>
<v Speaker 2>makers or something?</v>

2092
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like neuroscientists or something.</v>

2093
01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:25.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one at every college and there's</v>

2094
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:27.970
<v Speaker 2>how many colleges in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of shit comics too,</v>

2095
01:33:27.971 --> 01:33:29.980
<v Speaker 2>just like there's probably a lot of shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurosurgeons,</v>

2096
01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but there is this sort of false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean granted to be a comedian,</v>

2097
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:33.990
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2098
01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.360
<v Speaker 2>probably in fight or flight mode anyway </v>
<v Speaker 2>or some sort of competitive thing </v>

2099
01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:39.730
<v Speaker 2>because it's so hard to do that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do make it.</v>

2100
01:33:39.731 --> 01:33:44.731
<v Speaker 2>There's a very specific neurology there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the competition among comedians as </v>

2101
01:33:44.731 --> 01:33:44.731
<v Speaker 2>so odd to me.</v>

2102
01:33:44.731 --> 01:33:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Well I remember being um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into it straight from fighting and</v>

2103
01:33:49.271 --> 01:33:54.271
<v Speaker 3>I remember being super jealous of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were doing well when I was just </v>

2104
01:33:54.271 --> 01:33:58.621
<v Speaker 3>starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd see someone on stage on black </v>

2105
01:33:58.621 --> 01:33:58.621
<v Speaker 3>keys aren't even funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I get up there?</v>

2106
01:33:58.621 --> 01:34:02.120
<v Speaker 3>And then I recognized maybe like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years in,</v>

2107
01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:03.040
<v Speaker 3>in my career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2108
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:04.990
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a dumb way to think.</v>

2109
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:10.200
<v Speaker 3>And this is some really self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I constantly would just reading </v>

2110
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:14.880
<v Speaker 3>psychology books and self help books and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just constant trying to analyze my mind </v>

2111
01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 3>because I knew that insecurity was </v>
<v Speaker 3>tripping me up.</v>

2112
01:34:15.821 --> 01:34:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Whether it was in fighting or whether it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in comedy insecurity,</v>

2113
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.230
<v Speaker 3>like a weird little demon that wrecks </v>
<v Speaker 3>havoc on them.</v>

2114
01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Met a lot of times masquerades as </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence and ambition.</v>

2115
01:34:26.241 --> 01:34:27.170
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to</v>

2116
01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:28.160
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2117
01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:30.960
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even masquerade with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would pretend it did.</v>

2118
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:32.970
<v Speaker 3>That would pretend I was confident even </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I wasn't.</v>

2119
01:34:32.971 --> 01:34:37.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I realized somewhere along the line </v>

2120
01:34:37.971 --> 01:34:38.220
<v Speaker 3>that that line of thinking was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous.</v>

2121
01:34:38.221 --> 01:34:41.430
<v Speaker 3>It was tripping me up and it was keeping</v>
<v Speaker 3>me from reaching my full potential.</v>

2122
01:34:41.431 --> 01:34:46.431
<v Speaker 3>So instead what I realized somewhere I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a heart to heart with myself and I </v>

2123
01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:51.141
<v Speaker 3>realized like I got into comedy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I love comedy and now all of a sudden I </v>

2124
01:34:51.141 --> 01:34:53.070
<v Speaker 3>don't love it anymore because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's doing well,</v>

2125
01:34:53.071 --> 01:34:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2126
01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:59.121
<v Speaker 3>why didn't I think of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or why did I come up with that joke or </v>

2127
01:34:59.121 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 3>why he so much better than me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized like,</v>

2128
01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 3>oh you have to be a fan and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioner,</v>

2129
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 3>like you have to stop and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to support of the comedians and you have</v>

2130
01:35:05.271 --> 01:35:08.000
<v Speaker 3>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt hard for me to say,</v>

2131
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this guy the other night.</v>

2132
01:35:09.901 --> 01:35:11.400
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2133
01:35:11.410 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 3>he's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then somewhere along the line,</v>

2134
01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:16.310
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of years in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started doing that again.</v>

2135
01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:21.311
<v Speaker 3>I started being a fan of comedy again </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I started running with it and </v>

2136
01:35:21.311 --> 01:35:24.191
<v Speaker 3>then I realized how few people did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then do you think for supportive of </v>

2137
01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:28.730
<v Speaker 3>all the other comedians around me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then develop like a whole clan of people</v>

2138
01:35:28.731 --> 01:35:31.790
<v Speaker 3>that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you've noticed like my friends,</v>

2139
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 3>like all my really closest comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

2140
01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.220
<v Speaker 3>we're all super supportive.</v>

2141
01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I love that about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

2142
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2143
01:35:38.561 --> 01:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>but how did you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have to get a,</v>

2144
01:35:41.530 --> 01:35:44.080
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of success before that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>

2145
01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Or is that why you success?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably part of it.</v>

2146
01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2147
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:48.800
<v Speaker 3>it definitely happened before my </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

2148
01:35:48.801 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I was helping people when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

2149
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2150
01:35:51.921 --> 01:35:56.921
<v Speaker 3>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that there was something </v>

2151
01:35:56.921 --> 01:35:56.921
<v Speaker 3>wrong with my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:35:56.921 --> 01:36:01.020
<v Speaker 3>it's the same as martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't get good by denying that </v>

2153
01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:04.631
<v Speaker 3>other people are good at good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>respecting the fact that other people </v>

2154
01:36:04.631 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 3>are good looking at yourself and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective analysis of your own skills.</v>

2155
01:36:06.531 --> 01:36:07.370
<v Speaker 3>And they realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2156
01:36:07.371 --> 01:36:09.380
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of work to do to reach that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's level.</v>

2157
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2158
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.430
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at me.</v>

2159
01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2160
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 2>and I definitely had that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning a lot to where,</v>

2161
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:18.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in the beginning for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was so much about just dealing </v>

2162
01:36:18.941 --> 01:36:19.670
<v Speaker 2>with aggressive people and recreating my</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood circumstances.</v>

2163
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.580
<v Speaker 2>You weren't really there when I first </v>
<v Speaker 2>started the comedy store.</v>

2164
01:36:22.581 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 2>You sort of had your respite from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store.</v>

2165
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:29.570
<v Speaker 2>But I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hazed so hard and I,</v>

2166
01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fine now and we are totally </v>

2167
01:36:35.931 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 2>friends now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Ran David Taylor.</v>

2168
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh David has female issues and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine now.</v>

2169
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And we worked through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really hard for a long time.</v>

2170
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:52.540
<v Speaker 2>But Ari has already never told you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about how he hit my backpack.</v>

2171
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
<v Speaker 2>No amazing story where every night when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go on stage,</v>

2172
01:36:58.761 --> 01:36:59.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

2173
01:36:59.570 --> 01:37:01.310
<v Speaker 2>like in the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original room,</v>

2174
01:37:01.311 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least my kind of like,</v>

2175
01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:07.160
<v Speaker 2>it was my church and a lot of ways in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

2176
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick as that sounds like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>back booth like that back row of booths.</v>

2177
01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:17.831
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of for VIP and Mitzi shore </v>
<v Speaker 2>when she would come in and then there's </v>

2178
01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:17.831
<v Speaker 2>that hallway in the back where they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinks up.</v>

2179
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:19.770
<v Speaker 2>So I would have a backpack every night I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would go in,</v>

2180
01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I would put my backpack up there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was super dark in there.</v>

2181
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And One night I was onstage at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>comical,</v>

2182
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:30.060
<v Speaker 2>like one in the morning slot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like after Don Maurice was like,</v>

2183
01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:32.720
<v Speaker 2>was what I would sort of go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2184
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I had just had my wallet stolen or my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house broken into and someone stole my </v>

2185
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:41.831
<v Speaker 2>wallet like two days before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was already in fight or flight </v>

2186
01:37:41.831 --> 01:37:44.021
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got offstage and I couldn't find </v>

2187
01:37:44.021 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 2>my backpack and I'm like running around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2188
01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.440
<v Speaker 2>it's so dark in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2189
01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.690
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2190
01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I got so scared that someone was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because basically what a security person</v>

2191
01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 2>that helped me said someone who you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably with all the time,</v>

2192
01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 2>took your credit card,</v>

2193
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>copied it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then put it back in your wallet.</v>

2194
01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Like because someone had mentioned there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a big Bank of America scandal where </v>

2195
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:05.170
<v Speaker 1>they copied like 2000 credit cards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2197
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:11.451
<v Speaker 1>I was a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got in my head that there was </v>

2198
01:38:11.451 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 1>someone in my life around me who took my</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card and like copied it.</v>

2199
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I was freaking out and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was probably so funny.</v>

2200
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And then I started crying like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterically,</v>

2201
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 1>like freaking out crying and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already selling me crying.</v>

2202
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.720
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not owning up to this,</v>

2203
01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 1>just like fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just,</v>

2204
01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me later like we just thought it</v>

2205
01:38:30.751 --> 01:38:32.490
<v Speaker 1>was an aneurysm prank and thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be funny.</v>

2206
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:37.491
<v Speaker 1>But then you started crying and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even give me your backpack when </v>

2207
01:38:37.491 --> 01:38:37.491
<v Speaker 1>she started crying member.</v>

2208
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:42.500
<v Speaker 1>We have to ask Ari how it ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I did his podcast a couple of </v>

2209
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 1>years ago and he told me you can't ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>red because red is hiding.</v>

2210
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

2211
01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play this for everybody </v>

2212
01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.071
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been playing rts a voicemail </v>

2213
01:38:52.071 --> 01:38:54.420
<v Speaker 1>message because when you call him up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says at the subscribers request,</v>

2214
01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:57.750
<v Speaker 1>incoming calls have been blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't paid his bill.</v>

2215
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2216
01:38:57.981 --> 01:38:59.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorrect.</v>

2217
01:38:59.410 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided to go rogue and he decided to</v>

2218
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:05.670
<v Speaker 1>go completely off the grid for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of months now.</v>

2219
01:39:06.230 --> 01:39:08.150
<v Speaker 1>He was in Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

2220
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And now apparently he's in some South </v>
<v Speaker 1>American company country.</v>

2221
01:39:11.731 --> 01:39:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

2222
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:16.950
<v Speaker 5>This phone does not accept incoming </v>
<v Speaker 5>calls.</v>

2223
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.780
<v Speaker 5>Message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See a one to seven.</v>

2224
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's normal.</v>

2225
01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:28.620
<v Speaker 1>That might mean that he's back state </v>
<v Speaker 1>side because last week it was in </v>

2226
01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you'd call him up,</v>

2227
01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.710
<v Speaker 1>it would be a Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't message them or anything.</v>

2228
01:39:32.770 --> 01:39:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2229
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 1>No email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No nothing.</v>

2230
01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

2231
01:39:37.691 --> 01:39:42.691
<v Speaker 1>What's this for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up and hung out with Henry </v>

2232
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:42.691
<v Speaker 1>rollins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

2233
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:43.800
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up and hung out with Henry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rollins,</v>

2234
01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Henry Rollins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is fucking crazy.</v>

2235
01:39:47.410 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of adderall and you know he's </v>

2236
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>not on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2237
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was he,</v>

2238
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:55.050
<v Speaker 1>he was on Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2239
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ritalin or know what it.</v>

2240
01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Was it Ritalin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on Ritalin when he was disagree.</v>

2241
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:02.500
<v Speaker 1>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was really young,</v>

2242
01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:06.460
<v Speaker 1>he was like a test subject from five to </v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

2243
01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:08.950
<v Speaker 1>His family put him on Ritalin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Doctors,</v>

2244
01:40:08.951 --> 01:40:09.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever it was.</v>

2245
01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:12.300
<v Speaker 1>That was heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he would be like all day,</v>

2246
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:17.110
<v Speaker 1>be like gritting his teeth and holy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after school was over,</v>

2247
01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

2248
01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:25.860
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he does is Henry rollins has the </v>

2249
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.640
<v Speaker 1>hardest time dealing with human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not being in motion.</v>

2250
01:40:27.670 --> 01:40:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Like he wrote this thing about how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into deep depression,</v>

2251
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:33.910
<v Speaker 1>like it comes to studying into his </v>
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>

2252
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Whenever he's not doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

2253
01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.750
<v Speaker 1>he can't chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to go to site.</v>

2254
01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I heard him on a podcast talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how his assistant makes up fake work for</v>

2255
01:40:43.541 --> 01:40:45.670
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for just to keep them busy,</v>

2256
01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:48.430
<v Speaker 1>like you have to drive out to this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pick up this thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Ari,</v>

2283

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Edinburgh fest and they started talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the podcast.</v>

2287
01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Amazing because Henry was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how he's been doing this.</v>

2288
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:09.990
<v Speaker 3>He's been to over 100 countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He travels all over the world and does </v>

2289
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.601
<v Speaker 3>it every year and he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes completely off the grid when he </v>

2290
01:42:12.601 --> 01:42:15.091
<v Speaker 3>does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just goes there and he brings his </v>

2291
01:42:15.091 --> 01:42:16.531
<v Speaker 3>laptop and his camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes pictures of people and people </v>

2292
01:42:16.531 --> 01:42:16.531
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing here?</v>

2293
01:42:16.531 --> 01:42:16.840
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here for to meet you man.</v>

2294
01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.960
<v Speaker 3>And it just meets people and goes places</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hangs out with better wins and goes </v>

2295
01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.401
<v Speaker 3>into the fucking desert and winds up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous places and dangerous </v>

2296
01:42:26.401 --> 01:42:30.871
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then comes back and has these </v>

2297
01:42:30.871 --> 01:42:30.871
<v Speaker 3>amazing stories from it.</v>

2298
01:42:30.871 --> 01:42:33.400
<v Speaker 3>So Ari just released his or just </v>
<v Speaker 3>recorded his latest,</v>

2299
01:42:33.401 --> 01:42:38.401
<v Speaker 3>our and had decided that he really needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something radical to generate new </v>

2300
01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:43.411
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had spent a month in China last year </v>

2301
01:42:43.411 --> 01:42:43.411
<v Speaker 3>and he came up with a bunch of material </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that.</v>

2302
01:42:43.411 --> 01:42:46.300
<v Speaker 3>So he decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna not talk to people.</v>

2303
01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to not talk to my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to talk to anybody.</v>

2304
01:42:49.031 --> 01:42:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to use my cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to live.</v>

2305
01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:54.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to go completely off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grid and travel the world.</v>

2306
01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.590
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2307

<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2313
01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.780

2314
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were so routinized at this point.</v>

2315

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:40.250
<v Speaker 2>it's due to a directive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that he's able to course </v>

<v Speaker 3>I put my fucking phone down.</v>

2333
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>There's another level of discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to just,</v>

2334
01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstain entirely.</v>

2335
01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:02.231
<v Speaker 1>Can you just do that every hour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put my phone in the other room and </v>

2336
01:44:02.231 --> 01:44:02.840
<v Speaker 1>then I go do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you have so much self control?</v>

2337
01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do,</v>

2338
01:44:06.570 --> 01:44:08.900
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a certain warrior to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do that,</v>

2339
01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes somebody has told me,</v>

2340
01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:16.150
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your phone down with my wife will </v>

<v Speaker 1>Totally not flawless.</v>

2394

<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a baby.</v>

2395
01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Aliens are twins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus I look at the smaller ones.</v>

2396
01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Look up to this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about this one?</v>

<v Speaker 2>This or that?</v>

2403
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Those are my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it harder to watch that like this?</v>

2409
01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Or is it hard to watch the deadline </v>
<v Speaker 2>deadline,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your whole approach to hunting is.</v>

2414
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I get it like you have a very honorable,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2416

<v Speaker 2>you treat on some level then with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dignity and into,</v>

2417
01:47:30.501 --> 01:47:31.980
<v Speaker 2>and you have integrity about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I do eat meat.</v>

2419
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had eating disorders so I can't </v>

2420
01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:40.050
<v Speaker 2>really like when I start restricting </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going,</v>

2421
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't need this.</v>

2422
01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can go down like a bad spiral.</v>

2423
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't actively like seek out meat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat pork really,</v>

2424
01:47:47.370 --> 01:47:50.430
<v Speaker 2>but I can't like start being too </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstemious pork.</v>

2425
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat pork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just I don't want to like you.</v>

2426
01:47:53.110 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 2>All of your listeners I think would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably think I'm very annoyed.</v>

2427
01:47:55.921 --> 01:47:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get a lot of like a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about that.</v>

2428
01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just once at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I've just too down the </v>

2429
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:06.321
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole of learning about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional document and capacity of pigs </v>

2430
01:48:06.321 --> 01:48:08.150
<v Speaker 2>and dogs that it's just kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bummer.</v>

2431
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart,</v>

2432
01:48:09.451 --> 01:48:10.410
<v Speaker 2>and very emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2433
01:48:10.411 --> 01:48:12.960
<v Speaker 2>they say they're like toddlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be around wild pigs.</v>

2434
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Wild pigs are monster feral tags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure yes,</v>

2435
01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:19.230
<v Speaker 2>but ones that are just raised and killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's also a lot of like,</v>

2436
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:21.390
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is too metaphysical or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2437
01:48:21.391 --> 01:48:24.930
<v Speaker 2>but like they know what's happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2438
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.960
<v Speaker 2>it's more like you're just eating fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so their adrenaline and cortisol just </v>

2439
01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:30.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2440
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:34.460
<v Speaker 2>throbs through their bodies while </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting killed and they just,</v>

2441
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:36.510
<v Speaker 2>they live in fear their entire lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

2442
01:48:36.511 --> 01:48:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you're ingesting that and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

2443
01:48:38.491 --> 01:48:43.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know what's fucked and the </v>

2444
01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:43.491
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics are crazy.</v>

2445
01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:44.460
<v Speaker 2>My Dad has antibiotic resistance right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2446
01:48:44.461 --> 01:48:49.461
<v Speaker 2>which I think is going to be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next sort of horrific things that we </v>

2447
01:48:49.461 --> 01:48:50.760
<v Speaker 2>can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where technology has sort of taken over.</v>

2448
01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's from doctors or from </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle?</v>

2449
01:48:52.831 --> 01:48:57.831
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely from doctors as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being over prescribed antibiotics every </v>

2450
01:48:57.831 --> 01:49:01.131
<v Speaker 2>time you have a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you have at this take </v>

2451
01:49:01.131 --> 01:49:01.131
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics and then by the time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually need them,</v>

2452
01:49:01.131 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 2>they don't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the situation my dad is</v>

2453
01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:02.220
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2454
01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:07.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a thing that they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>researching recently on Komodo dragons </v>

2455
01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.940
<v Speaker 3>and they're looking to Komodo dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's enzymes in their blood </v>

2456
01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:15.860
<v Speaker 3>that they think is going to be effective</v>
<v Speaker 3>in treating people that have resistance </v>

2457
01:49:16.411 --> 01:49:19.410
<v Speaker 3>to antibiotics for diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bananas.</v>

2458
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:20.820
<v Speaker 3>That was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was today.</v>

2459
01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I was reading that.</v>

2460
01:49:21.610 --> 01:49:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bananas and I also look.</v>

2461
01:49:24.161 --> 01:49:25.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2462
01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:27.970
<v Speaker 2>refer me and I'm not generalizing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

2463
01:49:27.971 --> 01:49:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

2464
01:49:28.691 --> 01:49:30.850
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things are projections and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2465
01:49:30.851 --> 01:49:35.851
<v Speaker 2>like when an animal is helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see myself as a helpless child and </v>

2466
01:49:35.851 --> 01:49:36.850
<v Speaker 2>when I see something in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the same way that like when you go</v>

2467
01:49:36.851 --> 01:49:38.560
<v Speaker 2>into a room of executives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2468
01:49:38.561 --> 01:49:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I see something in a cage,</v>

2469
01:49:40.481 --> 01:49:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I just something that's voiceless and </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpless.</v>

2470
01:49:42.761 --> 01:49:45.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what a kid is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just triggers like a lot of stuff.</v>

2471
01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't go to the pound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have 100,000</v>

2472
01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.720
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't do it.</v>

2473
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I do so much animal rescue and I send </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to go.</v>

2474
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:55.780
<v Speaker 2>When I see one that I'm going to rescue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go and get them for me because I'll</v>

2475
01:49:55.781 --> 01:49:56.730
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll lose my mind.</v>

2476
01:49:56.850 --> 01:49:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll take them all home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a horse.</v>

2477
01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I just got where it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.700
<v Speaker 2>So I'm Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm here today.</v>

2479
01:50:04.710 --> 01:50:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2480
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the ha ha.</v>

2481
01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2482
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:14.440
<v Speaker 2>he was a show horse who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dressage horse who,</v>

2483
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:19.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while they're just useless or </v>

2484
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.470
<v Speaker 2>like race horses kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2485
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:22.831
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going to be a put down and I do </v>

2486
01:50:22.831 --> 01:50:23.110
<v Speaker 2>equine therapy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's like,</v>

2487
01:50:23.111 --> 01:50:23.920
<v Speaker 2>do you want them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2488
01:50:23.921 --> 01:50:25.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my teacher.</v>

2489
01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:27.840
<v Speaker 2>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2490
01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I think you will find this interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it fascinating.</v>

2491
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm horses don't value anything that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>value money,</v>

2492
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.690
<v Speaker 2>prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clout,</v>

2493
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I MDB meter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

2494
01:50:40.101 --> 01:50:45.101
<v Speaker 2>they don't care about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that we use to defend </v>

2495
01:50:45.101 --> 01:50:45.101
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2496
01:50:45.101 --> 01:50:46.330
<v Speaker 2>being funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being smart,</v>

2497
01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:51.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing they care about is </v>

2498
01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:51.970
<v Speaker 2>authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>

2499
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:57.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horses serve kind of as mirrors to your </v>

2500
01:50:57.210 --> 01:50:57.640
<v Speaker 2>flaws and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inauthenticity.</v>

2501
01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're fake horse recognized,</v>

2502
01:51:00.131 --> 01:51:02.590
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're repelled by it.</v>

2503
01:51:02.591 --> 01:51:07.591
<v Speaker 2>So if you got a horse around with one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real housewives from Beverly Hills </v>

2504
01:51:07.591 --> 01:51:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and just kill it would kick us out from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the faith as what I.</v>

2505
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2506
01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:14.530
<v Speaker 2>so I mean there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

2507
01:51:14.531 --> 01:51:14.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2508
01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:18.040
<v Speaker 2>it's based on this philosophy called </v>
<v Speaker 2>being with horses by this German woman.</v>

2509
01:51:18.041 --> 01:51:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Her name is Sabine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember her last name,</v>

2510
01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:25.860
<v Speaker 2>but this place called the reflective </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse is where I keep it in Topanga </v>

2511
01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Canyon and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2512
01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:31.260
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapies used for a lot of people in </v>

2513
01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Rehab and sexual abuse victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2514
01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm working with this organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>called she heard power and Beth behrs </v>

2515
01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:39.721
<v Speaker 2>who I work with is I'm sort of running </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's letting because humans can </v>

2516
01:51:39.721 --> 01:51:43.060
<v Speaker 2>be so triggering for drug addicts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma survivors that,</v>

2517
01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:43.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2518
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:46.090
<v Speaker 2>therapy stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2519
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.000
<v Speaker 2>being able to work because I was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>triggered by therapists.</v>

2520
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I found myself lying to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find,</v>

2521
01:51:51.450 --> 01:51:56.040
<v Speaker 2>found myself like literally trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage their in like,</v>

2522
01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want them to think I was crazy.</v>

2523
01:51:58.450 --> 01:52:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the most awesome and crazy person</v>

2524
01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 2>at the same time I've ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like we all do the shit.</v>

2525
01:52:04.031 --> 01:52:05.500
<v Speaker 2>But then I was resentful because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2526
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking paying you and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say.</v>

2527
01:52:07.451 --> 01:52:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I was combative to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2528
01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2529
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 2>because it's like I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not selfish about my time,</v>

2530
01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:17.860
<v Speaker 2>but I have a healthy understanding about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a waste of time.</v>

2531
01:52:17.861 --> 01:52:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And I found a great therapist now who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bad ass and she's like,</v>

2532
01:52:21.190 --> 01:52:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's five,</v>

2533
01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:24.460
<v Speaker 2>two and whereas only mink coats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pajamas,</v>

2534
01:52:24.461 --> 01:52:26.390
<v Speaker 2>she's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2535
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like pho for like vests.</v>

2536
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2537
01:52:30.281 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 2>but then I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get very,</v>

2538
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:36.661
<v Speaker 2>like you and the executive room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would be in a therapist office </v>

2539
01:52:36.661 --> 01:52:36.661
<v Speaker 2>and it'd be like Harvard Business </v>
<v Speaker 2>School.</v>

2540
01:52:36.661 --> 01:52:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking guy doesn't know anything </v>

2541
01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:40.860
<v Speaker 2>about problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this guy.</v>

2542
01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get angry at them and then all of a </v>

2543
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:43.630
<v Speaker 2>sudden they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>authority figures to me.</v>

2544
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And that trigger it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like.</v>

2545
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:50.770
<v Speaker 2>And then I felt weird talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundary stuff or sexual stuff and I </v>

2546
01:52:50.770 --> 01:52:50.770
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2547
01:52:50.770 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the shame that comes with saying I </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched porn or this or that,</v>

2548
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:57.110
<v Speaker 2>like it just wasn't working for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then equine therapy,</v>

2549
01:52:57.111 --> 01:52:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2550
01:52:58.610 --> 01:53:01.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not about dominating the horse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it really illuminates,</v>

2551
01:53:01.730 --> 01:53:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our instinct to control and be perfect </v>

2552
01:53:06.730 --> 01:53:07.500
<v Speaker 2>and achieve and those are sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I'm working on right now.</v>

2553
01:53:07.501 --> 01:53:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have like crippling perfectionism</v>

2554
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:13.360
<v Speaker 2>where I feel like you and I have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

2555
01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:18.420
<v Speaker 2>but you're interesting because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the few people I know who's </v>

2556
01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:21.730
<v Speaker 2>incredibly successful but you don't seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a perfectionism issue like you </v>

2557
01:53:22.581 --> 01:53:25.790
<v Speaker 2>achieve a lot without an obsessed about </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieving.</v>

2558
01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a perfectionism issue and like </v>

2559
01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:32.540
<v Speaker 2>with writing this new our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've been texting about this,</v>

2560
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:37.541
<v Speaker 2>you're like doing a couple of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to come to this house and </v>

2561
01:53:37.541 --> 01:53:37.541
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes I do.</v>

2562
01:53:37.541 --> 01:53:37.541
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have a new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't get.</v>

2563
01:53:37.541 --> 01:53:39.430
<v Speaker 2>You only have to do whatever you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do at the ice house.</v>

2564
01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.120
<v Speaker 2>You can do 10 minutes or 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

2565
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:43.690
<v Speaker 2>if I don't do it perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2566
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:45.230
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2567
01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in my household I only got </v>

2568
01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:50.260
<v Speaker 2>rewarded for being perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no perfect in comedy,</v>

2569
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:51.290
<v Speaker 2>no such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2570
01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why,</v>

2571
01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:59.100
<v Speaker 2>like with horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to be perfect or </v>

2572
01:53:59.100 --> 01:53:59.100
<v Speaker 2>control the outcome and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>control a horse there,</v>

2573
01:53:59.230 --> 01:54:00.610
<v Speaker 2>the thousand pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2574
01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:01.330
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>

2575
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:02.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're alone with it in a ring,</v>

2576
01:54:02.811 --> 01:54:06.470
<v Speaker 2>not dominating it or controlling it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>using any kind of,</v>

2577
01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:09.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a manipulation devices,</v>

2578
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:14.450
<v Speaker 2>you really can only be authentic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>detach from the results of like,</v>

2579
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I need the horse to run and jump and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>

2580
01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:20.060
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to do what you in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind think is perfect.</v>

2581
01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's about like detaching from </v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

2582
01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Let me ease your concerns because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely have perfection issues.</v>

2583
01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:27.200
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just let them go.</v>

2584
01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2585
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't like anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do really almost nothing.</v>

2586
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't like any of my comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch anything I do because I </v>

2587
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:40.790
<v Speaker 2>break it down so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go over it so much.</v>

2588
01:54:40.791 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 2>You get sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make notes.</v>

2589
01:54:43.041 --> 01:54:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go over to change things.</v>

2590
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:49.530
<v Speaker 2>If we flub a word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to jump into an oncoming train.</v>

2591
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:51.170
<v Speaker 2>The audience loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2592
01:54:51.171 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 2>he's human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He flubs herds like,</v>

2593
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:54.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I recover it's fun,</v>

2594
01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:57.020
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2595
01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it bothers me when I don't do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2596
01:54:59.331 --> 01:55:04.331
<v Speaker 2>And he definitely bothers me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've learned how to manage that </v>

2597
01:55:04.331 --> 01:55:04.340
<v Speaker 2>bother over the years where it doesn't.</v>

2598
01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2599
01:55:06.230 --> 01:55:10.250
<v Speaker 2>and I think part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's a lot of factors</v>

2600
01:55:10.251 --> 01:55:12.290
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is understanding that it's an</v>

2601
01:55:12.291 --> 01:55:17.291
<v Speaker 2>issue and then figuring out why and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd spend a lot of time doing things </v>

2602
01:55:17.291 --> 01:55:21.911
<v Speaker 2>like meditating or taking a lot of yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do occasionally again in my isolation </v>

2603
01:55:24.531 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 2>tank and work things out in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I do yoga,</v>

2604
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat because I'm so like need to </v>

2605
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.950
<v Speaker 2>be doing it per like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2606
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it comes and goes,</v>

2607
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:36.760
<v Speaker 2>but it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when I'm,</v>

2608
01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm like get really busy and like out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>control and out of touch,</v>

2609
01:55:41.811 --> 01:55:46.811
<v Speaker 2>like I resort to my is what gets me </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and that's how I will survive </v>

2610
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:51.300
<v Speaker 2>very like primitive thinking because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what worked for me as a child.</v>

2611
01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you're all,</v>

2612
01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:57.000
<v Speaker 3>you're aware of all these issues which </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like step at least step one.</v>

2613
01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Well I think the real thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your proof that you can do it as </v>

2614
01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:05.521
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you release your protection </v>

2615
01:56:05.521 --> 01:56:07.170
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms or the things that worked for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or the things that.</v>

2616
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Because I think a lot of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectionism has worked in a lot of </v>

2617
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:15.271
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have achieved things and because of </v>

2618
01:56:15.271 --> 01:56:18.811
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has started to actually hold me </v>

2619
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:18.811
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you,</v>

2620
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of maladaptive behavior that </v>

2621
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:24.710
<v Speaker 2>has worked for you professionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you release it and still will you,</v>

2622
01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.240
<v Speaker 2>you are also,</v>

2623
01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:28.020
<v Speaker 3>you're single and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2624
01:56:28.150 --> 01:56:33.150
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not finding people that are </v>

2625
01:56:33.150 --> 01:56:33.150
<v Speaker 3>competitive.</v>

2626
01:56:33.150 --> 01:56:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I love that you just said that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm finding it was bleeding into my </v>

2627
01:56:36.210 --> 01:56:36.820
<v Speaker 2>dating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2628
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:39.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2629
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of dating as being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go like,</v>

2630
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're flawed.</v>

2631
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop picking you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>

2632
01:56:45.451 --> 01:56:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Because I think there's an overachiever </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality that sometimes bleeds into our</v>

2633
01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 2>personal life of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if there's someone better?</v>

2634
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't feel safe to,</v>

2635
01:56:52.161 --> 01:56:57.161
<v Speaker 3>you also have predatory instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you find that were week thing and </v>

2636
01:56:57.161 --> 01:56:57.161
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2637
01:56:57.161 --> 01:56:57.560
<v Speaker 3>And Scott got a wimp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2638
01:56:57.561 --> 01:56:59.020
<v Speaker 3>he's got a mental limp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2639
01:56:59.021 --> 01:57:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>

2640
01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:05.050
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might be full of shit or he might be </v>

2641
01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:05.050
<v Speaker 3>pretending he's something he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or he might be.</v>

2642
01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2643
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:06.790
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

2644
01:57:06.791 --> 01:57:08.580
<v Speaker 2>that's so am I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

2645
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>

2646
01:57:09.631 --> 01:57:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2647
01:57:10.471 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 2>at what point do you just commit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept like,</v>

2648
01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and I don't,</v>

2649
01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer.</v>

2650
01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be hard to find someone </v>

2651
01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:21.860
<v Speaker 3>who can keep up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be a big part.</v>

2652
01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2653
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:30.270
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent in love that it has </v>

2654
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.370
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that going to be exact?</v>

2655
01:57:30.371 --> 01:57:35.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've dated guys that are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>high functioning Alpha type a's and it </v>

2656
01:57:35.441 --> 01:57:36.070
<v Speaker 2>was exhausting.</v>

2657
01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Well that doesn't necessarily have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausting.</v>

2658
01:57:39.111 --> 01:57:42.010
<v Speaker 3>You just have to find someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>known knows that look,</v>

2659
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:47.050
<v Speaker 3>you can have a car that's 600 horsepower</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not know what the fuck to do with </v>

2660
01:57:47.050 --> 01:57:51.251
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're going sideways around every </v>

2661
01:57:51.251 --> 01:57:51.500
<v Speaker 3>corner just because you have all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and all that energy.</v>

2662
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:53.420
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you're utilizing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

2663
01:57:53.630 --> 01:57:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Or You could have a car that has 600 </v>
<v Speaker 3>horsepower and you take every corner </v>

2664
01:57:58.630 --> 01:58:02.681
<v Speaker 3>perfectly and you know when it hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gas and it's always there when you need </v>

2665
01:58:02.681 --> 01:58:02.681
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't use it.</v>

2666
01:58:02.681 --> 01:58:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just chill.</v>

2667
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2668
01:58:04.851 --> 01:58:05.630
<v Speaker 3>I figured it out.</v>

2669
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:08.900
<v Speaker 2>How did you know that you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna commit to this person?</v>

2670
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:10.700
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2671
01:58:10.730 --> 01:58:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Or like any day now.</v>

2672
01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2673
01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I just got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to feel,</v>

2674
01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:23.220
<v Speaker 3>feel safe with the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel calm when the person enjoy being </v>

2675
01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:23.220
<v Speaker 3>around them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2676
01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:25.070
<v Speaker 3>And there the other thing is a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you or me or anyways,</v>

2677
01:58:25.071 --> 01:58:28.660
<v Speaker 3>so you have a lot of options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an issue too because if you don't</v>

2678
01:58:28.661 --> 01:58:29.920
<v Speaker 3>have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live in a small town,</v>

2679
01:58:29.921 --> 01:58:31.830
<v Speaker 3>it's only a few people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find someone quickly,</v>

2680
01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:32.610
<v Speaker 3>musical chairs.</v>

2681
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:35.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2682
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you have a lot of options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2683
01:58:37.391 --> 01:58:39.280
<v Speaker 3>well this guy is just not quite doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the farming.</v>

2684
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Let me just fucking go test the waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're out</v>

2685
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.050
<v Speaker 1>there checking your dating app and who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you throw your phone in your home.</v>

2686
01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:48.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also like I see,</v>

2687
01:58:48.210 --> 01:58:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a generalization,</v>

2688
01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:50.770
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people that I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

2689
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the most of being the most </v>

2690
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:59.431
<v Speaker 1>effective in life do have calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable home lives or healthy.</v>

2691
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:04.180
<v Speaker 1>If you were going out every night to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston's,</v>

2692
01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:05.140
<v Speaker 1>what's Wednesday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2693
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like a glove in La at Winston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

2694
01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:09.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2695
01:59:09.971 --> 01:59:13.270
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to Maggio is little </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy at the grove every night trying to</v>

2696
01:59:13.271 --> 01:59:18.271
<v Speaker 1>pick up girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have no time to build an </v>

2697
01:59:18.271 --> 01:59:18.271
<v Speaker 1>empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no time to work.</v>

2698
01:59:19.130 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2699
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:23.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a debt is a real issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to settle.</v>

2700
01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the market to compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you'll probably find someone </v>

2701
01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are you really willing to compromise</v>

2702
01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:35.530
<v Speaker 1>or you just saying that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once there's a guy there and he's flawed</v>

2703
01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:38.660
<v Speaker 1>and you think about guys that you used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to date that weren't flawed.</v>

2704
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to not view objectify </v>

2705
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 1>people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm flawed too.</v>

2706
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Like where do I get off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all flawed for sure.</v>

2707
01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I also think like there's this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this and I don't know if it's </v>

2708
01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.300
<v Speaker 1>that feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we can leave that out of it,</v>

2709
01:59:55.301 --> 01:59:57.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's this new trend where women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2710
01:59:57.851 --> 02:00:00.040
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them who are like,</v>

2711
02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I deserve better than this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2712
02:00:03.070 --> 02:00:03.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

2713
02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:07.370
<v Speaker 1>You're a b minus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deserve a b minus.</v>

2714
02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm like,</v>

2715
02:00:09.850 --> 02:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I deserve this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2716
02:00:11.411 --> 02:00:12.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

2717
02:00:12.641 --> 02:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I deserve someone who's kind of a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could certainly get lucky.</v>

2718
02:00:17.081 --> 02:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I think I definitely got lucky with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

2719
02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>She's a really nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's smart,</v>

2720
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>she's calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very patient.</v>

2721
02:00:22.931 --> 02:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Must be easy to get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>

2722
02:00:25.541 --> 02:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>and this is the first time I've thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>

2723
02:00:27.161 --> 02:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe not about who that person is.</v>

2724
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:31.900
<v Speaker 1>It's about who I am with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the everything.</v>

2725
02:00:31.901 --> 02:00:36.901
<v Speaker 1>That's everything because you who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like we were talking about this </v>

2726
02:00:36.901 --> 02:00:40.141
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're around people that are </v>

2727
02:00:40.141 --> 02:00:40.690
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit bleeds off into your brain and when</v>

2728
02:00:40.691 --> 02:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>you're around people that are nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel nicer.</v>

2729
02:00:43.290 --> 02:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Who are you around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2730
02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you're calm and you're Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be this guy all the time,</v>

2731
02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part I am.</v>

2732
02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to go home and work </v>
<v Speaker 1>though some hammered or you drink </v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't get to do that.</v>

2749
02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It's grooming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were monkeys were monkeys with guns?</v>

2750
02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>We're just monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this last time that um,</v>

2751
02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bonobo apes and humans have more </v>

2752
02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>similar DNA than African elephants in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian elephants.</v>

2753
02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>No Apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>

2754
02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:04.211
<v Speaker 1>They're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have one restriction sexually the </v>

2755
02:02:04.211 --> 02:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>mother won't have sex with the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2756
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Women who have sex with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men have sex with men.</v>

2757
02:02:10.530 --> 02:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That's like a good genetic sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival instinct because doesn't that </v>

2758
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>incest is breeds with the dad fucks his </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters.</v>

2759
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not fair.</v>

2760
02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rude.</v>

2761
02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>That like a freaking equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is A.</v>

2762
02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I might not be pronouncing this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gyn ocracy like apparently they call </v>

2763
02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>it a Gyn ocracy because they use their </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaginas to get what they want is power.</v>

2764
02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.490
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2765
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people humans do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating that they're the least</v>

2766
02:02:36.531 --> 02:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>violent champion the month that has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most sex.</v>

2767
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By far.</v>

2768
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2769
02:02:41.031 --> 02:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's another way to get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression out.</v>

2770
02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:45.830
<v Speaker 1>That's been sort of our theme today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2771
02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about this whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately when I examine human culture and </v>

2772
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:55.091
<v Speaker 1>civilization and all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocities that we commit on a daily </v>

2773
02:02:55.091 --> 02:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I look back at,</v>

2774
02:02:55.690 --> 02:03:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this piece about ancient </v>

2775
02:03:00.690 --> 02:03:01.310
<v Speaker 1>man and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trials and tribulations,</v>

2776
02:03:01.311 --> 02:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>neanderthals and Homo sapiens how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

2777
02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between Neanderthal in Cro </v>

2778
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Magnon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

2779
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I always get this wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cro-Magnon is the early version of us.</v>

2780
02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:20.040
<v Speaker 1>The tall is a different different breed </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human neanderthal.</v>

2781
02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.110
<v Speaker 1>We're humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2782
02:03:21.111 --> 02:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I conflate them all the time and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2783
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:24.210
<v Speaker 1>now I understand that.</v>

2784
02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I think cro magnon is not us though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's not homo sapiens.</v>

2785
02:03:29.991 --> 02:03:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always like Australia.</v>

2786
02:03:32.241 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Pythagoreous I think was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

2787
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the first human like creature honor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the dumbest person on your podcast.</v>

2788
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely never done clearly.</v>

2789
02:03:42.111 --> 02:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>You've never met Brian Red band </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeleton.</v>

2790
02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Say Brian Gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a unliked neanderthals,</v>

2791
02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:49.160
<v Speaker 1>cro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnon and not a separate species.</v>

2792
02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the earliest known European </v>

2793
02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>example of our species living between </v>
<v Speaker 1>$35,000</v>

2794
02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:56.030
<v Speaker 1>and 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2795
02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten thousand years ago is nothing.</v>

2796
02:03:59.090 --> 02:04:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2797
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:02.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a second.</v>

2798
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And then actually modern in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomical way.</v>

2799
02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys learned something in a.</v>

2800
02:04:08.301 --> 02:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

2801
02:04:09.471 --> 02:04:12.140
<v Speaker 1>years is so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the craziest thing.</v>

2802
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:15.110
<v Speaker 1>They only existed 175,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2803
02:04:15.111 --> 02:04:17.450
<v Speaker 1>The emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 175,000</v>

2804
02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans emerged.</v>

2805
02:04:18.441 --> 02:04:20.630
<v Speaker 1>So before 175,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2806
02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>which is a blink in time roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really know the,</v>

2807
02:04:24.250 --> 02:04:24.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2808
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changes there,</v>

2809
02:04:26.691 --> 02:04:28.670
<v Speaker 1>their estimate changes based on fossil </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

2810
02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:31.160
<v Speaker 1>But that's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recently,</v>

2811
02:04:31.610 --> 02:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>what I was thinking is when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at are our issues,</v>

2812
02:04:34.821 --> 02:04:39.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dating and love and friendship and </v>

2813
02:04:39.821 --> 02:04:39.821
<v Speaker 1>creativity</v>

2814
02:04:39.821 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 3>and ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these weird issues that human beings</v>

2815
02:04:42.001 --> 02:04:42.840
<v Speaker 3>have today in this</v>

2816
02:04:43.190 --> 02:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and weirdly luxurious world problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

2817
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:50.530
<v Speaker 2>That's like 100 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2818
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

2819
02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:55.220
<v Speaker 3>is the future going to be like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2820
02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.630
<v Speaker 3>What is a modern human in the year 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 75</v>

2821
02:05:01.130 --> 02:05:02.830
<v Speaker 2>going to be Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2822
02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't we all just going to be in our </v>

2823
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality machines just </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating and.</v>

2824
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be the last people to touch our</v>

2825
02:05:09.451 --> 02:05:14.451
<v Speaker 3>genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably this will be the last pussy </v>

2826
02:05:14.451 --> 02:05:14.451
<v Speaker 3>spanking generation.</v>

2827
02:05:14.451 --> 02:05:14.451
<v Speaker 2>The last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the last few.</v>

2828
02:05:14.451 --> 02:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe sex will be fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a book called,</v>

2829
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to circle back to porn again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a book called porn nation </v>

2830
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 2>and in it there was a statistic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>said 80 percent of kids under 18 boys </v>

2831
02:05:27.791 --> 02:05:30.520
<v Speaker 2>would rather watch porn than have sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an actual woman.</v>

2832
02:05:32.370 --> 02:05:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Wrong fact check it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focus groups,</v>

2833
02:05:35.130 --> 02:05:38.920
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a very specific group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who would agree to be interviewed</v>

2834
02:05:38.921 --> 02:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>about whatever the same assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think women have to masturbate in tubs</v>

2835
02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:46.780
<v Speaker 2>only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Kid.</v>

2836
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:48.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean who knows?</v>

2837
02:05:48.971 --> 02:05:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could fake fake boobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news.</v>

2838
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could probably prefer because you're</v>

2839
02:05:54.161 --> 02:05:56.170
<v Speaker 2>in control of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a vr woman who's going to do</v>

2840
02:05:56.171 --> 02:06:01.171
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to deal with her </v>

2841
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:01.171
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and like talk about like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we?</v>

2842
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:02.620
<v Speaker 2>But that's half the thrill you have to.</v>

2843
02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:07.330
<v Speaker 2>But you didn't grow up on fake women and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anna May.</v>

2844
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerking off to cartoons.</v>

2845
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:16.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we watched Saturday morning </v>

2846
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:20.671
<v Speaker 2>cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are jerking off to animate and </v>

2847
02:06:20.671 --> 02:06:20.671
<v Speaker 2>white men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2848
02:06:20.671 --> 02:06:21.580
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

2849
02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:23.490
<v Speaker 2>how many of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are jerking.</v>

2850
02:06:24.570 --> 02:06:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Will you look up in an animated like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people are poor?</v>

2851
02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a very small number by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

2852
02:06:32.561 --> 02:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the women in real porn or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifeless than the animated important,</v>

2853
02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're weird now because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't fake ass as well.</v>

2854
02:06:40.541 --> 02:06:45.541
<v Speaker 2>It's like John beaudry yards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like theory of like simulacrum about </v>

2855
02:06:45.541 --> 02:06:49.111
<v Speaker 2>like how we prefer this simulation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to the original of something </v>

2856
02:06:49.111 --> 02:06:53.910
<v Speaker 2>when we can actually control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Andy Warhol was onto that as </v>

2857
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2858
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't it bizarre that some men </v>
<v Speaker 3>prefer fake boobs?</v>

2859
02:06:56.050 --> 02:06:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Like they get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2860
02:06:57.601 --> 02:06:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Donald?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2861
02:06:58.381 --> 02:07:03.381
<v Speaker 3>Getting off to anime porn is shorthand </v>
<v Speaker 3>for supporting Donald Trump connection.</v>

2862
02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Lorin griset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to say the name or Sydney or Sydney.</v>

2863
02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this just happened to pop up,</v>

2864
02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 3>but what a bizarre fucking title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2865
02:07:13.021 --> 02:07:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what she has to say.</v>

2866
02:07:14.590 --> 02:07:17.660
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forbes continue to push forward.</v>

2867
02:07:17.661 --> 02:07:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious.</v>

2868
02:07:18.751 --> 02:07:22.950
<v Speaker 3>On Tuesday evening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gop consultant Rick Wilson made twitter,</v>

2869
02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:24.960
<v Speaker 3>but to do waves with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

2870
02:07:24.961 --> 02:07:26.880
<v Speaker 3>They have the fucking stock of twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2871
02:07:26.881 --> 02:07:29.670
<v Speaker 3>They're single men plus zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent,</v>

2872
02:07:29.671 --> 02:07:34.671
<v Speaker 3>zero point 50 percent in that hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They showed twitter and then they have </v>

2873
02:07:34.671 --> 02:07:35.400
<v Speaker 3>people reading Forbes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we'll just stock at</v>

2874
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:38.700
<v Speaker 2>the stock number right next to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

2875
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:43.830
<v Speaker 3>So weird waves with his claim that </v>
<v Speaker 3>donald trump's supporters are mostly </v>

2876
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:47.601
<v Speaker 3>single men who masturbate to way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at glp consultant too.</v>

2877
02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I think they're right with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>unintentionally incendiary statement </v>

2878
02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:58.620
<v Speaker 3>that Wilson says he made directly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>troll trump's followers.</v>

2879
02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:01.530
<v Speaker 3>February's trolling everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2880
02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:04.620
<v Speaker 3>as any enemy fan will let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called,</v>

2881
02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:06.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clears throat.</v>

2882
02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Hentai a specific genre of x ray to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese animated cartoons.</v>

2883
02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:14.820
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting is that in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to intentionally make people angry,</v>

2884
02:08:14.821 --> 02:08:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Wilson targeted anime Geeks as his </v>
<v Speaker 3>insults.</v>

2885
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2886
02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.340
<v Speaker 2>It's tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't upset them.</v>

2887
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can compete with I,</v>

2892
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't compete with cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2896
02:08:41.541 --> 02:08:43.400

<v Speaker 2>If you're paying for cartoon port,</v>

2897
02:08:43.401 --> 02:08:45.180

2901
02:08:57.021 --> 02:08:59.460
<v Speaker 3>likely to search for anime than older </v>
<v Speaker 3>browsers.</v>

2941
02:10:35.970 --> 02:10:35.970
<v Speaker 2>categories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians way down</v>

2942
02:10:35.970 --> 02:10:39.100
<v Speaker 1>low people are way more into Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are specifically Japanese.</v>

2943
02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get like Vietnamese,</v>

2944
02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Thai and people are like,</v>

2950
02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:54.770

2951
02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:58.430
<v Speaker 1>to be misconstrued as not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be worried about that.</v>

2952
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.940
<v Speaker 1>This is the age we live in.</v>

2958
02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>going to be classier than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's something socio lineals </v>

2959
02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>search term differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

02:16:54.371 --> 02:16:55.250
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3078
02:16:55.630 --> 02:17:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently she did some interview about </v>

3079
02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:00.630
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

3080
02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sort of embracing my inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>slut.</v>

3081
02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

3082
02:17:03.461 --> 02:17:08.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come like guys are allowed to do </v>

3083
02:17:08.461 --> 02:17:08.461
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3084
02:17:08.461 --> 02:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I have parents and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't put it on.</v>

3085
02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the Paris.</v>

3086
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Anything different there or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

3087
02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't have parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to punish you or maybe some,</v>

3088
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:19.960
<v Speaker 1>some women have parents that they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to punish,</v>

3089
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:25.150
<v Speaker 1>want their dad who doesn't talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever to see this and realize how bad he </v>

3090
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:25.710
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3091
02:17:25.810 --> 02:17:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3092
02:17:26.521 --> 02:17:30.610
<v Speaker 1>It could be an inactive aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3093
02:17:30.611 --> 02:17:32.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>

3094
02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:32.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3095
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>punished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get revenge on and I still don't have </v>

3096
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>sex on camera and upload it to Vimeo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3097
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.840
<v Speaker 1>because that's also self punishment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways.</v>

3098
02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:43.330
<v Speaker 1>You're setting yourself up to massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of.</v>

3099
02:17:43.390 --> 02:17:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3100
02:17:44.531 --> 02:17:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went just for no good reason.</v>

3101
02:17:47.171 --> 02:17:52.171
<v Speaker 1>I went to Ronda Rousey's instagram page </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day because she showed up in my </v>

3102
02:17:52.171 --> 02:17:52.240
<v Speaker 1>feed.</v>

3103
02:17:52.570 --> 02:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I went to her page and I looked at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the comments on some of her pictures </v>

3104
02:17:58.091 --> 02:18:03.091
<v Speaker 1>in the Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other monsters out there about sexual </v>

3105
02:18:03.091 --> 02:18:03.091
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3106
02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some of it was sexual.</v>

3107
02:18:05.051 --> 02:18:07.570
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was just mean like you</v>

3108
02:18:07.571 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 1>open yourself up to just being fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3109
02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3110
02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:16.930
<v Speaker 1>like she I'm sure is doesn't look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that or something,</v>

3111
02:18:16.931 --> 02:18:19.980
<v Speaker 1>but whenever I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out for a couple days.</v>

3112
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't look at it.</v>

3113
02:18:21.031 --> 02:18:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they have to keep Donald </v>

3114
02:18:26.031 --> 02:18:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Trump away from twitter and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram and the television because </v>

3115
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.910
<v Speaker 1>there was some thing that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about some,</v>

3116
02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.270
<v Speaker 1>some campaign aid that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3117
02:18:31.271 --> 02:18:33.250
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to keep him away.</v>

3118
02:18:33.251 --> 02:18:38.251
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep them distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to keep them away from the </v>

3119
02:18:38.251 --> 02:18:40.141
<v Speaker 1>television because he becomes fixated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just wants to talk about like </v>

3120
02:18:40.141 --> 02:18:41.110
<v Speaker 1>someone who's doing a Saturday night </v>
<v Speaker 1>live sketch about them.</v>

3121
02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3122
02:18:41.891 --> 02:18:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3123
02:18:42.581 --> 02:18:47.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about politics to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really talk about it and it really </v>

3124
02:18:47.581 --> 02:18:48.790
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are interested,</v>

3125
02:18:48.791 --> 02:18:53.791
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like he shows the signs of a </v>

3126
02:18:53.791 --> 02:18:54.220
<v Speaker 1>clinical narcissist and whether that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good or bad.</v>

3127
02:18:54.221 --> 02:18:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe presidents should be narcissists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe athletes.</v>

3128
02:18:56.510 --> 02:19:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where that benefits you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are careers where it </v>

3129
02:19:01.510 --> 02:19:04.261
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but narcissists have that kind of </v>

3130
02:19:04.261 --> 02:19:07.141
<v Speaker 1>addiction theory is scary for a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense for an artist or for an </v>

3131
02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:11.260
<v Speaker 1>athlete that you have to have some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of narcissism to become j.</v>

3132
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Lo to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just say I'm the best in the world </v>

3133
02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:17.110
<v Speaker 1>to be a diva or to be a whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you are.</v>

3134
02:19:17.650 --> 02:19:22.650
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a real scary thing when it's </v>

3135
02:19:22.650 --> 02:19:22.650
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

3136
02:19:22.650 --> 02:19:23.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about Kanye West,</v>

3137
02:19:23.951 --> 02:19:26.920
<v Speaker 1>when Kanye West did that thing in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this giant concert and he said,</v>

3138
02:19:26.921 --> 02:19:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I did vote I would vote.</v>

3139
02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vote on trump,</v>

3140
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:34.190
<v Speaker 1>which just didn't seem like it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have a vote on trump.</v>

3141
02:19:34.191 --> 02:19:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3142
02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Thank God you don't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But helping.</v>

3143
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Well it is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was gonna say is he did this </v>

3144
02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:48.911
<v Speaker 1>thing where he's talking about it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of this gigantic group of people </v>

3145
02:19:48.911 --> 02:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>where he's talking about he loves trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves.</v>

3146
02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I love Kanye because Kanye loves trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about himself in </v>

3147
02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:58.090
<v Speaker 1>third person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so disturbing and it's like this </v>

3148
02:19:58.090 --> 02:20:00.230
<v Speaker 1>is such a weird way of addressing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying in a gracious way.</v>

3149
02:20:00.231 --> 02:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>That was very kind of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate him.</v>

3150
02:20:02.181 --> 02:20:05.060
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant artist and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to have a support.</v>

3151
02:20:05.061 --> 02:20:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye.</v>

3152
02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just saying that he loves </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

3153
02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Well he loved what I love Kanye because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye live.</v>

3154
02:20:09.870 --> 02:20:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves trump.</v>

3155
02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Like he kept saying it and repeating.</v>

3156
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It broke like an Asian person speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken English.</v>

3157
02:20:16.821 --> 02:20:21.821
<v Speaker 1>He's also a 70 year old grandpa who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there working 150 hours a day and </v>

3158
02:20:21.891 --> 02:20:25.100
<v Speaker 1>he's probably ragged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your thing about impulse control,</v>

3159
02:20:25.290 --> 02:20:27.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you can't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to send that.</v>

3160
02:20:28.450 --> 02:20:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put a pin in that and spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>some time critical thinking before I </v>

3161
02:20:33.450 --> 02:20:37.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is also a man who did you hear </v>

3162
02:20:37.810 --> 02:20:37.810
<v Speaker 1>what he said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3163
02:20:37.810 --> 02:20:38.510
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3164
02:20:38.511 --> 02:20:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see things from every angle.</v>

3165
02:20:40.641 --> 02:20:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing impressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3166
02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I can see things from every angle </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably better than anyone.</v>

3167
02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3168
02:20:45.441 --> 02:20:48.900
<v Speaker 1>he always does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone you know.</v>

3169
02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:52.550
<v Speaker 1>But I'm fascinated by how much a mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness can help you.</v>

3170
02:20:52.551 --> 02:20:54.290
<v Speaker 1>And then when it starts to backfire on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3171
02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously worked pretty well on </v>

3172
02:20:59.330 --> 02:20:59.330
<v Speaker 1>some level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3173
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:00.620
<v Speaker 1>what's going on now is his mental state </v>
<v Speaker 1>or his,</v>

3174
02:21:00.621 --> 02:21:03.920
<v Speaker 1>the way he behaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his personality is being examined by the</v>

3175
02:21:03.921 --> 02:21:08.450
<v Speaker 1>brightest minds in the world in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal about us.</v>

3176
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Other people that are the dumbest </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiots.</v>

3177
02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about comics and gagging </v>
<v Speaker 1>for watching,</v>

3178
02:21:16.071 --> 02:21:18.830
<v Speaker 1>zip popping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

3179
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's under this.</v>

3180
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:25.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a level of scrutiny that you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a rapper like Kanye west or a </v>

3181
02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:29.510
<v Speaker 1>fighter like Rhonda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this whole nother level</v>

3182
02:21:29.511 --> 02:21:34.511
<v Speaker 1>when you want to be the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire nuclear armament for the United </v>

3183
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:41.110
<v Speaker 1>States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the commander in chief </v>

3184
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.110
<v Speaker 1>for the greatest country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world has ever known and that's what</v>

3185
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done.</v>

3186
02:21:41.290 --> 02:21:43.040
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it's good.</v>

3187
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it's was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and I think Howard knows him pretty</v>

3188
02:21:47.391 --> 02:21:52.391
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was very astute what he was </v>

3189
02:21:52.391 --> 02:21:52.391
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not good for him.</v>

3190
02:21:52.391 --> 02:21:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Like mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the guy wants to be loved and </v>

3191
02:21:56.650 --> 02:21:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you're just not going to be loved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that job.</v>

3192
02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets loved.</v>

3193
02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it to get love and you're </v>

3194
02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>getting the massive amount of hate come </v>
<v Speaker 1>at you.</v>

3195
02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:04.300
<v Speaker 1>But he is getting love from a specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

3196
02:22:04.310 --> 02:22:09.310
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm again fascinated by the </v>

3197
02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:09.310
<v Speaker 1>primal element of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how we,</v>

3198
02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people are who are responding well </v>

3199
02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 1>to what he's doing are responding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha and we have a,</v>

3200
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I think reptilian attraction to Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>males.</v>

3201
02:22:18.141 --> 02:22:23.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it when I was watching him in </v>

3202
02:22:23.141 --> 02:22:25.240
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early on and that in the early debates </v>

3203
02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:25.240
<v Speaker 1>when there was like six candidates on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

3204
02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>as much as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I did his</v>

3205
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.240
<v Speaker 2>roast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him.</v>

3206
02:22:27.241 --> 02:22:28.620
<v Speaker 2>He was gross to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3207
02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:30.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh he's,</v>

3208
02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:35.300
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy who puts his hand on your </v>

3209
02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:35.300
<v Speaker 2>lower back when he talks to you for no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason at all.</v>

3210
02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3211
02:22:36.721 --> 02:22:38.490
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a car.</v>

3212
02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Was a cartoon character of Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3213
02:22:40.981 --> 02:22:43.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's the earth dots version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

3214
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so surreal at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3215
02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:50.640
<v Speaker 2>but I saw him sort of knowing all of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortcomings this before anyone actually</v>

3216
02:22:50.641 --> 02:22:52.860
<v Speaker 2>thought he would become president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3217
02:22:52.861 --> 02:22:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that the other candidates didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have shortcomings,</v>

3218
02:22:55.740 --> 02:23:00.740
<v Speaker 2>but he said to all of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pointed them all out and he was like,</v>

3219
02:23:00.781 --> 02:23:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you've asked me for money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've asked me for money.</v>

3220
02:23:03.061 --> 02:23:07.620
<v Speaker 2>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was so ballsy and courageous.</v>

3221
02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:09.860
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my primal brain was like,</v>

3222
02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:10.990
<v Speaker 2>if there's an earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3223
02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm going with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all in such a survivalist </v>

3224
02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.080
<v Speaker 2>mindset with what's happened with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy and people are struggling for.</v>

3225
02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3226
02:23:19.410 --> 02:23:20.520
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

3227
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:23.220
<v Speaker 2>that guy's the most fearless </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker have the budge.</v>

3228
02:23:23.221 --> 02:23:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is so calculated and scared </v>
<v Speaker 2>and reserved.</v>

3229
02:23:26.490 --> 02:23:28.100
<v Speaker 3>They weren't prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3230
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think politics in general was </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared for someone with that mindset.</v>

3231
02:23:31.351 --> 02:23:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Someone who can rebound from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab the pussy thing and be like,</v>

3232
02:23:34.891 --> 02:23:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it was locker room talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't care.</v>

3233
02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.610
<v Speaker 3>If he apologized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would have been pissed.</v>

3234
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at least to support this would've</v>

3235
02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:41.270
<v Speaker 2>been pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't apologize.</v>

3236
02:23:41.271 --> 02:23:41.990
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it.</v>

3237
02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:44.840
<v Speaker 2>There's something in our primal brains </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

3238
02:23:44.841 --> 02:23:49.841
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy can protect me when shit goes </v>

3239
02:23:49.841 --> 02:23:49.841
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3240
02:23:49.841 --> 02:23:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Well there's also like people are tired </v>
<v Speaker 3>of really ultra left wing nanny state </v>

3241
02:23:54.961 --> 02:23:59.961
<v Speaker 3>type people to want to tell you what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can say and what you can say to behave </v>

3242
02:23:59.961 --> 02:24:01.290
<v Speaker 3>and totally trigger word</v>

3243
02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:04.080
<v Speaker 2>and you're so good at like you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to this problem.</v>

3244
02:24:04.081 --> 02:24:09.081
<v Speaker 2>You're part of this solution of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also like we were </v>

3245
02:24:09.081 --> 02:24:09.090
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier with Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools in the pendulum swinging of this</v>

3246
02:24:09.091 --> 02:24:13.280
<v Speaker 2>like hyper political correctness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just this reaction of like,</v>

3247
02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:18.290
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker does not care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying Muslims are bad and they're </v>

3248
02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:21.710
<v Speaker 2>raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like he's saying what our crazy </v>

3249
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.710
<v Speaker 2>uncle says at dinner every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3250
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and like there's just something brave</v>

3251
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:28.270
<v Speaker 3>about it that's attractive to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is hope that someone is </v>

3252
02:24:28.270 --> 02:24:32.621
<v Speaker 3>going to recognize the positive elements</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that kind of not total disregard for </v>

3253
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:35.990
<v Speaker 3>the way people view him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3254
02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:41.290
<v Speaker 3>but having the confidence to be yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then meeting much closer to the </v>

3255
02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:47.080
<v Speaker 3>middle in terms of being compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind and being open minded and </v>

3256
02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:48.620
<v Speaker 3>instead of apologetic and weekend scare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3257
02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Be both.</v>

3258
02:24:49.970 --> 02:24:54.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other part of the Democratic </v>

3259
02:24:54.970 --> 02:24:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Party is showing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3260
02:24:54.970 --> 02:24:59.520
<v Speaker 2>a lack of people who are unapologetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fearless and um,</v>

3261
02:25:01.430 --> 02:25:02.420
<v Speaker 2>have a plum.</v>

3262
02:25:03.050 --> 02:25:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This also,</v>

3263
02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:09.370
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting watching people that </v>

3264
02:25:09.370 --> 02:25:09.680
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to assign a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>cabinet positions backing out.</v>

3265
02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:10.670
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

3266
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:15.920
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No amount of money can deal with the </v>

3267
02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:16.880
<v Speaker 3>hate frats and the pussy hats out my </v>
<v Speaker 3>front door.</v>

3268
02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:21.680
<v Speaker 3>It's so detrimental to your career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they think the boat is sinking,</v>

3269
02:25:21.681 --> 02:25:22.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3270
02:25:22.041 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 3>this might make it the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3271
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I could also just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3272
02:25:26.681 --> 02:25:28.600
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating time,</v>

3273
02:25:28.601 --> 02:25:33.601
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explore the kind of things that you </v>

3274
02:25:33.601 --> 02:25:33.601
<v Speaker 2>explore in your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is human nature and our primordial</v>

3275
02:25:33.601 --> 02:25:35.260
<v Speaker 2>instincts because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been,</v>

3276
02:25:35.261 --> 02:25:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most tribal primal thing I've,</v>

3277
02:25:38.290 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I've witnessed in my lifetime.</v>

3278
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen so much separation </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the left and the right and the,</v>

3279
02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:46.090
<v Speaker 3>the anger and fury that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

3280
02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:49.330
<v Speaker 2>A great article in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was scientific American.</v>

3281
02:25:49.331 --> 02:25:54.331
<v Speaker 2>I think about when people are wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something because here's the other</v>

3282
02:25:54.761 --> 02:25:59.761
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even if you voted for trump and he </v>

3283
02:25:59.761 --> 02:25:59.761
<v Speaker 2>promised you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3284
02:25:59.761 --> 02:26:00.910
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing jobs will come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of impossible given modern</v>

3285
02:26:00.911 --> 02:26:03.250
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He promised something that is sorta like</v>

3286
02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:06.580
<v Speaker 2>technologically not a feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3287
02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:09.370
<v Speaker 2>even if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if when you voted for him,</v>

3288
02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:12.820
<v Speaker 2>you were right to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going to give you.</v>

3289
02:26:12.821 --> 02:26:15.160
<v Speaker 2>He said Isis in 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been more than 30 days,</v>

3290
02:26:15.161 --> 02:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>hasn't done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3291
02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:18.630
<v Speaker 2>when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3292
02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy fucking lied to me.</v>

3293
02:26:20.861 --> 02:26:23.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard for us to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our ego.</v>

3294
02:26:23.321 --> 02:26:25.960
<v Speaker 2>And there was an article in scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>American help people in Grand,</v>

3295
02:26:25.961 --> 02:26:30.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure this study was skewed and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a specific group of people that sign up </v>

3296
02:26:31.331 --> 02:26:33.760
<v Speaker 2>for a study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that when someone was wrong,</v>

3297
02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:39.180
<v Speaker 2>when someone told them they were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made them believe their point even </v>

3298
02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:39.180
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

3299
02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the article I'll send,</v>

3300
02:26:41.390 --> 02:26:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it to you or are they doubled </v>
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>

3301
02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:46.040
<v Speaker 2>But if you say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3302
02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:51.060
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's the CIA that uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as a form of questioning is that </v>

3303
02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:54.391
<v Speaker 2>you first have to legitimize their </v>
<v Speaker 2>position before you suggest that there </v>

3304
02:26:54.391 --> 02:26:54.391
<v Speaker 2>might be something flawed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go like,</v>

3305
02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:59.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand that you would </v>

3306
02:26:59.760 --> 02:26:59.760
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3307
02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:00.100
<v Speaker 2>the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see why you would thought that.</v>

3308
02:27:00.101 --> 02:27:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grew up here.</v>

3309
02:27:01.001 --> 02:27:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Of course you thought that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathize with them first and then say,</v>

3310
02:27:04.290 --> 02:27:06.250
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but turns out it's round.</v>

3311
02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.820
<v Speaker 2>They'll more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more likely to come around.</v>

3312
02:27:09.821 --> 02:27:10.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3313
02:27:10.451 --> 02:27:11.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking wrong.</v>

3314
02:27:11.650 --> 02:27:15.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you show them proof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they doubled down even further on there.</v>

3315
02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:17.260
<v Speaker 2>What's the worst thing you say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's upset?</v>

3316
02:27:17.261 --> 02:27:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>

3317
02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:21.320
<v Speaker 2>They just get fucking furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3318
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:25.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a non.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a non respecting thing.</v>

3319
02:27:25.071 --> 02:27:26.960
<v Speaker 3>You're not respecting the person's state</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mind.</v>

3320
02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:30.200
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not objectively stepping back and</v>

3321
02:27:30.201 --> 02:27:35.201
<v Speaker 3>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does this person really feel right </v>

3322
02:27:35.201 --> 02:27:35.201
<v Speaker 3>now and what's the best one?</v>

3323
02:27:35.201 --> 02:27:35.201
<v Speaker 2>You're a demoralizing and what we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is demoralizing each other,</v>

3324
02:27:35.201 --> 02:27:35.880
<v Speaker 2>but going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking wrong.</v>

3325
02:27:35.881 --> 02:27:40.881
<v Speaker 2>You're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And something that was interesting just </v>

3326
02:27:40.881 --> 02:27:43.701
<v Speaker 2>from an I know that I am in Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know anything about </v>

3327
02:27:43.701 --> 02:27:43.701
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't have to tweet it.</v>

3328
02:27:43.701 --> 02:27:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one thing I do know is that,</v>

3329
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:51.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was sort of fascinated by the </v>

3330
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:53.250
<v Speaker 2>comedians role in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this election because as the dino </v>

3331
02:27:53.250 --> 02:27:57.660
<v Speaker 2>news fails us in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedians sometimes tend to sort of </v>

3332
02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:57.660
<v Speaker 2>show up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3333
02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:00.300
<v Speaker 2>and tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm in every movie.</v>

3334
02:28:00.390 --> 02:28:03.210
<v Speaker 2>The underdog always has to win and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3335
02:28:03.211 --> 02:28:06.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just really fucking baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3336
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:08.610
<v Speaker 2>What is the field of dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rocky?</v>

3337
02:28:08.611 --> 02:28:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

3338
02:28:10.650 --> 02:28:15.650
<v Speaker 2>everybody beating up on him and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just making him the underdog and </v>

3339
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:17.250
<v Speaker 2>underdogs always have to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like some weird human nature,</v>

3340
02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:18.870
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also the president,</v>

3341
02:28:18.871 --> 02:28:21.930
<v Speaker 2>like you can't really be the underdog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be the Kenya anything.</v>

3342
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:26.990
<v Speaker 1>He was an underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think during the election we were </v>

3343
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:26.990
<v Speaker 1>beating up on him and I think we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going q stupid,</v>

3344
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:28.190
<v Speaker 1>you're dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not qualified.</v>

3345
02:28:28.191 --> 02:28:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3346
02:28:28.971 --> 02:28:31.160
<v Speaker 1>we gotta fucking root for that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were,</v>

3347
02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:36.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just going to take the establishment </v>

3348
02:28:36.250 --> 02:28:36.250
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile he's bringing in all these</v>

3349
02:28:36.250 --> 02:28:37.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3350
02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And people tweeting about them just gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>them hundreds of millions of dollars of </v>

3351
02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:44.921
<v Speaker 1>free press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just sort of interesting how we </v>

3352
02:28:44.921 --> 02:28:45.500
<v Speaker 1>sort of hoodwinked ourselves and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting about them.</v>

3353
02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:50.501
<v Speaker 1>The things that he said were the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that CNN decided they were going to </v>

3354
02:28:50.501 --> 02:28:53.261
<v Speaker 1>cover and now he won't let CNN into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press or the New York Times wouldn't let</v>

3355
02:28:53.691 --> 02:28:58.691
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times the press gaggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he let info wars and all these other</v>

3356
02:28:59.390 --> 02:29:02.290
<v Speaker 1>weird websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's,</v>

3357
02:29:02.291 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very odd.</v>

3358
02:29:04.130 --> 02:29:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's unprecedented that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3359
02:29:06.890 --> 02:29:11.420
<v Speaker 1>he's limiting access to the press.</v>

3360
02:29:11.530 --> 02:29:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean he filed for reelection five </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours after he won.</v>

3361
02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3362
02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:22.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's something amazing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he has figured out a way to </v>

3363
02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:27.130
<v Speaker 1>hypnotize a nation or a world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's something just so primal </v>

3364
02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:29.780
<v Speaker 1>at play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The juke in the system the same way he's</v>

3365
02:29:29.781 --> 02:29:32.700
<v Speaker 1>choked the system with taxes and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3366
02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:37.720
<v Speaker 1>with the filing for bankruptcy were </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly designed to follow rules and to </v>

3367
02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:39.080
<v Speaker 1>comply with what is socially acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3368
02:29:39.081 --> 02:29:41.020
<v Speaker 1>That's like how we get dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like just fit in,</v>

3369
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:42.920
<v Speaker 1>be part of the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you stay safe.</v>

3370
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:46.340
<v Speaker 1>And he is not one of those people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just pretty fascinating what.</v>

3371
02:29:46.341 --> 02:29:48.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

3372
02:29:48.081 --> 02:29:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unprecedented that this person,</v>

3373
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:53.840
<v Speaker 1>that the lies all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's logically,</v>

3374
02:29:54.010 --> 02:29:55.130
<v Speaker 1>pathologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3375
02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:55.880
<v Speaker 1>But you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3376
02:29:55.890 --> 02:30:00.890
<v Speaker 1>but these getting called on it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is weird to see that the reporter </v>

3377
02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:04.690
<v Speaker 1>who said he said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that you won by the largest </v>

3378
02:30:04.690 --> 02:30:04.760
<v Speaker 1>margin.</v>

3379
02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It was someone told me that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3380
02:30:06.801 --> 02:30:07.500
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3381
02:30:07.501 --> 02:30:09.620
<v Speaker 1>it was amongst Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he said no,</v>

3382
02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:14.000
<v Speaker 1>because George h dot w dot Bush had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger electoral college victory.</v>

3383
02:30:14.010 --> 02:30:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>

3384
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:16.520
<v Speaker 1>They told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've been told,</v>

3385
02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:19.220
<v Speaker 1>but there's also within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of back to the horse thing,</v>

3386
02:30:19.221 --> 02:30:21.650
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't matter what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you say it.</v>

3387
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do people care if they're being lied</v>

3388
02:30:24.831 --> 02:30:29.831
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're being lied to in an </v>

3389
02:30:29.831 --> 02:30:29.831
<v Speaker 1>authoritative way with someone who seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>very confident,</v>

3390
02:30:29.831 --> 02:30:30.590
<v Speaker 1>like they know what they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

3391
02:30:30.620 --> 02:30:32.030
<v Speaker 1>what's going to chip away at them </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

3392
02:30:32.031 --> 02:30:35.210
<v Speaker 1>This is what I really believe that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these times where he's being checked,</v>

3393
02:30:35.610 --> 02:30:40.610
<v Speaker 1>this is the reason why you won't go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the White House press correspondents' </v>

3394
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:40.990
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's weird saying,</v>

3395
02:30:42.490 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 1>well this is member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he wouldn't go on the debates,</v>

3396
02:30:44.631 --> 02:30:45.850
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't go on CNN.</v>

3397
02:30:45.850 --> 02:30:46.370
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened.</v>

3398
02:30:46.371 --> 02:30:48.580
<v Speaker 1>This has been going on where he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>refuses to be president.</v>

3399
02:30:48.581 --> 02:30:53.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't Hae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't not even moved in and he's been </v>

3400
02:30:53.581 --> 02:30:54.050
<v Speaker 1>golfing most of his presidency and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused us money.</v>

3401
02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:59.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sends his kids on these business </v>

3402
02:30:59.370 --> 02:31:01.541
<v Speaker 1>trips to go set up hotels and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that don't have to protect </v>

3403
02:31:01.541 --> 02:31:04.250
<v Speaker 1>this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell if people care,</v>

3404
02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:06.440
<v Speaker 1>but little known yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been.</v>

3405
02:31:06.470 --> 02:31:09.440
<v Speaker 1>It's only been 30 something days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long has he been in the White House?</v>

3406
02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:11.150
<v Speaker 1>January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3407
02:31:11.151 --> 02:31:13.340
<v Speaker 1>so he's been in the White House a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a month.</v>

3408
02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people are just living their </v>

3409
02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:18.910
<v Speaker 1>lives and they're busy and they're busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just don't even have time while</v>

3410
02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:20.400
<v Speaker 1>for that information to trickle</v>

3411
02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:23.370
<v Speaker 2>into the entire country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's getting into some people.</v>

3412
02:31:23.371 --> 02:31:24.820
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3413
02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's New York Times writers who are </v>

3414
02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:30.330
<v Speaker 2>writing on on a daily basis and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different authors.</v>

3415
02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just think there's something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be said for and I'm working on this in </v>

3416
02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:36.040
<v Speaker 2>my life to be able to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong.</v>

3417
02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:40.050
<v Speaker 2>You got me good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hoodwinked me and I'm wrong.</v>

3418
02:31:40.051 --> 02:31:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And now what do you think that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to do that though?</v>

3419
02:31:42.001 --> 02:31:47.001
<v Speaker 2>Because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's acquiescing to the left or just </v>

3420
02:31:47.001 --> 02:31:47.001
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3421
02:31:47.001 --> 02:31:50.430
<v Speaker 2>or just being sane going like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was bamboozled and,</v>

3422
02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:55.460
<v Speaker 2>but being seen as not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work when you have these </v>

3423
02:31:55.460 --> 02:31:56.840
<v Speaker 2>party politics when you're tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribal,</v>

3424
02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:02.200
<v Speaker 2>so team oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just something that's </v>

3425
02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:04.341
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in us to have an enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enemy to fight with and then it </v>

3426
02:32:05.191 --> 02:32:06.450
<v Speaker 2>becomes all about our projections.</v>

3427
02:32:06.460 --> 02:32:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really been hard because I'm trying</v>

3428
02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:09.720
<v Speaker 2>to sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially going on stage,</v>

3429
02:32:09.721 --> 02:32:14.130
<v Speaker 2>like I had a riot breakout and Napa </v>
<v Speaker 2>people started fighting in a crowd.</v>

3430
02:32:14.390 --> 02:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>What were you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they write it.</v>

3431
02:32:15.930 --> 02:32:18.540
<v Speaker 2>This was before the election and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really started out with being like,</v>

3432
02:32:18.541 --> 02:32:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3433
02:32:18.871 --> 02:32:22.290
<v Speaker 2>politics is not my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people who are much better at it</v>

3434
02:32:22.291 --> 02:32:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and I let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to talk about squirting,</v>

3435
02:32:24.391 --> 02:32:26.450
<v Speaker 2>you come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I know my,</v>

3436
02:32:26.490 --> 02:32:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I stay in my lane and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this felt like something that was </v>

3437
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.490
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3438
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.910
<v Speaker 2>beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3439
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:36.980
<v Speaker 2>something that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost feels weird to ignore it on </v>

3440
02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:36.980
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the elephant linear.</v>

3441
02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:38.250
<v Speaker 2>And so I was talking about it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3442
02:32:38.251 --> 02:32:40.320
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying who I think should win.</v>

3443
02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I think both candidates have flaws.</v>

3444
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I think there's one that's less flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

3445
02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:47.850
<v Speaker 2>And I said something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3446
02:32:47.851 --> 02:32:49.950
<v Speaker 2>if bill is in the White House because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be interested.</v>

3447
02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:51.600
<v Speaker 2>First female president was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about like,</v>

3448
02:32:51.601 --> 02:32:56.601
<v Speaker 2>what happens with the first female </v>
<v Speaker 2>president now I think that there should </v>

3449
02:32:56.601 --> 02:32:59.241
<v Speaker 2>be a rule saying that the first female </v>
<v Speaker 2>male can cheat.</v>

3450
02:32:59.431 --> 02:33:01.860
<v Speaker 2>So because the woman doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't have time to fuck him,</v>

3451
02:33:01.890 --> 02:33:05.280
<v Speaker 2>like she doesn't have time and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman yelled out.</v>

3452
02:33:05.281 --> 02:33:08.910
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you talk about Hillary?</v>

3453
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3454
02:33:10.021 --> 02:33:12.240
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the most conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas in the country.</v>

3455
02:33:12.241 --> 02:33:17.241
<v Speaker 2>You need to know your audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This lady said that she was in the </v>

3456
02:33:17.241 --> 02:33:17.340
<v Speaker 2>second row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was with me the entire time.</v>

3457
02:33:17.850 --> 02:33:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Turns on me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just know your audience like I now</v>

3458
02:33:25.081 --> 02:33:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I realized wrongly was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

3459
02:33:26.791 --> 02:33:27.930
<v Speaker 2>you need to know your comedian.</v>

3460
02:33:27.930 --> 02:33:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a bad.</v>

3461
02:33:31.170 --> 02:33:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>

3462
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the audience all went after her</v>

3463
02:33:38.551 --> 02:33:43.551
<v Speaker 2>and then her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had like a bunch of people with her </v>

3464
02:33:43.551 --> 02:33:43.551
<v Speaker 2>and it was just turned into like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Malay.</v>

3465
02:33:43.551 --> 02:33:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Like it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3466
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you would have loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was here in Napa.</v>

3467
02:33:46.801 --> 02:33:51.801
<v Speaker 2>They're probably drunk as shit faced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so scared and because it was not,</v>

3468
02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:54.450
<v Speaker 2>no one was tractable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like,</v>

3469
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:55.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bodyguard,</v>

3470
02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:57.720
<v Speaker 2>it was like everybody was getting up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting with everybody.</v>

3471
02:33:57.930 --> 02:33:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3472
02:33:58.950 --> 02:34:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't really talked about on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

3473
02:34:00.571 --> 02:34:02.280
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so deep.</v>

3474
02:34:02.281 --> 02:34:05.460
<v Speaker 2>It's so visceral with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're in war.</v>

3475
02:34:05.461 --> 02:34:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean this country's in a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

3476
02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:12.460
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil war and I can't and you can't </v>

3477
02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:12.460
<v Speaker 2>bring it up with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is like,</v>

3478
02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm walking on eggshells </v>
<v Speaker 2>around it and this is the first time I </v>

3479
02:34:17.390 --> 02:34:17.390
<v Speaker 2>think I've ever even talked about.</v>

3480
02:34:17.390 --> 02:34:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't even tweet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of like,</v>

3481
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:19.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did the show end?</v>

3482
02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Fire quickly earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my check and it cleared.</v>

3483
02:34:23.770 --> 02:34:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

3484
02:34:24.791 --> 02:34:29.791
<v Speaker 2>they had to be like 16 people had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed when the show went on and I </v>

3485
02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:35.800
<v Speaker 2>ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me,</v>

3486
02:34:35.801 --> 02:34:40.801
<v Speaker 2>like if someone tells me I just had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had to go harder at the political </v>

3487
02:34:40.801 --> 02:34:44.551
<v Speaker 2>thing and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of thing where I thrive </v>

3488
02:34:44.551 --> 02:34:44.740
<v Speaker 2>and adrenaline and conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

3489
02:34:44.741 --> 02:34:46.240
<v Speaker 2>bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how I grew up.</v>

3490
02:34:46.241 --> 02:34:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't clucking I'm looking for an excuse</v>

3491
02:34:49.091 --> 02:34:50.740
<v Speaker 2>to fight people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don't do this,</v>

3492
02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:55.980
<v Speaker 2>don't you think you also have being fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting out and doing a lot of work </v>

3493
02:34:55.980 --> 02:34:58.500
<v Speaker 2>rather at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking original room comic,</v>

3494
02:34:58.501 --> 02:35:03.501
<v Speaker 2>like you fucked with the wrong monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the idea she could say know your </v>

3495
02:35:03.501 --> 02:35:07.030
<v Speaker 2>audience the most conservative place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the like she was like,</v>

3496
02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:07.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3497
02:35:07.931 --> 02:35:10.840
<v Speaker 2>cater your material to us.</v>

3498
02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Which was just so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was one of those.</v>

3499
02:35:14.591 --> 02:35:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was really demeaning and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was really.</v>

3500
02:35:17.651 --> 02:35:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think I also was like got very </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply insulted.</v>

3501
02:35:20.021 --> 02:35:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3502
02:35:21.250 --> 02:35:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I was a slot machine that are like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>jukebox where she puts money in and I'm </v>

3503
02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:27.820
<v Speaker 2>just supposed to do what she wants me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and I was like,</v>

3504
02:35:27.821 --> 02:35:32.821
<v Speaker 2>comedians were the only ones left who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are taking risks and saying shit that no</v>

3505
02:35:33.761 --> 02:35:36.340
<v Speaker 2>one else will say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

3506
02:35:36.341 --> 02:35:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt like it was an attack on </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech in general.</v>

3507
02:35:39.611 --> 02:35:44.611
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well people have their ideas of what </v>

3508
02:35:44.611 --> 02:35:44.611
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3509
02:35:44.611 --> 02:35:45.160
<v Speaker 2>this is how you're supposed to behave if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're this,</v>

3510
02:35:45.161 --> 02:35:47.320
<v Speaker 2>this is how you're supposed to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bedside manner.</v>

3511
02:35:47.321 --> 02:35:49.210
<v Speaker 2>If you're a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a comedian,</v>

3512
02:35:49.570 --> 02:35:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know you have to tailor your jokes.</v>

3513
02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like if you're.</v>

3514
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for,</v>

3515
02:35:54.081 --> 02:35:59.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think if a comedian doesn't make </v>

3516
02:35:59.081 --> 02:35:59.081
<v Speaker 2>you a little uncomfortable at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

3517
02:35:59.081 --> 02:36:00.070
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of not doing our job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3518
02:36:00.130 --> 02:36:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I always think it's hilarious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone tells you not to talk about </v>

3519
02:36:05.130 --> 02:36:05.130
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone tells you next subject.</v>

3520
02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had someone to yell out </v>
<v Speaker 2>next subject?</v>

3521
02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had some pretty,</v>

3522
02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:15.260
<v Speaker 2>well I've had sometimes I'm Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christie,</v>

3523
02:36:15.310 --> 02:36:19.600
<v Speaker 2>a pointed out to me one time that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to open for me a long time,</v>

3524
02:36:19.601 --> 02:36:23.020
<v Speaker 2>about 45 minutes into my set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone always turns on me.</v>

3525
02:36:24.490 --> 02:36:28.240
<v Speaker 2>It's usually a man who just has had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink and I've turned.</v>

3526
02:36:28.241 --> 02:36:33.241
<v Speaker 2>I turned into their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a woman talking to a microphone at </v>

3527
02:36:33.241 --> 02:36:36.031
<v Speaker 2>you for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will become your mother or your ex </v>

3528
02:36:36.031 --> 02:36:39.211
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl who didn't fucking you in high </v>

3529
02:36:39.211 --> 02:36:39.211
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

3530
02:36:39.211 --> 02:36:39.211
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The booze.</v>

3531
02:36:39.211 --> 02:36:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

3532
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.340
<v Speaker 2>And one time we were in the Hoya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

3533
02:36:42.341 --> 02:36:45.850
<v Speaker 2>is the most just chaotic group of sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of drunk people.</v>

3534
02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Xanax and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did this joke about like how guys </v>

3535
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.230
<v Speaker 2>ages ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3536
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3537
02:36:51.970 --> 02:36:52.620
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3538
02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:58.080
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every guy is like a jar of coins in </v>

3539
02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:58.080
<v Speaker 2>their house somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3540
02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:58.900
<v Speaker 2>like pennies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's like a,</v>

3541
02:36:58.990 --> 02:37:03.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like a or like a bowl of coins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3542
02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:06.430
<v Speaker 2>everyone's laughing and blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy just snaps at me.</v>

3543
02:37:06.431 --> 02:37:09.010
<v Speaker 2>He had been in the front row laughing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire time and he was just like,</v>

3544
02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:14.280
<v Speaker 2>that's so we can pay for a year and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly I realized</v>

3545
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:21.190
<v Speaker 1>that I had transmogrified into someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3546
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:27.250
<v Speaker 1>so it's triggering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean going into see comedy can be </v>

3547
02:37:27.250 --> 02:37:27.250
<v Speaker 1>triggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be.</v>

3548
02:37:27.250 --> 02:37:27.710
<v Speaker 1>That's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3549
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:30.230
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he went to sort of a different</v>

3550
02:37:30.231 --> 02:37:30.800
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3551
02:37:30.801 --> 02:37:35.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we basically trigger drunk people for a </v>

3552
02:37:35.801 --> 02:37:35.801
<v Speaker 1>living that just want to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have with that.</v>

3553
02:37:35.801 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so innocuous.</v>

3554
02:37:36.711 --> 02:37:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Like why would anybody be upset the have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jar of coins.</v>

3555
02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of funny because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of guys do.</v>

3556
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You have a jar and they chuck coins in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then they eventually bring it to </v>

3557
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:46.000
<v Speaker 1>the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go do something with this.</v>

3558
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like a shitty observational </v>

3559
02:37:50.050 --> 02:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>jokes from six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3560
02:37:50.050 --> 02:37:53.981
<v Speaker 1>But I get a lot of times I'm the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying thing is actually just when </v>

3561
02:37:53.981 --> 02:37:54.770
<v Speaker 1>people are like so true.</v>

3562
02:37:58.950 --> 02:38:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Like just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I.</v>

3563
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:06.010
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that compliments the backhanded </v>

3564
02:38:06.010 --> 02:38:06.010
<v Speaker 1>compliments after the show are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst.</v>

3565
02:38:06.010 --> 02:38:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you're really funny for them or </v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't you think people would just </v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward?</v>

3579
02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get awkward.</v>

3580
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just like a guy trying to contact</v>

3581
02:38:45.591 --> 02:38:50.591
<v Speaker 1>you on a dating app.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to like sort of </v>

3582
02:38:50.591 --> 02:38:50.591
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3583
02:38:50.591 --> 02:38:51.830

3584
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Next question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitting in front of his phone,</v>

3585
02:38:54.501 --> 02:38:56.060
<v Speaker 1>trying to think of the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:59.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you get people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must have people.</v>

3587
02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:02.570

<v Speaker 1>like with celebrities who are like movie</v>

3588
02:39:02.571 --> 02:39:03.530

<v Speaker 1>I find,</v>

3594
02:39:11.841 --> 02:39:13.480
<v Speaker 1>at least with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3595
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:17.390
<v Speaker 1>people are super comfortable even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>so because of the podcast.</v>

3600
02:39:23.810 --> 02:39:26.330
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is sometimes I'm with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and they just want to talk to me.</v>

3601
02:39:26.331 --> 02:39:27.230

<v Speaker 3>sucked by a bunch of guys.</v>

3646
02:40:57.290 --> 02:40:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3647
02:40:58.160 --> 02:40:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

3648
02:41:00.030 --> 02:41:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I listened to the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obsessed with Ron</v>

3649
02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>in a million ways and I remember when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3650
02:41:07.571 --> 02:41:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I just want respect from my peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

3651
02:41:10.030 --> 02:41:12.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we say things that no one else,</v>

3652
02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:15.670
<v Speaker 2>everyone thinks but no one else says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it gives them grace to them.</v>

3653
02:41:15.671 --> 02:41:17.770
<v Speaker 2>So I think we sort of serve that </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

3654
02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's got to be the worst thing</v>

3655
02:41:19.911 --> 02:41:22.390
<v Speaker 3>in the world is even being successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3656
02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.290
<v Speaker 3>we can name a few people that are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3657
02:41:24.291 --> 02:41:28.040
<v Speaker 3>but even being successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hated and despised by their peers.</v>

3658
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:29.840
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't,</v>

3659
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:32.090
<v Speaker 3>you're a man without a country like </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3660
02:41:32.091 --> 02:41:32.620
<v Speaker 3>your law.</v>

3661
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:34.630
<v Speaker 2>The only people that understood me now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3662
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:36.650
<v Speaker 2>that happened when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a TV show and all the,</v>

3663
02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.880
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store and the comments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like my family,</v>

3664
02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got a show and then all of a </v>

3665
02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:46.640
<v Speaker 2>sudden everyone was mad at me and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the was around back then.</v>

3666
02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:47.180
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3667
02:41:47.270 --> 02:41:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think when that was.</v>

3668
02:41:49.330 --> 02:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>It was like five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years,</v>

3669
02:41:50.210 --> 02:41:53.000
<v Speaker 2>five years ago maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the loneliest I've ever felt.</v>

3670
02:41:53.001 --> 02:41:58.001
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only people who understand me now </v>

3671
02:41:58.001 --> 02:41:58.001
<v Speaker 2>hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So jealous and week.</v>

3672
02:41:58.001 --> 02:41:59.150
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

3673
02:41:59.151 --> 02:42:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I now know that it was just like them </v>
<v Speaker 2>being insecure and wanting,</v>

3674
02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:07.540
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody now has everyone's </v>

3675
02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:07.540
<v Speaker 2>got a show now</v>

3676
02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:10.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that do have </v>

3677
02:42:10.650 --> 02:42:12.391
<v Speaker 3>this feeling that's never gonna happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>for them and there is no greater way to </v>

3678
02:42:12.391 --> 02:42:17.011
<v Speaker 3>ensure that it's never going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you then to have this feeling and </v>

3679
02:42:17.011 --> 02:42:17.770
<v Speaker 3>ride it out that it's never going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen for you.</v>

3680
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's self fulfilling prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the opposite of a placebo </v>

3681
02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 3>effect</v>

3682
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:28.570
<v Speaker 2>when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you better be ready because it's </v>

3683
02:42:28.570 --> 02:42:28.570
<v Speaker 2>not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not ready.</v>

3684
02:42:28.570 --> 02:42:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if you're ready,</v>

3685
02:42:28.971 --> 02:42:30.800
<v Speaker 3>it might not work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it doesn't work,</v>

3686
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:33.260
<v Speaker 3>you can't think it's the end of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta keep going,</v>

3687
02:42:33.290 --> 02:42:34.850
<v Speaker 3>you gotta keep set of Cameron.</v>

3688
02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:40.020
<v Speaker 2>But if you haven't healed the wound that</v>
<v Speaker 2>made you want the thing in the first </v>

3689
02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:40.020
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is not going to affect.</v>

3690
02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone into depth with comedians </v>

3691
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:45.130
<v Speaker 3>about that because I think that's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing to think.</v>

3692
02:42:45.131 --> 02:42:47.170
<v Speaker 3>We all started out from a fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3693
02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Every comedian that's any good starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>out from a place of insecurity and </v>

3694
02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:54.850
<v Speaker 3>weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then somewhere along the line you've</v>

3695
02:42:54.851 --> 02:42:58.330
<v Speaker 3>got to become more secure and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to become about art.</v>

3696
02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:01.480
<v Speaker 3>It's got to become about creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's good that people enjoy,</v>

3697
02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and then it's got to be about doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that people.</v>

3698
02:43:05.561 --> 02:43:07.720
<v Speaker 3>It's going to enhance people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

3699
02:43:07.721 --> 02:43:12.721
<v Speaker 3>like they're going to go to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for an hour and a half that show </v>

3700
02:43:12.721 --> 02:43:16.230
<v Speaker 3>going to be so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to feel they're going to </v>

3701
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.230
<v Speaker 3>literally feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's got to be that healer.</v>

3702
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're.</v>

3703
02:43:16.931 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 3>You're whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good feeling you get out of that.</v>

3704
02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Here's the sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna.</v>

3705
02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to like,</v>

3706
02:43:22.980 --> 02:43:27.980
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy onstage killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the creating in the process and the </v>

3707
02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:32.641
<v Speaker 3>going over the material and writing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the chipping away at your fucking why is</v>

3708
02:43:32.741 --> 02:43:34.340
<v Speaker 3>it suck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This topic sucks.</v>

3709
02:43:34.350 --> 02:43:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Should I abandon it or should I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep working at it</v>

3710
02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:39.670
<v Speaker 2>or it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking cheap.</v>

3711
02:43:39.690 --> 02:43:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why the fuck are you guys laughing </v>

3712
02:43:44.690 --> 02:43:44.690
<v Speaker 2>at this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sucks.</v>

3713
02:43:44.690 --> 02:43:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that sort of self love and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate yourself.</v>

3714
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:50.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like figuring out a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to heal the wound that made you funny </v>

3715
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:53.470
<v Speaker 2>but also stay funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you be healthy and funny?</v>

3716
02:43:53.530 --> 02:43:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my biggest question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Struggle.</v>

3717
02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not easy.</v>

3718
02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:02.420
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a balancing act and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something that happens to </v>

3719
02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:04.961
<v Speaker 3>comedians when they become famous that </v>
<v Speaker 3>their main motivation was to get that </v>

3720
02:44:04.961 --> 02:44:06.920
<v Speaker 3>love and then they get it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking suck.</v>

3721
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happens that you stay </v>

3722
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:13.421
<v Speaker 2>complacent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You stop needing the approval or you </v>

3723
02:44:13.421 --> 02:44:13.421
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3724
02:44:13.421 --> 02:44:14.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the perfectionism thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectionism is a lot of why I'm like,</v>

3725
02:44:14.961 --> 02:44:19.961
<v Speaker 2>so like my bar is so high for what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say on stage and if I lower that bar as </v>

3726
02:44:20.270 --> 02:44:21.830
<v Speaker 2>it going to be less quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3727
02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:27.160
<v Speaker 2>maintaining like you just need more </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcement personally in your </v>

3728
02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:31.730
<v Speaker 2>personal life to relax your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectionism in your career.</v>

3729
02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:34.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're right.</v>

3730
02:44:34.311 --> 02:44:36.170
<v Speaker 2>And I think what happened is aligning a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people are like,</v>

3731
02:44:36.171 --> 02:44:39.020
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean you made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your everyone knows you and you're like,</v>

3732
02:44:39.021 --> 02:44:41.450
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means I have to be even better.</v>

3733
02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the bar is now higher.</v>

3734
02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:45.690
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're scared to do a set at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice house.</v>

3735
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of like,</v>

3736
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:48.900
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

3737
02:44:48.990 --> 02:44:53.760
<v Speaker 2>a like allergy to doing old material and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me feel like a phony,</v>

3738
02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:55.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should give it to some people.</v>

3739
02:44:55.441 --> 02:44:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you spit in their mouth?</v>

3740
02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:01.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3741
02:45:01.831 --> 02:45:04.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of open your mouth so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can spit in it happening.</v>

3742
02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys think we like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk directly to camera.</v>

3743
02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of.</v>

3744
02:45:09.331 --> 02:45:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Let me spit in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather you spend on my face.</v>

3745
02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spitting in the mouth.</v>

3746
02:45:13.501 --> 02:45:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I have to like swap.</v>

3747
02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:17.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just like sexually spit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spit in your mouth.</v>

3748
02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Let me spit in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

3749
02:45:19.921 --> 02:45:22.080
<v Speaker 2>When did come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mouth becomes so boring.</v>

3750
02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Now there's the spinning in the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of spitting.</v>

3751
02:45:25.430 --> 02:45:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a lot of spending.</v>

3752
02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:29.100
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Degradation.</v>

3753
02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have heard though,</v>

3754
02:45:32.161 --> 02:45:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I heard from a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

3755
02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:36.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with what's the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful thing a woman can do.</v>

3756
02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And I've had a couple guys say spit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my face.</v>

3757
02:45:39.330 --> 02:45:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in general,</v>

3758
02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:41.910
<v Speaker 2>like not sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3759
02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:44.970
<v Speaker 2>like a woman who doesn't like you or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3760
02:45:45.060 --> 02:45:50.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy I know his wife spit in his </v>

3761
02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:50.060
<v Speaker 2>face when they were in a fight and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

3762
02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.760
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took every molecule in my body not </v>

3763
02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:56.640
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to work the back right here.</v>

3764
02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Just lose my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kill her.</v>

3765
02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:04.100
<v Speaker 2>That was his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most disrespectful because I'm </v>

3766
02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:04.100
<v Speaker 2>always interested in what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3767
02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:04.500
<v Speaker 2>people will stay with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3768
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:06.310
<v Speaker 2>She's married three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

3769
02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to Barry,</v>

3770
02:46:07.861 --> 02:46:10.970
<v Speaker 2>he's in the military like he's all about</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and whatever.</v>

3771
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.090
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to push that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she can slap me all day long,</v>

3772
02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:17.030
<v Speaker 2>but spitting in my face that is the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful thing you can do to a man.</v>

3773
02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:19.740
<v Speaker 3>So very dangerous thing when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical with people.</v>

3774
02:46:20.050 --> 02:46:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Super Dangerous People's.</v>

3775
02:46:21.730 --> 02:46:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting.</v>

3776
02:46:23.031 --> 02:46:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a very high tolerance for </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical disrespect.</v>

3777
02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean just I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was dealing with this with my </v>

3778
02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:33.680
<v Speaker 2>horse the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was disrespectful horses.</v>

3779
02:46:33.681 --> 02:46:37.220
<v Speaker 2>So you have to claim your space with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse and you have to draw a boundary if</v>

3780
02:46:37.221 --> 02:46:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you guys are going to like be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can kill you.</v>

3781
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really do it with eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do it with dogs.</v>

3782
02:46:42.471 --> 02:46:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3783
02:46:44.181 --> 02:46:49.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just sort of claim your space and </v>

3784
02:46:49.181 --> 02:46:50.951
<v Speaker 2>they actually respect you more and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you more when you have self respect and </v>

3785
02:46:50.951 --> 02:46:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you have sort of your boundary or else </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just walk all over you.</v>

3786
02:46:52.791 --> 02:46:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's metaphorical.</v>

3787
02:46:53.721 --> 02:46:55.190
<v Speaker 2>You don't seem to have this problem in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

3788
02:46:55.420 --> 02:46:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with dogs,</v>

3789
02:46:56.660 --> 02:46:58.790
<v Speaker 2>you also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a dog to lay on top of you,</v>

3790
02:46:58.791 --> 02:47:01.760
<v Speaker 2>that's dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We mistake it is like we're curdling but</v>

3791
02:47:01.761 --> 02:47:03.650
<v Speaker 2>they're actually in your space and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3792
02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:04.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I own you now.</v>

3793
02:47:04.970 --> 02:47:05.810
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3794
02:47:05.811 --> 02:47:10.811
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of times with my dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially since I get rescue dogs who </v>

3795
02:47:10.811 --> 02:47:11.510
<v Speaker 2>are unpredictable and pimples have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very high arousal rate.</v>

3796
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:14.830
<v Speaker 2>So I can't just let them lay on me all </v>
<v Speaker 2>night long and stuff.</v>

3797
02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I have to then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're off of me and you're my </v>

3798
02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:19.840
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not your bitch.</v>

3799
02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Because that could backfire later.</v>

3800
02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3801
02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Dogs are so weird when you rescue them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you just don't know what the </v>

3802
02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:29.120
<v Speaker 3>fuck they had to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't know.</v>

3803
02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3804
02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:34.420
<v Speaker 2>And I made some major mistakes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistaking physical proximity with like </v>

3805
02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:37.850
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll be fine,</v>

3806
02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:39.900
<v Speaker 2>but when they're full grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3807
02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:43.620
<v Speaker 2>because if they get possessive of you or</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to you or um,</v>

3808
02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:46.220
<v Speaker 2>we sometimes think that's so cute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's actually dominant.</v>

3809
02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also when you bring other people </v>

3810
02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:54.011
<v Speaker 3>into your life and then this dog decides</v>
<v Speaker 3>to other people stealing you from them </v>

3811
02:47:54.011 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 3>and they get aggressive towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other person,</v>

3812
02:47:54.861 --> 02:47:55.610
<v Speaker 3>it becomes an issue.</v>

3813
02:47:55.740 --> 02:47:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3814
02:47:56.341 --> 02:47:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs are just extensions of their own or</v>

3815
02:47:58.621 --> 02:48:03.621
<v Speaker 2>like you also have to let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can talk to whoever the fuck I </v>

3816
02:48:03.621 --> 02:48:03.690
<v Speaker 2>want and you're not allowed to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with it.</v>

3817
02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:07.400
<v Speaker 2>So they're not allowed to get possessive</v>
<v Speaker 2>over you like that if you,</v>

3818
02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:08.670
<v Speaker 2>if you train them properly.</v>

3819
02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:10.710
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The puppy that I got,</v>

3820
02:48:10.711 --> 02:48:11.680
<v Speaker 3>the Golden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3821
02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:14.520
<v Speaker 3>we brought him home and he gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone kisses.</v>

3822
02:48:14.521 --> 02:48:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Everyone kisses everyone because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet.</v>

3823
02:48:16.770 --> 02:48:18.510
<v Speaker 3>But it gets to me and he wants to bite </v>
<v Speaker 3>my face.</v>

3824
02:48:18.810 --> 02:48:21.540
<v Speaker 3>He bites my face and he would play super</v>
<v Speaker 3>rough with me.</v>

3825
02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Like right away he was like nipping at </v>
<v Speaker 3>but not hard.</v>

3826
02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't hurting me,</v>

3827
02:48:25.261 --> 02:48:30.261
<v Speaker 3>but he's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's an animal.</v>

3828
02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3829
02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:36.900
<v Speaker 2>have you put his lip under his teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put your lip just show that they </v>

3830
02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:38.130
<v Speaker 2>learn how sharp their own teeth are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3831
02:48:38.390 --> 02:48:43.390
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also bite them back to bite </v>

3832
02:48:43.390 --> 02:48:43.390
<v Speaker 2>them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3833
02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I usually just put them on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3834
02:48:45.171 --> 02:48:47.860
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and cut the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold them down with both of his,</v>

3835
02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to bite me when I'm </v>

3836
02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:53.280
<v Speaker 2>doing it because their mouth is their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

3837
02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not trying to hurt you.</v>

3838
02:48:54.270 --> 02:48:55.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3839
02:48:55.190 --> 02:49:00.190
<v Speaker 3>he's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he thinks my six year old is a </v>

3840
02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:00.190
<v Speaker 3>puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

3841
02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a little puppy buddy.</v>

3842
02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Like he bites her clothes and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to keep them from doing that and</v>

3843
02:49:03.961 --> 02:49:06.450
<v Speaker 3>he's not being mean at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about clothes.</v>

3844
02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3845
02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:11.330
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know until you tell them </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong.</v>

3846
02:49:11.331 --> 02:49:16.331
<v Speaker 2>Like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are so bad at training their </v>

3847
02:49:16.331 --> 02:49:16.331
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shocking.</v>

3848
02:49:16.331 --> 02:49:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Like what I see like just in the streets</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see someone with their dog,</v>

3849
02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:18.870
<v Speaker 2>like their dogs tugging and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3850
02:49:18.871 --> 02:49:20.070
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3851
02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does your dog,</v>

3852
02:49:21.421 --> 02:49:23.400
<v Speaker 2>the one that speaks English and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>sarcasm.</v>

3853
02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Like what you would you stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like the way you're saying it </v>

3854
02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:30.000
<v Speaker 2>does not match what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a command.</v>

3855
02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:33.640
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really into training dogs in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rigorous way too.</v>

3856
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:35.880
<v Speaker 2>You also have to teach them my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3857
02:49:35.881 --> 02:49:40.881
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dog doesn't understand his name </v>

3858
02:49:40.881 --> 02:49:40.881
<v Speaker 2>being used a bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3859
02:49:40.881 --> 02:49:42.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no Marshall Marshall,</v>

3860
02:49:43.410 --> 02:49:48.410
<v Speaker 2>you've got to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Children don't even understand that </v>

3861
02:49:48.410 --> 02:49:48.410
<v Speaker 2>sarcasm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3862
02:49:48.410 --> 02:49:48.720
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3863
02:49:48.721 --> 02:49:53.721
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people I think mistake and they </v>

3864
02:49:53.721 --> 02:49:53.721
<v Speaker 2>conflate discipline with being mean to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog or something.</v>

3865
02:49:53.721 --> 02:49:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not true.</v>

3866
02:49:54.601 --> 02:49:57.780
<v Speaker 2>It's discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discipline is so nice to a dog.</v>

3867
02:49:58.050 --> 02:49:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3868
02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:00.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

3869
02:50:00.301 --> 02:50:01.500
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also when I see people,</v>

3870
02:50:01.501 --> 02:50:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some real disasters with </v>
<v Speaker 2>placing dogs in homes where people don't</v>

3871
02:50:05.041 --> 02:50:08.730
<v Speaker 2>train their kids how to deal with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dog.</v>

3872
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Child's going to get their face bitten </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

3873
02:50:10.471 --> 02:50:15.471
<v Speaker 2>like I get so scared because people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>let their kid hit the dog in the face </v>

3874
02:50:15.471 --> 02:50:17.610
<v Speaker 2>and shake their face and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to train your child.</v>

3875
02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially a dog dog,</v>

3876
02:50:20.970 --> 02:50:23.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a danger and bringing a dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>around children.</v>

3877
02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:27.120
<v Speaker 2>The first place kids are like another </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog and my dog's are giant.</v>

3878
02:50:27.121 --> 02:50:28.730
<v Speaker 2>My dog hurts me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've three.</v>

3879
02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:32.370
<v Speaker 2>They hurt me by accident all of the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm an adult.</v>

3880
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll bend over to pick something up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll come by and I.</v>

3881
02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't mean to iron heads.</v>

3882
02:50:38.060 --> 02:50:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are like my just blockheads.</v>

3883
02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:41.600
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3884
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:46.670
<v Speaker 2>my big dog has a great Dane pitbull and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just knocks me out the time.</v>

3885
02:50:46.891 --> 02:50:49.140
<v Speaker 2>So when kids come over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go in the crates,</v>

3886
02:50:49.350 --> 02:50:50.700
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

3887
02:50:50.701 --> 02:50:52.890
<v Speaker 2>why am I writing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to take chances.</v>

3888
02:50:52.891 --> 02:50:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a selfie with the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just put it in a crate.</v>

3889
02:50:56.371 --> 02:50:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Super Dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got razor blades in its mouth.</v>

3890
02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:04.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna make a mistake sooner or </v>

3891
02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:04.040
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

3892
02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3893
02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I used to be really naive about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting with German </v>

3894
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:11.781
<v Speaker 2>shepherds apparently in a Ketos and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always say if anything looks too much </v>

3895
02:51:11.781 --> 02:51:16.491
<v Speaker 2>like a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like be fucking super care for around </v>

3896
02:51:16.491 --> 02:51:20.030
<v Speaker 2>kids with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this guy that has really been </v>

3897
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.030
<v Speaker 2>helping this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brandon Mcmillan,</v>

3898
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:24.350
<v Speaker 2>he's got a show called lucky dog on cbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he taught me how to aggression test </v>

3899
02:51:24.350 --> 02:51:28.701
<v Speaker 2>dogs with two leashes and stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just getting these dogs from </v>

3900
02:51:28.701 --> 02:51:28.701
<v Speaker 2>shelters that had been abused and stuff.</v>

3901
02:51:28.701 --> 02:51:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my love isn't gonna make you trained?</v>

3902
02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:37.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like living in the valley with </v>

3903
02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:38.310
<v Speaker 2>a yard that's gonna fix you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

3904
02:51:38.410 --> 02:51:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've learned to sort of honor,</v>

3905
02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neurology of dogs and their </v>

3906
02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:47.901
<v Speaker 2>instincts and they were wolves and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and food comes first and if they have a </v>

3907
02:51:48.151 --> 02:51:53.151
<v Speaker 2>scarcity complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're going to go after food and </v>

3908
02:51:53.151 --> 02:51:56.031
<v Speaker 2>if they've been abused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have no reason to not protect </v>

3909
02:51:56.031 --> 02:51:57.930
<v Speaker 2>themselves if they feel threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that dog whisperer guy?</v>

3910
02:51:57.931 --> 02:52:00.180
<v Speaker 2>That Cesar Milan guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he good or is he?</v>

3911
02:52:00.181 --> 02:52:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's like,</v>

3912
02:52:01.410 --> 02:52:06.410
<v Speaker 2>all these guys have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure like any like fighting or </v>

3913
02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:06.410
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got logged,</v>

3914
02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:06.850
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

3915
02:52:06.851 --> 02:52:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've figured out what works for me,</v>

3916
02:52:09.521 --> 02:52:10.570
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3917
02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically positive reinforcement or just</v>

3918
02:52:13.361 --> 02:52:14.890
<v Speaker 2>ignoring the dog when they do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

3919
02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:16.960
<v Speaker 2>So the biggest punishment to a dog was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just ignoring them.</v>

3920
02:52:17.170 --> 02:52:22.170
<v Speaker 2>When you hit them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually giving them attention </v>

3921
02:52:22.170 --> 02:52:22.170
<v Speaker 2>and confusing them or when you yell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3922
02:52:22.170 --> 02:52:26.730
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's confusing to them and it probably </v>

3923
02:52:26.730 --> 02:52:29.611
<v Speaker 2>doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They usually just lose respect for you </v>

3924
02:52:29.611 --> 02:52:32.071
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've gotten into a situation </v>

3925
02:52:32.071 --> 02:52:32.071
<v Speaker 2>where you're now hitting them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>

3926
02:52:32.071 --> 02:52:34.080
<v Speaker 2>why did you let me do that yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3927
02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:39.300
<v Speaker 2>you're the one that's inconsistent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they just start to feel unsafe and </v>

3928
02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:39.790
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they do something wrong,</v>

3929
02:52:39.791 --> 02:52:43.000
<v Speaker 2>just ignore them for 30 minutes and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>will never do it again.</v>

3930
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Because you read books on dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do read books on dogs.</v>

3931
02:52:46.590 --> 02:52:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you read books on more people or </v>

3932
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.590
<v Speaker 2>dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

3933
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.760
<v Speaker 2>do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3934
02:52:52.330 --> 02:52:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your dog is a reflection here.</v>

3935
02:52:54.370 --> 02:52:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3936
02:52:54.791 --> 02:52:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about it sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

3937
02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read a lot of books on like </v>

3938
02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:01.680
<v Speaker 2>addiction and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3939
02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:03.190
<v Speaker 2>and like neuroscience that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3940
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm finishing that book sapiens right </v>

3941
02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:08.670
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that it's about like,</v>

3942
02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:09.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the guy's name is seth,</v>

3943
02:53:09.790 --> 02:53:11.590
<v Speaker 2>last name seth the or something.</v>

3944
02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically about evolution and how </v>

3945
02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:20.191
<v Speaker 2>we evolved to be the way we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his whole point is that we're a </v>

3946
02:53:20.191 --> 02:53:23.880
<v Speaker 2>non.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole point one of them that I find </v>

3947
02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:25.741
<v Speaker 2>interesting is like that the reason we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have so much anxiety is because we know </v>

3948
02:53:25.741 --> 02:53:25.741
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3949
02:53:25.741 --> 02:53:30.180
<v Speaker 2>like we implicitly know that we're only </v>
<v Speaker 2>superficially at the top of the food </v>

3950
02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:30.180
<v Speaker 2>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't,</v>

3951
02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:33.040
<v Speaker 2>we don't deserve to be at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>food chain without weapons.</v>

3952
02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm in here with a gorilla alone,</v>

3953
02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose real quickly if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm in here with a gun,</v>

3954
02:53:39.791 --> 02:53:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I still might lose actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3955
02:53:41.891 --> 02:53:46.891
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that we're all kind of like walking </v>

3956
02:53:46.891 --> 02:53:47.920
<v Speaker 2>around with paper thin scan and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly vulnerable.</v>

3957
02:53:48.250 --> 02:53:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just happen to have,</v>

3958
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animals that kill us in cages.</v>

3959
02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's incredibly fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 3>that anatomically similar humans who </v>

3960
02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:01.351
<v Speaker 3>lived 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago as we were talking about with </v>

3961
02:54:01.351 --> 02:54:02.350
<v Speaker 3>cro magnon who literally didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>very many tools or weapons,</v>

3962
02:54:02.351 --> 02:54:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have guns for sure.</v>

3963
02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:06.460
<v Speaker 3>And maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean had adult adult or something like</v>

3964
02:54:06.461 --> 02:54:11.461
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't find out when they invented the </v>

3965
02:54:11.461 --> 02:54:11.461
<v Speaker 3>bone arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

3966
02:54:11.461 --> 02:54:11.461
<v Speaker 3>let's figure that out</v>

3967
02:54:11.461 --> 02:54:12.440
<v Speaker 2>in the bone marrow is also not a sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3968
02:54:12.441 --> 02:54:17.441
<v Speaker 2>You got one chance if you miss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have another 10 minutes so you can </v>

3969
02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:18.920
<v Speaker 2>panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3970
02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.000
<v Speaker 3>And you brought me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times have you had to shoot a </v>

3971
02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:24.000
<v Speaker 3>bow and Arrow when your life depends.</v>

3972
02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it once.</v>

3973
02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:27.040
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing that people before then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3974
02:54:27.130 --> 02:54:29.170
<v Speaker 3>so let's go back even earlier than </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

3975
02:54:29.171 --> 02:54:34.171
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably hope not a whole lot of </v>

3976
02:54:34.171 --> 02:54:34.171
<v Speaker 3>difference between those people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people 100,000</v>

3977
02:54:34.171 --> 02:54:38.401
<v Speaker 3>years ago with the amount of tissue and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the softness of the body and the </v>

3978
02:54:38.401 --> 02:54:42.871
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's kind of crazy that we even </v>

3979
02:54:42.871 --> 02:54:42.871
<v Speaker 3>made it.</v>

3980
02:54:42.871 --> 02:54:45.810
<v Speaker 2>We're made of the fact that we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the day without a up balloons of</v>

3981
02:54:46.451 --> 02:54:48.450
<v Speaker 2>blood bees can kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3982
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Bees are the literally tiniest animal.</v>

3983
02:54:51.330 --> 02:54:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bow and Arrow appears to transition from</v>

3984
02:54:53.521 --> 02:54:56.540
<v Speaker 3>the Upper Paleolithic to the Meso </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lithic,</v>

3985
02:54:57.890 --> 02:54:59.140
<v Speaker 3>so blah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Extent bows in one piece</v>

3989
02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:06.590
<v Speaker 1>or Elm Houma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guard bows from Denmark,</v>

3990
02:55:06.591 --> 02:55:08.690
<v Speaker 1>which were dated to 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

3991
02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3992
02:55:10.970 --> 02:55:15.970

<v Speaker 1>I like how they do that now before </v>

3993
02:55:15.970 --> 02:55:15.970
<v Speaker 1>current era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even about Jesus.</v>

3994
02:55:15.970 --> 02:55:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa suggested arrows might be at </v>

3995
02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:20.800
<v Speaker 1>least 71,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

3996
02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

3997
02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:25.210
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

3998
02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had arrows for like 50,000</v>

3999
02:55:28.521 --> 02:55:29.620
<v Speaker 1>years for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figured out the bow.</v>

4000
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Got To do something with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has this always been here?</v>

4001
02:55:33.771 --> 02:55:35.960
<v Speaker 1>This epidemic of fear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4002
02:55:35.961 --> 02:55:37.730
<v Speaker 1>like this election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear.</v>

4003
02:55:37.731 --> 02:55:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

4004
02:55:38.451 --> 02:55:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they had a po folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people are going to tweet and running</v>

4005
02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:43.430
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all just going back in.</v>

4006
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:49.160
<v Speaker 1>History has always been here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the gun.</v>

4007
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:54.190
<v Speaker 1>People want guns in their house all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I'm not against people have </v>

4008
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:54.190
<v Speaker 1>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walls.</v>

4009
02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are people so scared?</v>

4010
02:55:57.651 --> 02:55:59.390
<v Speaker 1>People are going to take their guns away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>

4011
02:55:59.390 --> 02:56:01.100
<v Speaker 1>They need the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fear.</v>

4012
02:56:01.490 --> 02:56:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are.</v>

4013
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:08.510
<v Speaker 1>If I have a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my biggest theory is not just that some </v>

4014
02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:12.101
<v Speaker 1>people live in bad neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that we're dealing with the </v>

4015
02:56:12.101 --> 02:56:14.411
<v Speaker 1>news of 7 billion humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just too much and we see now that </v>

4016
02:56:14.411 --> 02:56:18.260
<v Speaker 1>we have the news and we see so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative things happening that we have a</v>

4017
02:56:18.261 --> 02:56:20.900
<v Speaker 1>false sense of how dangerous the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

4018
02:56:21.010 --> 02:56:23.660
<v Speaker 1>where this is all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the safest we've ever been.</v>

4019
02:56:23.970 --> 02:56:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Scared us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've ever been.</v>

4020
02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Are We?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a scarce we ever </v>

4021
02:56:30.220 --> 02:56:30.220
<v Speaker 1>been because a lot of people are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Xanax again.</v>

4022
02:56:30.220 --> 02:56:33.670
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be scared if they weren't on </v>

4023
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be shitting their pants,</v>

4024
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:35.690
<v Speaker 1>but everyone is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4025
02:56:35.870 --> 02:56:40.870
<v Speaker 1>terrified all the time and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an interesting thing and trying </v>

4026
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:43.661
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what's a real fear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a sort of reptilian irrational </v>

4027
02:56:43.661 --> 02:56:43.661
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

4028
02:56:43.661 --> 02:56:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what we were talking about before </v>

4029
02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:50.051
<v Speaker 1>that one day and probably not far from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to exist in some sort of</v>

4030
02:56:51.230 --> 02:56:54.980
<v Speaker 1>electronic state where it exists in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a weird virtual state.</v>

4031
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's going to be interesting to</v>

4032
02:56:57.231 --> 02:57:02.231
<v Speaker 1>see what that state is even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable because we'll have fucking </v>

4033
02:57:02.231 --> 02:57:04.670
<v Speaker 1>google glasses over our heads and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>our fucking spinal cord to connect it to</v>

4034
02:57:04.671 --> 02:57:09.671
<v Speaker 1>the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to have peripheral vision </v>

4035
02:57:09.671 --> 02:57:10.220
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're devolving in some way for sure.</v>

4036
02:57:10.250 --> 02:57:11.330
<v Speaker 1>We're definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4037
02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:13.820
<v Speaker 1>we're evolving into a more vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

4038
02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:19.060
<v Speaker 1>which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily that we're </v>

4039
02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:19.060
<v Speaker 1>devolving because we're not becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like animals.</v>

4040
02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becoming more like,</v>

4041
02:57:20.001 --> 02:57:25.001
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some study that came out that </v>

4042
02:57:25.001 --> 02:57:27.161
<v Speaker 1>said that kids who play video games </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have faster reflexes and kids </v>

4043
02:57:27.161 --> 02:57:27.161
<v Speaker 1>who don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4044
02:57:27.161 --> 02:57:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting.</v>

4045
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That is so maybe reflexes have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mind and the hands reacting </v>

4046
02:57:33.051 --> 02:57:34.790
<v Speaker 1>hand eye coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4047
02:57:34.791 --> 02:57:36.600
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to move quick and.</v>

4048
02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.040
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I'm physically moving your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body side to side.</v>

4049
02:57:40.041 --> 02:57:45.041
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the dexterity or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength to do that because they're </v>

4050
02:57:45.041 --> 02:57:45.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking just stuck to the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll win.</v>

4051
02:57:46.130 --> 02:57:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a thumb war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be an actual threat.</v>

4052
02:57:49.071 --> 02:57:54.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the threat was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was talking about how they're </v>

4053
02:57:54.071 --> 02:57:56.741
<v Speaker 1>doing these teams for basketball that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to do alongside the NBA team.</v>

4054
02:57:58.520 --> 02:57:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4055
02:57:58.910 --> 02:58:03.570
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna play electronic basketball</v>
<v Speaker 1>alongside real basketball games.</v>

4056
02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Explain it here in the NBA is sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>league diversity means a new kind of </v>

4057
02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:10.350
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

4058
02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:11.910
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have a.</v>

4059
02:58:12.370 --> 02:58:17.370
<v Speaker 6>They haven't announced it fully because </v>
<v Speaker 6>every team isn't fully locked into it </v>

4060
02:58:17.370 --> 02:58:17.370
<v Speaker 6>yet right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

4061
02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:18.760
<v Speaker 6>every team,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea,</v>

4062
02:58:18.761 --> 02:58:23.761
<v Speaker 6>the thing is every team is going to have</v>
<v Speaker 6>their own five on five video game team </v>

4063
02:58:23.761 --> 02:58:27.480
<v Speaker 6>and they're gonna be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 6>signing good players and there's going </v>

4064
02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:30.691
<v Speaker 6>to be competitions and big that ideally </v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to have the finalists in </v>

4065
02:58:30.691 --> 02:58:30.980
<v Speaker 6>arenas too for this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The finals</v>

4066
02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:33.080
<v Speaker 1>in arenas to do for like other games </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

4067
02:58:33.081 --> 02:58:37.800
<v Speaker 1>like league of legends goes and plays in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a staple center sort of.</v>

4068
02:58:38.120 --> 02:58:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified by the fact that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsourcing physical sports to our </v>

4069
02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:45.860
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat next to a guy on the plane who was</v>

4070
02:58:45.861 --> 02:58:50.861
<v Speaker 1>playing darts on his phone starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

4071
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:56.110
<v Speaker 1>He was just sitting there moving his </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger show Whitney has a phone with a </v>

4072
02:58:59.301 --> 02:59:01.810
<v Speaker 1>photo of this guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

4073
02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:06.860
<v Speaker 1>he's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the that he thinks this is a </v>

4074
02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:06.860
<v Speaker 1>sport plus he's drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is shit.</v>

4075
02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got shit face on him and he was also </v>

4076
02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:11.380
<v Speaker 1>wearing shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was really traumatizing for me,</v>

4077
02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but it was just this and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you think this is a thing </v>

4078
02:59:15.610 --> 02:59:16.880
<v Speaker 1>he was made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just scrolling up.</v>

4079
02:59:17.390 --> 02:59:22.390
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he thought he was good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>darts or he was freaking out about air </v>

4080
02:59:23.811 --> 02:59:28.811
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's getting drunk and medicated and </v>

4081
02:59:28.811 --> 02:59:28.811
<v Speaker 1>it's distracting himself with a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

4082
02:59:28.811 --> 02:59:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry that we're all just zombies.</v>

4083
02:59:30.770 --> 02:59:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I think you should stop being so scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4084
02:59:32.481 --> 02:59:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

4085
02:59:33.141 --> 02:59:38.141
<v Speaker 1>Just live in this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's end it strong because we've </v>

4086
02:59:38.141 --> 02:59:38.141
<v Speaker 1>already done three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4087
02:59:38.141 --> 02:59:38.141
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send this strong.</v>

4088
02:59:38.141 --> 02:59:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

4089
02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to squirt.</v>

4090
02:59:42.890 --> 02:59:45.380
<v Speaker 1>People are by sub miracles still </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this.</v>

4091
02:59:45.381 --> 02:59:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4092
02:59:46.250 --> 02:59:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they are.</v>

4093
02:59:47.930 --> 02:59:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something.</v>

4094
02:59:49.671 --> 02:59:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Do your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we got to do this more often,</v>

4095
02:59:51.740 --> 02:59:53.360
<v Speaker 1>get me Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So embarrassed.</v>

4096
02:59:53.361 --> 02:59:55.160
<v Speaker 1>That's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not embarrassing at all.</v>

4097
02:59:55.490 --> 02:59:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need more positive reinforcement.</v>

4098
02:59:57.380 --> 02:59:59.180

03:00:21.620 --> 03:00:22.940
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't work for me and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The domains will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've listened to.</v>

4115
03:00:24.771 --> 03:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4116
03:00:26.660 --> 03:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that I had was editors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to get me to write </v>

4117
03:00:31.660 --> 03:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

4118
03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I want you to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4119
03:00:32.991 --> 03:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>they wanted me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

4120
03:00:34.281 --> 03:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to write anything.</v>

4121
03:00:35.751 --> 03:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>We'll just take your stand up and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcribe it.</v>

4122
03:00:38.511 --> 03:00:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

4123
03:00:39.411 --> 03:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I've already done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4124
03:00:40.730 --> 03:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>but they go bold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin did that and then Jerry </v>

4125
03:00:45.730 --> 03:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

4126
03:00:45.730 --> 03:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what they did.</v>

4127
03:00:45.730 --> 03:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like from a write something.</v>

4128
03:00:47.031 --> 03:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a different kind of medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4129
03:00:48.770 --> 03:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

4130
03:00:49.401 --> 03:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there bombing all day.</v>

4131
03:00:53.050 --> 03:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my worst nightmare.</v>

4132
03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I have to wait eight months to see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's funny and people laugh.</v>

4135
03:01:05.971 --> 03:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the tone and fuck all that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because this is just like Amanda.</v>

4137
03:01:10.330 --> 03:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's wants to not do standup </v>
