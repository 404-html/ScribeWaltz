which I know which are national headliners and very hilarious guys.

35
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.740
Well,

36
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.850
I can't say if it's a guy or a girl.

37
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.530
One of them was fucking famous as shit,

38
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.130
but apparently this bitch is too big to have her name put on the,

39
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:54.731

Fucking Sebastian speaking a comedy store over here and what's happening.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.120
Nice to be here.

52
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.460
You and I have been friends for a long fucking time.

53
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:19.210
My friend.

54
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.730
I remember when you first started 1998 you were very am very

55
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.350
<v 0>prevalent at the comedy store.</v>

56
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.340
When I first came there.

57
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:27.174
You were right.

58
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.960
You were there every night and then you left and now you're back.

59
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.451
I love it back,

61
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:32.751
man.

62
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:32.990
I'm,

63
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.771
I'm having a great time.

64
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.290
I think this is the golden age of that place.

65
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm fucking amazing now,

66
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:38.500
right?

67
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.320
<v 0>Compared to some of the Times that we shared there when,</v>

68
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.950
uh,

69
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.641
2000,

70
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:43.451
2001,

71
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:46.720
I was a young fledgling comedian and a

72
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.380
<v 1>snake skin.</v>

73
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.730
See through shirts.

74
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.270
You definitely had a very interesting style,

75
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.390
like a Long Island club style.

76
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.100
I was trying to bring the nightclub scene to the stage.

77
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:02.150
That's what I guess it was.

78
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.320
I tried that once.

79
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.921
I mean,

80
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.480
didn't you ever go through like,

81
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.950
I got to have an outfit?

82
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.953
Yeah.

83
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.043
What was your own?

84
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.360
My first time on stage.

85
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.440
This is how retarded I am.

86
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.040
Uh,

87
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.250
not just my first time at first three or four times I tried to dress like a

88
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.410
comedian from that movie punchline,

89
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.311
you know,

90
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.620
like I would wear like the sneakers with a dentist,

91
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.540
like a jacket,

92
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:24.231
like a blazer,

93
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:28.640
but with the sleeves rolled up and maybe a wacky tee shirt or I had a wacky pin,

94
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.760
like a pin with a smiley face with a bullet hole in his head or something.

95
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.810
Oh.

96
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.740
So embarrassing.

97
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.290
When I stop and think about what a fucking tool I was,

98
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.980
you know,

99
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.240
but I used that said the normal kind of,

100
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.300
but how was wearing Melrose avenue snake skin?

101
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.030
See seethrough where you could see my nip.

102
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.130
You were too.

103
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.791
I remember it.

104
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:56.690
This isn't bullshit.

105
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.760
You would wear some of the wackiest shit.

106
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.080
Yeah,

107
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.381
it was,

108
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.040
it was awful.

109
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 0>It was trying to find my footing,</v>

110
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:01.900
you know?

111
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
I was just trying to be different than a,

112
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.381
yeah,

113
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.640
I had to go through that stage.

114
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:06.960
Right.

115
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.290
<v 1>Was that all your idea or did you have a manager that,</v>

116
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.200
<v 0>no,</v>

117
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.100
this is all me.

118
00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:13.260
I came up with these marketing scheme

119
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.490
when I first came out to Los Angeles.

120
00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.830
I was coming from Chicago and I come from a family where my father was a

121
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:24.690
hairdresser and my mother was a secretary.

122
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:26.190
Nobody's in the entertainment business.

123
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:26.521
So I'm like,

124
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:27.930
how am I going to crack into this?

125
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.560
So what I did was I went and I took some modeling shots off the express way and

126
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:35.100
some weeds.

127
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.490
This is professional shots and wheat.

128
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.630
Yeah,

129
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.231
I did the,

130
00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:40.920
um,

131
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.000
I don't know if he ever did the,

132
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:42.450
uh,

133
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.930
like Barb has sign modeling thing where you heard it on the radio.

134
00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:47.130
If you think you got it,

135
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:48.810
come down and Oh yeah,

136
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:49.650
I did that.

137
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.640
So I went in,

138
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:55.020
I took my photos,

139
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.801
I brought him home.

140
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:56.810
My mother's like that.

141
00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:57.360
The photos.

142
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.193
Beautiful.

143
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.660
You got to send this out.

144
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.790
This is,

145
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.650
Holly was going to love this salt.

146
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.660
What I did was I shrank it down into like a four by six and at the time they had

147
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.210
at Photoshop on the back you could uh,

148
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.440
you could uh,

149
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.840
there was like a bunch of people watching a movie screen.

150
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.450
So in the movie scream you could type tax.

151
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.480
So I typed in coming this summer Sebastian go like it was a movie.

152
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.200
I didn't put any phone number.

153
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.810
I figured I'm just gonna I'm just going to wet their beak with the photo.

154
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.210
This is how sick I was.

155
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.000
So I'm thinking the casting directors are going to get it and go.

156
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.470
Oh and then he didn't leave a number.

157
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.090
So when I got to la I sent out another batch and it said now playing in Los

158
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.640
Angeles with the phone number,

159
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.900
now I'm one phone call,

160
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.750
one call zero is it?

161
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.350
That was my entree I want,

162
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:01.740
it felt like there was at least one doc that trying to fuck you.

163
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.340
If I was a sleazy,

164
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:07.400
the

165
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.260
<v 1>casting director and I was of the gay inclination of the year,</v>

166
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.350
my fucking kind of guy,

167
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.630
terrific bite.

168
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.760
Not Teachers that gave bike seat through snakeskin shirt.

169
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.271
Fucking,

170
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:20.871
hey man,

171
00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:21.800
this is my guy.

172
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.730
I have a waiting for him to call.

173
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.913
Terrible.

174
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.121
I went,

175
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:26.390
uh,

176
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.220
I went on stage one weekend,

177
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.740
one of the worst times ever bombed in my life.

178
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.610
There was a buff,

179
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.890
a bunch of factors that led to this bombing,

180
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.660
but I'm one of them that I was dressed up like I was going out to a club and a

181
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.230
I,

182
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.550
there's like the first time I'd ever done it,

183
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:41.770
like I had cavalry cheese.

184
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.770
You remember cavalry cheese,

185
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.040
they were like tight at the top and they kind of ballooned out a little bit in

186
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:46.874
the legs.

187
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.571
Very nice.

188
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:50.090
I had like a nice shirt button up look good.

189
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:55.091
I had hair back then and I was on stage and just fucking eat and plates of Shit.

190
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.600
And then I remember was like being so uncomfortable with the way I was dressing

191
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.434
and bombing.

192
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.640
I went on have to brewer.

193
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.310
It was like one of them.

194
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.730
It was one of the pivotal moments of my young career.

195
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.110
I'd only been doing comedy like

196
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.770
I got to say like three years maybe.

197
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.160
And I was headline and really shit.

198
00:06:11.161 --> 00:06:13.010
I've been headline and really didn't have the time.

199
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.880
It's just bullshit.

200
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.210
I was,

201
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.720
I bullshitted my way into position and I kind of pulled it off until Saturday

202
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.721
night,

203
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:18.554
late night show,

204
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.740
Saturday late night show brewer went up and lit the fucking place on fire.

205
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:24.621
I mean,

206
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:28.040
he crushed like I'd never seen any comic crush before.

207
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:28.910
Up until that moment.

208
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.650
It was just like Jesus.

209
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.390
I was terrified backstage.

210
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.100
Fucking terrified.

211
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.990
Just didn't know how to follow anybody back then.

212
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.830
Didn't know how to laugh at it and just ride the wave and have fun.

213
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.140
Just it went up there and eight plates a shit.

214
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.520
But part of it was definitely,

215
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:45.380
I was super uncomfortable with the way I was dressed.

216
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:45.681
I was like,

217
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:46.700
what am I doing?

218
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.980
But where are you wearing that offs where you were a caviar,

219
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.730
ICI guy,

220
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.600
or did you just figure it out?

221
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:51.470
How I was trying to get laid,

222
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:52.191
I guess I probably would have.

223
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.540
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

224
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.100
I was so lost.

225
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.870
I would wear whatever works.

226
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.090
You know when you're trying to get laid and you're a young guy,

227
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.220
you fucking wear whatever they like.

228
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.550
The clothing is entirely dictated by the success.

229
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.830
Like women's appeal,

230
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:11.420
like what women find appealing.

231
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.373
That's what we wear.

232
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.700
Whatever the fuck they does.

233
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.960
The reason why the fanny pack,

234
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.880
this is why people can't wear fanny packs.

235
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.680
My beloved fanny pack right here,

236
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.780
see I'm married and I could pull that shit off.

237
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.130
If you're not trying to get laid,

238
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.360
you can wear that fucking thing.

239
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.230
Or if you don't give a fuck,

240
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:24.951
if you get divorced,

241
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:25.784
you can wear that thing.

242
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.343
But if you,

243
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.250
if you're a guy,

244
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:31.370
if you're a young guy hoping to impress the Gao and you walk around with a

245
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:34.750
fucking bag bolted to your waist,

246
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.013
you know,

247
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.330
you get aware of what they want you to wear this.

248
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.460
It's all dictated by women fashion.

249
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.050
If it was just man on the planet,

250
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.840
there would be no fucking designer shoes.

251
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.561
They would be,

252
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:46.550
there would be nothing.

253
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.331
There would be nothing.

254
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.590
We don't be wearing skins.

255
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.110
We'd all be wearing animal skins or whatever the fuck is comfortable.

256
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:52.430
Cotton shit shorts.

257
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.070
Nobody would give a fuck if there was no women.

258
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.930
If it was just removed from the equation,

259
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:57.770
if no longer,

260
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.170
if there was no like not only were there no women,

261
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.430
like we didn't need to reproduce.

262
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:04.190
People live forever and every guy that's here is going to be here forever.

263
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.850
That's it.

264
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.150
This is the,

265
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.440
these are the people done.

266
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.710
It would be the fashion industry would tank.

267
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.530
It would go crashing down to the ground so quick.

268
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.550
But does your wife have any say in what you wear and like Joey,

269
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:18.640
you want to put like a button up on?

270
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.830
If we go out she will ask me to wear something nice.

271
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.000
If we go out,

272
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.430
like if we're going out to a nice dinner somewhere and we'll do like a date

273
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.070
night gold,

274
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.050
nice little restaurant.

275
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:29.510
We've been lately going to these Michelin rated restaurants.

276
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.373
You ever do that?

277
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.780
You go look and find,

278
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.380
oh is a Michelin rated one.

279
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.320
Oh it's a five star one and you go to these place.

280
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.393
If you're go to those,

281
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.600
they still have miscellaneous.

282
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.760
It is worth going because it's all those crazy foodie people that give you ever

283
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:44.630
met a real foodie,

284
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:45.560
like a legit Foodie,

285
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.191
you know,

286
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.880
like they'll tell you like where the spots are and we have some friends that are

287
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.120
like,

288
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.550
so like Brian Cowen knows all the spots.

289
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:54.680
Callen and his wife are like legit foodies.

290
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:55.643
Callan is like,

291
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.530
he's a legit foodie in no legit wine connoisseur.

292
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.640
Like he really knows.

293
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.500
I just remember shit.

294
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.180
I like try to pick stuff that's expensive.

295
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.110
That's 100 bucks.

296
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:04.944
It's got to be good.

297
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.750
You know what I mean?

298
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.583
It's like,

299
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.890
it can't be terrible and but Callen those like where it's from.

300
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.140
What part of frost that grow the great.

301
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:15.780
He'll tell you how the grapes are fucking different than the other grapes,

302
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.520
but these restaurants,

303
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.110
then we go to one of those.

304
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:19.770
Like she'll ask me,

305
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.580
I have to wear shoes.

306
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.510
I have crocodile shoes,

307
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.950
I crocodile skin shoes and fucking ideas.

308
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.301
What else?

309
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:25.490
Come out on initial and nights.

310
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.870
Yeah,

311
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.780
I won the other night.

312
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.980
Double Doubleday with calendar.

313
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.441
His wife.

314
00:09:29.441 --> 00:09:33.180
I'm a fucking gators on woo looking slick dude.

315
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:33.930
I'm telling you.

316
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.200
Is it something that you're aware that your wife hates every time you were like,

317
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.840
do you have like a six those barbell jeans,

318
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.670
those jeans that I have,

319
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.170
they're,

320
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.190
they're elastic cache there.

321
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.220
Fucking totally.

322
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.540
They're rubber jeans.

323
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.560
They're fucking elastic.

324
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.720
They look like jeans,

325
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:48.991
right?

326
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:49.260
Yeah.

327
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.093
But like,

328
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.330
but when you pull them,

329
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.320
they'll like this.

330
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.370
They'll like this cloth.

331
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.130
They look exactly like jeans.

332
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:57.660
Like I worry I'm on stage all the time.

333
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:59.790
But they don't bind you at all.

334
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.770
The companies send them to me.

335
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.240
Well there's a bunch of companies and diesel makes them now a lot of them,

336
00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:05.640
but they,

337
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.290
they don't make them with as much elastic as barbell.

338
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.570
The barbell is this shit.

339
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:10.620
Those are like fucking,

340
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.030
there is no resistance.

341
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.043
It's like,

342
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.950
like your legs can,

343
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.030
you can do full splits in them.

344
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.163
No problem at all.

345
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:16.891
You can,

346
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:18.330
you kick somebody in the head wearing those,

347
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.380
you wouldn't have any resistance.

348
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:20.670
Does not like them because they're not real.

349
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:23.250
This stick looking Nicholas get girls don't like,

350
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.250
they don't like,

351
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.490
and we find out you wearing rubber stretch jeans,

352
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.500
Robert Jan,

353
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.730
you can

354
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.000
find out you're fucking nuts.

355
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.260
But it's wearing them the mock him.

356
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.120
Sam,

357
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.020
is your husband still wearing those jeans?

358
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.860
Has He wearing yoga fans to you guys go out and he wears yoga pants.

359
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.560
So they're like yoga pants in gene form.

360
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.581
They're not that tight.

361
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:45.414
But

362
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.030
I have another pair that she fucking hates.

363
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.540
I only,

364
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.760
I think she hides him cause I can't find them.

365
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.810
They have a drawstring,

366
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.530
they have a like they tie at the top and she's like,

367
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:56.580
those are fat people.

368
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:57.414
Parents.

369
00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:58.921
And I go,

370
00:10:58.921 --> 00:10:59.371
well first of all,

371
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:00.240
you fat shaming.

372
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.373
Okay,

373
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.131
second of all,

374
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:03.780
if you are not overweight,

375
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:04.111
I am.

376
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:05.520
I'm not an overweight person.

377
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.510
So if I'm wearing these,

378
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:08.730
will you give a fuck if I'm wearing fat people jeans,

379
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.420
you know.

380
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.250
But to her like the fact that they have a string that you tie the top is

381
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:15.084
embarrassing.

382
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:15.521
Yeah,

383
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:15.960
I know.

384
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.793
No strings,

385
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.070
strings button.

386
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.360
Right then it works.

387
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:22.620
He was tying your clothes.

388
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:23.270
Forget it.

389
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:23.400
Yeah,

390
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.233
but why is that?

391
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.093
Oh No,

392
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.610
I got a few draw strings in the closet and nothing wrong with that.

393
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.180
Draw string jeans or listen,

394
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.560
I'm not up to the rubber gene.

395
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.630
That's a whole other deal.

396
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.370
All the companies are making them now.

397
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:43.770
I see him on the street like there's a big billboard the other day for this

398
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:44.221
other kid.

399
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:45.720
I think it really makes a pair of them.

400
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.220
Diesel makes him now.

401
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.040
Well then I got to look into it though.

402
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.680
Can do it.

403
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.530
I'm telling Ya go down Melrose.

404
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.130
Next time you're on one of those mad shopping,

405
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.930
<v 2>you gotta eat bags over your shoulder.</v>

406
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.510
That Melrose Street is a strange environment.

407
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.050
Well,

408
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.630
in the night in 1998 I used to live on that street,

409
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.810
used to go to all those stores and then they all kind of close,

410
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.020
so now it's going through kind of a weird resurgence,

411
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.290
so they don't really have those,

412
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.150
those leopard nipple shirts

413
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.470
now know every time I go by it's like a new store that's opened up a new coffee

414
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:21.304
shop.

415
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.080
Why a skateboarding shirt stores and things like that.

416
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.360
Did you see that skateboarding video that I posted on Instagram yesterday or

417
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.223
Youtube yesterday?

418
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.370
We played it on the show yesterday because we had a woman that had suffered from

419
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:34.600
a severe head trauma.

420
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.150
This fucking kid is going 70 miles an hour down a road in Colorado.

421
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.650
He's gotten this super deep,

422
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.410
steep hill and he's just talked like a skier,

423
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:48.430
like one of those speed skiers and he's fucking flying and it's just,

424
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.510
oh,

425
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.980
your hands get clammy,

426
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.540
your feet start twitch and you're like,

427
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:53.080
oh Jesus.

428
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.280
How Jesus saw Jesus.

429
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.870
Watch it when you get a chance.

430
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.220
I've seen one of those.

431
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.390
It was two guys though,

432
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:00.280
and they were going nuts.

433
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.120
If you wipe,

434
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.781
if you wipe,

435
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.810
you are so fucked when rock.

436
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.480
Yeah.

437
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.050
Anything.

438
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.291
Well,

439
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:07.930
I think they're probably pretty good at balance.

440
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:09.670
Like they could probably pick it up pretty good.

441
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.710
But this motherfuck area right there,

442
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.010
look at this crazy fucker filming it.

443
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.143
Probably a car.

444
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.440
I would imagine a car,

445
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.990
which is how they know he's going 70 miles an hour.

446
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.580
That's a very good question though.

447
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.960
Could be another asshole behind them.

448
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.310
It's also doing the same thing.

449
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.031
If he hits a rock,

450
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:26.170
the car's gonna kill him.

451
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.510
That's a very good question.

452
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.400
That's a very good point though.

453
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:30.671
Well,

454
00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:32.260
he'll go forward.

455
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:33.280
It's not like if he hits a rock,

456
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:34.600
he's gonna stop dead in its tracks.

457
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:35.680
He's going 70 miles an hour.

458
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.450
I don't know if you know a little thing about call it nurture.

459
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.730
You know the car's not going to know it's gonna hit a rock,

460
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.043
but the car,

461
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.930
he will not go that much slower is what I'm saying.

462
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:45.430
He's gonna fly forward.

463
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.970
If he,

464
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:46.840
if he wipes,

465
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.670
the guy's going to hit the brakes and he's going to go,

466
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:53.140
he doesn't have any breaks like so he's going to skid and remove all of his

467
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:53.974
skin.

468
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.100
When you ever seen someone who's gotten mad road rash,

469
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.310
did you see dean Delray?

470
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.830
He posted on his Instagram,

471
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:00.920
his whole side.

472
00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:05.500
It just skimmed off all his tattoos on his arms where he skinned his arms,

473
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:09.400
hurt his tattoos look brand new now because it just took a layer of skin off and

474
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:11.260
so it looks like he just got his tattoos again.

475
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:11.861
Was it like,

476
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:12.291
you know how you're,

477
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:13.150
you're exfoliating

478
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.860
tattoos fade,

479
00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:16.840
just get in a car accident.

480
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.300
Somebody hit him going 70 miles an hour,

481
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:27.301
a tweaker I suppose they car jacked a car and had accomplished following her.

482
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.100
She hits Dean going 70 miles an hour,

483
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.570
gets out of her car,

484
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.490
gets in the other car and takes off.

485
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.050
How does he know she was going 70 miles an hour?

486
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.910
He was just guessing because she,

487
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:38.890
he was going about 65 or so,

488
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.700
and then he saw her coming up behind them in the rear view,

489
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.620
like just going crazy fast.

490
00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:44.801
And he,

491
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:44.951
she,

492
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:46.150
he said that he was,

493
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.230
she was going so fast,

494
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.930
he didn't have a chance to like get out of the way or anything.

495
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:50.080
He,

496
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.410
she just went right into him.

497
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.000
How does he know she's a tweaker?

498
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.233
Uh,

499
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:54.810
no,

500
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.780
it was a carjacking so most likely he's lucky.

501
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:00.614
He's okay,

502
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.000
but he was going on stage tonight.

503
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.450
Yeah.

504
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.940
He's forgetting the super cars going to get a hero's welcome tonight.

505
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.970
He was at the comedy store last night and,

506
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:08.150
uh,

507
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.451
you said,

508
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:09.590
see how many people were like,

509
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.891
oh,

510
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:10.461
are you okay?

511
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.590
I'm doing the Pat.

512
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.030
If you get a new tattoo,

513
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:15.050
that's the first fucking thing

514
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.571
<v 1>people do.</v>

515
00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:16.800
They slapped that tattoo.

516
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:17.881
They can't even help it.

517
00:15:17.881 --> 00:15:19.380
I think it's like a magnet thing.

518
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.330
I think people are attracted to your injury.

519
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.000
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

520
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.430
But he's supposedly quitting a motorcycles,

521
00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:25.264
which is interesting.

522
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.150
He said he got out of it is get out of jail free card or whatever.

523
00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:28.631
So He's,

524
00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:30.190
he's looking at a Volkswagen right now.

525
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.430
<v 1>Wow.</v>

526
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.503
Good for him.

527
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.050
Yeah.

528
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.010
It's a scary thing,

529
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:34.500
man.

530
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.333
Scary thing.

531
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.910
<v 0>You're like a thrill seeker motorcycle.</v>

532
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.823
<v 1>Don't you have a motorcycle?</v>

533
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.040
I'm fucking torn.

534
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.930
I'm like a half of two different people.

535
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.350
I'm fucking terrified of everything and I do a lot of dangerous shit.

536
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:47.981
But no,

537
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.000
I don't have a motorcycle.

538
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.200
I came close,

539
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:50.951
but,

540
00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:51.041
uh,

541
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.200
I was actually going through the motorcycle safety course,

542
00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:57.070
the whole deal with a couple buddies of mine that still ride my buddy Peter

543
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:57.940
Hirsh co he's still riding.

544
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.781
Um,

545
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:01.840
but when we were doing it to people I know wiped bad.

546
00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:02.890
That was when Frank Meir,

547
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.780
who was the UFC heavyweight champion at the time,

548
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.680
got hit by a car.

549
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:06.131
He,

550
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:06.371
it's,

551
00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:07.780
they snapped his femur.

552
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.591
This guy,

553
00:16:08.591 --> 00:16:11.680
a old man ran a red light to spaced out raw,

554
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.240
just fucking nailed him,

555
00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.370
sent him flying 70 feet through the air.

556
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.750
He soared 70 feet in the air from a car and his,

557
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.500
and he's a g Frank's at giant dude and his leg snapped in half and he wasn't the

558
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:24.334
same for like,

559
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.990
like a year and a half,

560
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:26.621
two years.

561
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:28.780
Took a long time for him to recover.

562
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.460
That scared the shit out of me.

563
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.010
And then my friend Ed's and fell and just tore his shoulder up and uh,

564
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.180
he,

565
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.840
his shoulder's fucked up and you know,

566
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.280
that was it for me.

567
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.890
And then another person I know saw somebody hit,

568
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.630
I saw somebody got hit the other day.

569
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.860
I didn't see the hit,

570
00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:48.910
but I saw him after it was over and he was screaming in agony.

571
00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:50.200
Line on is on the ground.

572
00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:51.530
They had like the car beside him,

573
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.950
his bike was like,

574
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.033
ah,

575
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.023
ah

576
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:55.781
<v 0>yeah,</v>

577
00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:57.190
you hear all these things about,

578
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:57.651
I got a,

579
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.630
I got a scooter,

580
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.340
a pop around town with the scooter and the,

581
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.870
and then you start seeing stuff like this and they're like,

582
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.370
maybe we should give the scooter at rest.

583
00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:10.330
But I gotta tell you if the driver on in La and his scooters is,

584
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.750
I mean it's shave some time off and park right in.

585
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:14.921
Oh yeah.

586
00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:15.970
And bounce out.

587
00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:17.020
But uh,

588
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.531
you know,

589
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:19.180
you don't think anything's going to happen,

590
00:17:19.181 --> 00:17:22.400
but then you hear someone like this with the car jacking and then you're,

591
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.260
<v 1>so I think the best move for those things is when you're on the highway and it's</v>

592
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:31.190
bumper to bumper and those mother fuckers are cutting the lane because people at

593
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:31.790
home were,

594
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.770
I don't know where you live and you'll listen to this,

595
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:36.410
but in la for some strange reason,

596
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.170
you're allowed to drive in between cars.

597
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.010
Legally.

598
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.640
It's super fucking dangerous.

599
00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:43.490
Like when I lived in Boston,

600
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:44.450
people used to do it,

601
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:47.450
but it was illegal and people would get mad when people did it.

602
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.410
But here.

603
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.243
It's totally,

604
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:49.830
yeah.

605
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.350
I had some friends who came out and visit and one of the first things that they

606
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:52.831
said was like,

607
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:53.250
dude,

608
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.710
everybody's breaking the law on the highway.

609
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.583
The motorcycles,

610
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:55.891
Mike,

611
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:57.090
they're not like,

612
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:57.691
that's the law.

613
00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:58.501
You're allowed to do that here.

614
00:17:58.501 --> 00:17:59.600
And they just looked at me like that.

615
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.460
What was crazy when I first saw it,

616
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:02.731
I was like,

617
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:03.210
what?

618
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.620
They can almost clipped my mirror.

619
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.460
My Mirror has been clipped.

620
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.410
My Mirror is still fucked from a motorcycle guy doing really clipping my mirror.

621
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:11.244
Yeah,

622
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.821
he's lucky.

623
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:12.390
He's alive.

624
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.631
I mean,

625
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:13.291
you imagine you're,

626
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:14.560
you're fucking man.

627
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.770
Those Ducati crazy fuckers.

628
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.300
Hi Bussa dudes.

629
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.163
Yeah.

630
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.121
Yeah.

631
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:21.954
He didn't even stop.

632
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.363
I don't think he knows.

633
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.300
I was driving home from the comedy store wants and was one of those gangs of

634
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:28.134
motorcycles.

635
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.441
You know,

636
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:33.060
you get like 30 40 guys out riding and one motherfucker is doing a wheelie for

637
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.820
like a half a mile and he's going fast.

638
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:36.654
He's just

639
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.470
just to just barreling down the highway cars all around them and he's doing a

640
00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:45.260
wheelie and all I could think of was this fucking dude goes down.

641
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:47.630
He's a dead man and we're all going to see it.

642
00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:49.980
We're all going to see cars rolling over his head.

643
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.030
But my bump bump,

644
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.223
yeah,

645
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.240
I mean I guess it's exciting.

646
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:55.074
Now.

647
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.173
Must be a thrill.

648
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.541
Oh,

649
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:57.111
it's a rush.

650
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:58.940
You get that scooter up to 35.

651
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.020
See I think that that's a good idea cause I live in

652
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.150
<v 2>Burbank and that wouldn't be bad to just like go to the store,</v>

653
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.570
you know,

654
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.230
go to,

655
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.561
you know,

656
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:07.310
do little

657
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.240
<v 1>things here and there.</v>

658
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.300
You should know when those hovercrafts that got Wiz Khalifa arrested.

659
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.313
Yeah.

660
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:12.981
Can one of those things.

661
00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:13.461
I like the dude.

662
00:19:13.461 --> 00:19:13.710
How's it?

663
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.900
The store can't do it.

664
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.460
Right.

665
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.070
Those are great.

666
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.430
Hate how like just going into the bank and there's people standing on this

667
00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:21.920
things and really seen a lot of it everywhere.

668
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:23.180
Every other word you would,

669
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.450
you would drive around on those things.

670
00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.293
Okay.

671
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.940
Fuck it.

672
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.220
We'll go to Ralph's and yeah,

673
00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.213
rubber jeans,

674
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.900
your liquid,

675
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.680
your leopard nipple.

676
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.770
You tell me what you bought that shirt.

677
00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:37.580
I'll wear that.

678
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.450
That's what my new outfit,

679
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:39.860
Dat and the Hover board.

680
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.331
I think that,

681
00:19:41.331 --> 00:19:41.690
uh,

682
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.040
you know they're going to make them illegal.

683
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.361
So like right now,

684
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:46.730
like when you're driving around in a supermarket with those things,

685
00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:47.960
you can get away with it because there's no law.

686
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.970
<v 2>Did you hear what happened?</v>

687
00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:50.860
The guy that's on shark tank,

688
00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:52.930
they're the rich billionaire guy.

689
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:57.250
He actually owns the patent for all those and all those are just generic

690
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.760
replicas of the original that are sent from Korea.

691
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:05.560
So all these ones you see around or just rebranded generic like shitty once.

692
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.940
So he's going,

693
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:07.241
all right,

694
00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:08.470
everyone stop selling these.

695
00:20:08.471 --> 00:20:09.670
Now I own the patent.

696
00:20:09.671 --> 00:20:10.840
You all owe me money.

697
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:11.763
So he,

698
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:12.280
he's this,

699
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.470
he's raking it in because of those things.

700
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.351
<v 1>Oh No.</v>

701
00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:16.550
So he owns a patent.

702
00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:18.590
So he put a stop on all these people showing up.

703
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.240
<v 2>Generic ones have to stop.</v>

704
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.410
And what's probably going to happen is he's probably going to raise the price of

705
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:27.800
one because right now you can go to Amazon and buy one for $350.

706
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:31.130
So he's probably going to make that like $1,000 and only have one brand.

707
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.330
<v 1>The core,</v>

708
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.030
the Chinese are just going to sell them anyway for,

709
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.841
Ooh fuck.

710
00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:37.990
You just gotta keep looking at selling them.

711
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.470
You can stop them.

712
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.231
I mean they,

713
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:41.870
they fucking copy towns.

714
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.370
They copying tire towns.

715
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.660
They copy everything over there.

716
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:45.321
It's okay.

717
00:20:45.321 --> 00:20:46.154
It's kind of,

718
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.140
I kind of liked that,

719
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.973
do it.

720
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.491
You know,

721
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:51.490
I don't like the fact that someone's counterfeiting someone's work,

722
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.160
but I love the fact that we live in a world,

723
00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:56.590
it's so crazy that there's a part of the world where you just accept that

724
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:57.760
they're just going to copy everything.

725
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.660
They have a whole fake apple store and China total fake apple store.

726
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.640
You go in there as the apple logo.

727
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.670
All the shit is counterfeit and you never seen it before.

728
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:07.080
It's crazy.

729
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.140
It's fucking amazing.

730
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:08.710
I mean,

731
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.011
look,

732
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:09.611
if I was apple,

733
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:10.181
I'd be pissed.

734
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:12.040
But you're making plenty of money.

735
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.840
You should be laughing.

736
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.800
You should be laughing at the fact that this exists.

737
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:15.521
I mean,

738
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:16.301
if it sucks,

739
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:17.530
if you're in China and you want it,

740
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:17.951
oh look,

741
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:19.720
I'll just go to the apple store and get my,

742
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.130
how come it doesn't have what?

743
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.950
Why does it have a USB board and the bottom of the iPhone?

744
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:25.030
Like what is like,

745
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:26.380
they just make their own shit.

746
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.540
Just slap an apple logo on it.

747
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.040
Yeah.

748
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.210
They don't give a fuck man.

749
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:32.590
They copy entire cities.

750
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.600
There's an exact replica of Paris in China down to every street.

751
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.351
Yeah.

752
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:39.280
They have an Eiffel tower.

753
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.980
They've got no originality there.

754
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.863
Nothing.

755
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.930
No one's looking at their city and going,

756
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:44.764
let's uh,

757
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.790
it's be unique here.

758
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.083
I don't know,

759
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.790
you got a wonder.

760
00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:50.110
I mean I'm not a sociologist.

761
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:53.500
You've got to wonder like what is it about certain cultures that promotes

762
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:54.130
creativity?

763
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.240
Like obviously America,

764
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.420
like America is known for being a very creative part of the country.

765
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.940
And if you look at like African Americans,

766
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.640
African Americans are known as being like some of the most creative and

767
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:07.480
innovative people as far as like co culture as far as like the way they dress

768
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:08.314
and the way they talk.

769
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.820
They like the most imitated,

770
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.301
you know,

771
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:11.110
like they're like,

772
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.491
they're,

773
00:22:11.491 --> 00:22:12.850
they're pushing music.

774
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:13.271
Like,

775
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:15.250
think about like Chuck Berry,

776
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.510
Jimi Hendrix,

777
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:16.721
you know,

778
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:18.580
like go back to like the old days of rock and roll,

779
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:19.414
James Brown,

780
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.530
all these black eyes,

781
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:21.670
he's white guys were like,

782
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:22.001
fuck,

783
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:22.990
we had to do what they're doing.

784
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.700
Like Jimi Hendrix.

785
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:25.720
Like when they came along,

786
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:26.860
the Beatles watched him and they're like,

787
00:22:26.861 --> 00:22:28.180
we got to fucking quit music.

788
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:28.601
Like,

789
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:29.434
what are we doing?

790
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.340
Like this fucking,

791
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.360
what is this guy doing?

792
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.361
Everybody was like,

793
00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:35.260
Jesus Christ.

794
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.680
And what is it that makes them like that?

795
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:39.161
You know,

796
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:42.820
what is it that makes America like a hub of innovation?

797
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.860
There's some innovative places in the world,

798
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.941
but this spot,

799
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:47.530
especially when it comes to art,

800
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.870
like when it comes to standup comedy,

801
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.061
well,

802
00:22:50.061 --> 00:22:50.650
we do,

803
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:50.861
yeah.

804
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:51.370
Why?

805
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.121
Why are,

806
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:55.770
why go to Germany or Australia that,

807
00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:56.490
uh,

808
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:57.760
no one's pumping out movies.

809
00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:58.810
TV shows like,

810
00:22:58.811 --> 00:22:59.080
uh,

811
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.150
like America does a little bit and they,

812
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:01.920
they produce like,

813
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.230
look,

814
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.711
good cop.

815
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:04.360
Like Jim Jefferies came from Australia.

816
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.470
He's a great comic.

817
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.330
They've got some really funny guys over there.

818
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.140
Um,

819
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.010
there's some real good logo comics and they make some good movies and stuff like

820
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:12.221
that.

821
00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:13.840
But there's not that many people in Australia.

822
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.560
Australia is a giant place and it's got as many people as la.

823
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.740
Yeah,

824
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:18.960
I,

825
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.381
I'm not,

826
00:23:19.381 --> 00:23:19.690
I'm,

827
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.420
I was just saying in regards to entertainment,

828
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.520
yeah.

829
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.221
As a whole,

830
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:27.210
America seems to have that kind of unlocked down.

831
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.330
We've got it on fleek.

832
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.921
Yeah.

833
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:30.311
I don't know,

834
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:30.610
man.

835
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.300
It's weird.

836
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.770
Like Germany not good at all.

837
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:34.690
Like Germany's real stiff to Brian.

838
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:36.550
Were you around when that guy was coming to the store?

839
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.900
Were you around when that guy was coming to stores?

840
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.240
All guy from Germany with the hair?

841
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.853
What's his name?

842
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.240
Oh,

843
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:43.661
no,

844
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:44.660
I don't know if Marie boss,

845
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.231
no,

846
00:23:45.231 --> 00:23:45.471
no,

847
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:45.651
no,

848
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:45.831
no,

849
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:45.981
no.

850
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:46.940
He was a really,

851
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
really popular guy in Germany and he had decided that he was going to make it in

852
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.720
America and I mean,

853
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:55.050
he barely spoke English.

854
00:23:55.051 --> 00:23:55.371
God,

855
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:55.851
yeah.

856
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.910
I came with a z doing juggling.

857
00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.220
He was,

858
00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.330
had a suit on.

859
00:23:59.410 --> 00:23:59.890
Uh,

860
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:00.770
I forget his name.

861
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.791
I forget his name too,

862
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:02.690
but we were all like,

863
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:03.230
what?

864
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.441
Like,

865
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:04.370
what is this guy doing?

866
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.750
Like it was interesting because we kind of like respected the fact this guy had

867
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:09.560
the balls.

868
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.500
He realized that like for Standup Comedians,

869
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:14.090
like when I was living in Boston,

870
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:15.660
we would all hear about the comedy store.

871
00:24:15.661 --> 00:24:16.610
It was like Mecca.

872
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.980
It was always spoken about in hush tones.

873
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:20.600
Like you got to go to the comedy store.

874
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:21.950
That's where prior started out.

875
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.780
That's where Ken is in,

876
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.290
started out and everybody was like,

877
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:24.621
Oh,

878
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:25.760
the comedy store with the comedy store.

879
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.721
And then you know,

880
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:28.490
you get there and you'd see fucking James Stevens,

881
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:30.590
the third asking for a standing ovation.

882
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:30.771
You're like,

883
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:32.080
what the fuck is going on here?

884
00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:34.940
Like singing wizard of Oz songs and shit.

885
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:38.150
Like it was a dark time in the nineties it was like we had missed the Kinison

886
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:41.900
wave and you know when you and I were first starting at the store,

887
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:43.250
I was a few years before you,

888
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:43.461
I was,

889
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:46.490
I started in 94 I'm at the store and it was just like,

890
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:46.821
Whoa,

891
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:47.810
this place is dark.

892
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.090
Like it was gross.

893
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.120
It was like a lot of lot of bad comedy going on their bed.

894
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.080
But this fucking dude decided,

895
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:54.650
hey,

896
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:54.891
you know,

897
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:57.560
I'm a big star in Germany but I'm going to come to America.

898
00:24:57.561 --> 00:24:58.470
I'm going to try to make it,

899
00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.750
didn't even speak English.

900
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.770
Frank Lumberman.

901
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.310
That's his,

902
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.000
that's his name.

903
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.870
Frank Lumberman.

904
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.380
Yeah.

905
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.213
Nice guy.

906
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.040
Real Nice Guy.

907
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.873
Just didn't work.

908
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.830
He just,

909
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.720
his comedy was like slap sticky like Charlie Chaplin movie type Shit.

910
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.330
Like you would fall down and fucking,

911
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.010
he didn't know what was going on.

912
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.260
I went on stage and it was like,

913
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.850
he was like the,

914
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:26.900
I think you had a talk show in Germany and came here and he tried to make it

915
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:30.420
work and it's amazing how many people come in and out of that comedy stuff.

916
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:30.710
You,

917
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.680
if you went back and looked at the people that came in and they stayed for a

918
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:34.100
little bit,

919
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.860
they left and so it was,

920
00:25:36.861 --> 00:25:36.940
yeah,

921
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.840
<v 2>the names on the walls.</v>

922
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.710
Sometimes I'll just sit there with Google open and just Google people's names on

923
00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:42.280
the walls.

924
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:42.821
Have them.

925
00:25:42.821 --> 00:25:44.470
I can't even find on Google,

926
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.500
like there's like some guy named Mc Ren or something like or mc Zen and he's

927
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.300
like,

928
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.900
well that's a weird name for a comic.

929
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.070
So nothing about him.

930
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.250
There's some towing truck company on the side of the law.

931
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.300
Have you ever looked at the wall?

932
00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.230
There's like a lot of names.

933
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.420
I think people just put up there without them knowing.

934
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.300
<v 1>It's like with doctors,</v>

935
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:04.811
they're like,

936
00:26:04.811 --> 00:26:05.800
there's like doctors,

937
00:26:05.801 --> 00:26:07.240
like whatever happened to Mike,

938
00:26:07.241 --> 00:26:08.200
the ophthalmologist.

939
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:08.560
Ah,

940
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.270
I'm just not doing it anymore.

941
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:10.781
You know?

942
00:26:10.781 --> 00:26:11.650
Like does that happen?

943
00:26:11.651 --> 00:26:15.040
Like they go to the ophthalmologist conventions and just quit.

944
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.903
He just quit.

945
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.290
Like probably not as much.

946
00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:17.471
Right.

947
00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:19.830
They get saddled with all these bills and you know,

948
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.460
there's no student loans for comedians.

949
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.571
I don't think.

950
00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:25.580
I've never seen a guy or met a guy that used to,

951
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.760
used to do a medical stuff.

952
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.320
I ran into a guy at the improv there the night that was an open mic or when I

953
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:35.410
was an open miker and from Boston and he just decided,

954
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:35.801
he goes,

955
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:36.161
yeah,

956
00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:37.540
I haven't done comedy at all.

957
00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:39.370
I haven't been on stage 16 years,

958
00:26:39.371 --> 00:26:40.570
but I thought about it all the time.

959
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.040
I decided to come back.

960
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:42.850
Wow.

961
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:43.140
What,

962
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.381
you know,

963
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:44.340
how do I get spots?

964
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:46.900
Like he's fucking ran away with that.

965
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.830
We can't even,

966
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.581
this is a conversation,

967
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:51.450
how do I speak English?

968
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:52.620
Where you gotta start with the alphabet?

969
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.150
Fuck man.

970
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.630
Like look,

971
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.000
look,

972
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.280
even say to a guy like that,

973
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.840
go go to kill Tony.

974
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.890
Yeah.

975
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.590
He's got an advantage over someone who hasn't done it at all.

976
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.840
And there are people that start deep in their forties me,

977
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.080
there's no age limit.

978
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.560
No,

979
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.880
you could be a great comic.

980
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:11.190
You could start when you're 50 and become a great comic.

981
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.650
You just have to be willing to put in that time.

982
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.910
You have to have that energy.

983
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.020
Yeah.

984
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.720
<v 0>Mean it's going to take some time.</v>

985
00:27:17.721 --> 00:27:22.640
I mean like when do you think you guys started feeling comfortable in your own

986
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.410
skin and and on stage?

987
00:27:24.411 --> 00:27:25.400
Was that something that

988
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.890
<v 1>I think I might have figured it out for an hour.</v>

989
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.410
I think like there's a time low chain,

990
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.970
I think 10 years in.

991
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.250
Yeah,

992
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.470
I think 10 years or the number.

993
00:27:39.471 --> 00:27:41.510
So you probably started right when I was,

994
00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:42.890
I was 10 years in when you started.

995
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.270
So you started in [inaudible] 98.

996
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.260
I started in [inaudible] 88.

997
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:45.950
Oh Wow.

998
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:46.761
So when you saw me,

999
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:47.594
I was just,

1000
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.680
just kind of,

1001
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.690
I could really do an hour.

1002
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.510
I could really go on the road and I could do an hour and I had a special,

1003
00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:54.860
then I had my first,

1004
00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:55.100
uh,

1005
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.050
comedy set or a Warner brothers CD.

1006
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.520
Then I put out and,

1007
00:27:58.521 --> 00:27:58.890
uh,

1008
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.160
I felt like I could do comedy.

1009
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.611
You know,

1010
00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:03.440
I felt like it wasn't a fraud anymore,

1011
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.190
you know,

1012
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.023
but it still didn't,

1013
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.400
like if someone was gonna come see me that I liked,

1014
00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:08.150
I'd panic.

1015
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:08.900
Ooh.

1016
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.733
You know?

1017
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.360
Yeah.

1018
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.280
Fuck someone famous that you like,

1019
00:28:13.281 --> 00:28:14.060
come see you.

1020
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.170
Oh No.

1021
00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:16.004
Stay home.

1022
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.830
Let me go on stage with no pressure.

1023
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:19.551
You know,

1024
00:28:19.551 --> 00:28:20.900
it takes fucking forever,

1025
00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:21.340
man.

1026
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.173
It takes forever.

1027
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.590
So he's one of the most brutal grinds and all of Showbiz.

1028
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.500
It is a brutal grind.

1030
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:27.951
And,

1031
00:28:27.951 --> 00:28:28.131
uh,

1032
00:28:28.131 --> 00:28:30.650
you mentioned someone when someone's famous in the crowd,

1033
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.810
even when you're in the crowd though,

1034
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:33.760
anywhere at the Er,

1035
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.610
we were in the crowd.

1036
00:28:34.611 --> 00:28:35.210
Uh,

1037
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.440
and I know your laugh,

1038
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.130
I know your left and you're laughing at other comedians.

1039
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.480
So when I'm on stage,

1040
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.260
um,

1041
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.700
I'm listening for a Joe Rogan

1042
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.781
<v 1>eight minutes in,</v>

1043
00:28:47.781 --> 00:28:47.991
I'm like,

1044
00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:48.824
this guy's not live.

1045
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.610
I was laughing at you the other day,

1046
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.543
but I

1047
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.820
<v 0>listen to certain things in the room.</v>

1048
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.413
<v 1>I mean,</v>

1049
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.320
you don't do,

1050
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:04.530
you don't hear like you're trying to make somebody laugh.

1051
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.110
There's not people like you hear Joey Diaz laugh.

1052
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.680
Yeah,

1053
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.420
I remember to this day one of them,

1054
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.231
like when I was like,

1055
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:10.621
well,

1056
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:11.730
I'm a fucking comedian.

1057
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.380
So when Paul Mooney was laughing,

1058
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.810
Paul Mooney when I first started fucking treated me like I was the plague,

1059
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.501
you know,

1060
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:23.400
some cute little white boy on some stupid sitcom trying to make it at the comedy

1061
00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:23.531
store.

1062
00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:24.720
I was a non paid regular.

1063
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.171
I mean,

1064
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:25.950
I said hello,

1065
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:26.501
Hello Mr Man.

1066
00:29:26.501 --> 00:29:27.960
Woody preterm walked right by me.

1067
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:28.794
Like I was on fire.

1068
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.480
I didn't give a fuck.

1069
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.280
And then one night I was,

1070
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.790
I was doing a set of late at,

1071
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.720
and it was like fucking 20 people in the audience.

1072
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.400
But,

1073
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:37.680
uh,

1074
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.360
I used to do those sets.

1075
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.740
Like the place is packed,

1076
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:41.200
you know,

1077
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.570
I didn't,

1078
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.150
I don't believe in throwing away a set,

1079
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:43.740
you know,

1080
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.010
if I'm going to do a set,

1081
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.420
I try my best.

1082
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.643
And uh,

1083
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.483
I heard,

1084
00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.650
<v 0>which is Moody's lap.</v>

1085
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.170
Oh,

1086
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.780
<v 1>I forget what the bit was.</v>

1087
00:29:54.781 --> 00:29:56.130
I really wish I remembered what the bit,

1088
00:29:56.131 --> 00:29:56.461
what is it?

1089
00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:57.181
Controversial.

1090
00:29:57.181 --> 00:29:57.441
Bitter.

1091
00:29:57.441 --> 00:30:02.400
I remember that it was a fucked up bit and I came offstage and Mooney fucking

1092
00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:04.680
grabbed me by both shoulders and said,

1093
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.910
you're a real comic.

1094
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.150
You are a real come.

1095
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:09.810
You did that set in front of those 20 people.

1096
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.030
Like there was a thousand motherfuckers in that room.

1097
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.050
You're a real comic.

1098
00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:13.980
And I was like,

1099
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.813
wow.

1100
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.930
I remember how good that feels.

1101
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.880
Like hearing him laugh was like,

1102
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:18.743
wow,

1103
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.130
Paul Mooney thinks I'm funny.

1104
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:20.710
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.931
It's,

1106
00:30:20.931 --> 00:30:23.770
it's nice to hear other comedians laugh at your stuff.

1107
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:23.960
That's,

1108
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.190
oh,

1109
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.971
it's giant.

1110
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:27.340
It's like you could have 300 strangers laugh,

1111
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.310
but you hear a one comedian lamping like I'm in the group.

1112
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.213
Yeah.

1113
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.960
<v 1>Diaz was in the back of the comedy store the other night.</v>

1114
00:30:32.961 --> 00:30:35.500
Fucking Howlin when he's Howard.

1115
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:35.750
Yeah.

1116
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.583
<v 4>Ah,</v>

1117
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.890
<v 1>you're that fucking bellowing lap and d as is always smacking things,</v>

1118
00:30:40.891 --> 00:30:42.560
smack and people and he's laughing.

1119
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.030
Smacking tables.

1120
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.693
Yeah,

1121
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.510
I saw your special,

1122
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.840
your sh you showtime specials.

1123
00:30:48.841 --> 00:30:49.581
The showtime special.

1124
00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:49.910
Yeah,

1125
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:50.900
I was on a,

1126
00:30:50.901 --> 00:30:51.734
on the road,

1127
00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.660
I forget where it was.

1128
00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:53.900
Just was flipping through the channels.

1129
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.670
I think it was in Vegas actually,

1130
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.570
and it was just,

1131
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.080
you know,

1132
00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.840
after show bored watching TV and you,

1133
00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:00.141
your,

1134
00:31:00.141 --> 00:31:03.680
your special came on and I hadn't seen you do a set because I hadn't been at the

1135
00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:06.230
store in like six or seven years.

1136
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:06.530
Just,

1137
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:06.741
you know,

1138
00:31:06.741 --> 00:31:08.300
2007 was when I quit.

1139
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.250
And,

1140
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:09.500
um,

1141
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.070
this was,

1142
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.341
you know,

1143
00:31:10.341 --> 00:31:10.990
maybe what,

1144
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.511
two years ago,

1145
00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:12.344
when was your special?

1146
00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.431
Two years ago.

1147
00:31:13.431 --> 00:31:15.860
2012 fucking excellent.

1148
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.970
That was really,

1149
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:17.840
really good.

1150
00:31:17.841 --> 00:31:18.170
Thank you.

1151
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.310
It was tight.

1152
00:31:19.311 --> 00:31:20.480
It was funny.

1153
00:31:20.481 --> 00:31:22.610
You were comfortable up there and I was like,

1154
00:31:22.611 --> 00:31:23.331
God damn,

1155
00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:24.860
I haven't seen Sebastian a long time.

1156
00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:25.790
You were fucking killing it,

1157
00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:26.060
right?

1158
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.411
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:28.900
And when you tweeted at me and the message of it's like,

1160
00:31:28.901 --> 00:31:29.081
wow,

1161
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:29.441
that's,

1162
00:31:29.441 --> 00:31:29.981
that's nice.

1163
00:31:29.981 --> 00:31:33.220
Because I always thought at the comedy store when you were there,

1164
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:33.341
I,

1165
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:33.790
I,

1166
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.310
I don't know.

1167
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.660
I for some reason I don't think you got what I was doing.

1168
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:38.441
I don't blame you.

1169
00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:39.390
What the Nymph wasn't sure.

1170
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:41.771
Well,

1171
00:31:41.771 --> 00:31:42.760
we were always friendly.

1172
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.140
I know we were always friendly,

1173
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.870
but for whatever the reason we weren't like,

1174
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:47.704
uh,

1175
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.690
whenever like hanging out there,

1176
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:51.370
I was kind of in my own little world.

1177
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.010
And in your own little world with everybody though,

1178
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.860
you kind of would go there and do your shit and then get out of it.

1179
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:57.000
Yeah,

1180
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.611
I was kind of,

1181
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:58.900
I never really hung out.

1182
00:31:58.901 --> 00:31:59.501
I did,

1183
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:03.370
but I didn't end there was like you had that little cluster of people in the

1184
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.204
back there,

1185
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.870
which I never kind of got into that little circle.

1186
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.180
It's just one of these guys.

1187
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.850
I've always been the Guy Kinda on the outskirts,

1188
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.830
even in school and whatever.

1189
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:16.870
I was always kind of the quiet kid that,

1190
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.070
you know,

1191
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.903
the shirts,

1192
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:20.081
shirts,

1193
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:21.040
the shirts,

1194
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.243
open nipples,

1195
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:27.150
nipples,

1196
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:27.950
shirts.

1197
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:28.181
Yeah,

1198
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:28.361
no,

1199
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:30.160
I was always kind of on the outskirts.

1200
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:30.851
So anyway,

1201
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:33.520
that's a fast forward when you said that you really enjoy what I was doing.

1202
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:33.821
I was like,

1203
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:34.031
wow,

1204
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:34.271
that's,

1205
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:34.940
that's a nice car.

1206
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1207
00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:35.890
I sent out,

1208
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:37.850
there was a tweet I put out run like a few years ago.

1209
00:32:37.851 --> 00:32:39.440
Like right after I saw it I put out.

1210
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.460
But yeah,

1211
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.230
when I saw you at the comedy store the other night too,

1212
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:42.830
I was noticing,

1213
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.131
I was like,

1214
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:44.990
he's so comfortable on stage now.

1215
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:46.760
Like you're so you're so like,

1216
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:47.180
uh,

1217
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.170
in your own,

1218
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.270
your own rhythm,

1219
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.840
you know,

1220
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.050
which is like one of the harder things for comedian to find,

1221
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:55.850
like find your own rhythm.

1222
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.960
Like you could say the same stuff year after year after year and just not good.

1223
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.900
And then one day you figure out how to do it.

1224
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:06.490
You figure out how it gels in people's minds and then,

1225
00:33:06.491 --> 00:33:07.140
yeah,

1226
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:07.830
<v 0>that's it.</v>

1227
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.071
Yeah,

1228
00:33:08.071 --> 00:33:08.521
you're right.

1229
00:33:08.521 --> 00:33:08.941
It's just,

1230
00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:09.201
it's,

1231
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:10.600
it's a dance up there.

1232
00:33:10.601 --> 00:33:11.940
And I think that you were doing about it,

1233
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.750
<v 1>kid,</v>

1234
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.480
about the kid that you just really didn't like.

1235
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:16.471
I don't want to,

1236
00:33:16.471 --> 00:33:17.490
I want to give away the bit.

1237
00:33:17.491 --> 00:33:17.640
Okay.

1238
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.770
<v 0>Was it the getting slapped in the back of the neck?</v>

1239
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.200
The thing about that you,

1240
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:23.360
you ran into a kid at a party and you're like,

1241
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.540
I'm just not into this kid

1242
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.070
is great cause it was like

1243
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:30.580
<v 1>the,</v>

1244
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.020
it's one of those co it was like,

1245
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.801
I don't want to give it away,

1246
00:33:32.801 --> 00:33:37.801
but it's one of those bits where it's dependent upon your rhythm and everyone

1247
00:33:38.081 --> 00:33:39.880
understanding how you look at things,

1248
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:40.830
you know?

1249
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:41.011
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:33:41.011 --> 00:33:41.844
It's not real.

1251
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.500
It's a combination of things.

1252
00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:47.220
I mean you got people that writing beautiful jokes and this and that.

1253
00:33:47.221 --> 00:33:47.761
And the other thing,

1254
00:33:47.761 --> 00:33:49.110
I really admire those people,

1255
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:54.111
but the way I work is it's more of like a way you say something or the timing or

1256
00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:56.490
a pause or a look and it,

1257
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.830
it Kinda all gels together for some reason.

1258
00:33:58.831 --> 00:33:59.101
And,

1259
00:33:59.101 --> 00:33:59.934
uh,

1260
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.540
and that's what I noticed that people were kind of gravitating towards watching

1261
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.710
my act was all this kind of physical and all this kind of like kind of weird

1262
00:34:07.711 --> 00:34:08.750
faces that,

1263
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.230
uh,

1264
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.480
you know,

1265
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.100
some other people might look at like this.

1266
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.350
It's funny that the kind of stolen all these faces or whatnot,

1267
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:15.811
but I don't know,

1268
00:34:15.811 --> 00:34:18.540
I've always been in a very expressive family.

1269
00:34:18.541 --> 00:34:20.070
So when we sat around the table,

1270
00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:24.030
which seemed to be kind of my first stage growing up in this Italian household

1271
00:34:24.031 --> 00:34:28.410
and everybody was kind of telling stories and we all kind of just,

1272
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.130
it was,

1273
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.310
everybody was kind of funny and we never really got serious.

1274
00:34:32.311 --> 00:34:33.480
Cause if we got serious,

1275
00:34:33.481 --> 00:34:34.650
we would start to cry.

1276
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.500
Very emotional family who's either,

1277
00:34:37.501 --> 00:34:38.700
we were laughing or crying.

1278
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:39.630
It was no in between.

1279
00:34:39.631 --> 00:34:41.100
That's Italian is Italian.

1280
00:34:41.101 --> 00:34:41.611
So,

1281
00:34:41.611 --> 00:34:42.330
uh,

1282
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:42.661
yeah.

1283
00:34:42.661 --> 00:34:42.940
And,

1284
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.940
and it took a while to kind of find that rhythm.

1285
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:45.671
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:34:45.671 --> 00:34:46.600
It's an interesting thing,

1287
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:46.931
isn't it?

1288
00:34:46.931 --> 00:34:48.730
Everybody's got their own rhythm and you,

1289
00:34:48.731 --> 00:34:49.450
you really,

1290
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:50.283
you can't,

1291
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.550
we can't predict it.

1292
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.830
Like I always use Mitch Hedberg as an example.

1293
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.251
Like,

1294
00:34:54.251 --> 00:34:54.701
if you,

1295
00:34:54.701 --> 00:34:56.170
if you ever saw Hedberg live,

1296
00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:00.820
like Hedberg would say things that on paper we're not funny at all.

1297
00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.500
What you would be howling.

1298
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.250
Like he had that bit about the doubletree,

1299
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.560
like naming the doubletree in like how,

1300
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:07.540
how did they name that?

1301
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.230
You know,

1302
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.610
how about three trees?

1303
00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.563
No.

1304
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.403
Doubletree.

1305
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.160
Yes,

1306
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.210
the meeting adjourned.

1307
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.210
I'm not doing the bit justice,

1308
00:35:16.211 --> 00:35:18.310
but like he had a bunch of bits like that.

1309
00:35:18.311 --> 00:35:19.360
Like would you like,

1310
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.010
would you like a frozen banana?

1311
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:21.640
No,

1312
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.680
but I like a regular banana later.

1313
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.760
So yes,

1314
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.270
it's so ridiculous.

1315
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.780
But if you saw that on paper you would go,

1316
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:32.614
that's not really funny.

1317
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.230
But then you go see him live and you're dying.

1318
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.280
To this day if bored and I'm in my car,

1319
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.140
I have a playlist on my,

1320
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:40.470
uh,

1321
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.940
my iPhone where I have some standup on it and I'll go to that Hedburg CD.

1322
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:45.680
To this day,

1323
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:45.990
you know,

1324
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.760
I've heard it all a hundred times.

1325
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.780
It's squeaky clean,

1326
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.150
squeaky clean and fucking killer.

1327
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.801
But this is like,

1328
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:53.700
he found his style.

1329
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:54.570
He found his rhythm,

1330
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:55.230
you know,

1331
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.660
you got to find whatever it is and no one can tell you,

1332
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.470
you know,

1333
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.730
that's why comedy classes or just kind of ridiculous shit.

1334
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:02.580
Joe,

1335
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.570
I took a comedy class.

1336
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:03.830
Well,

1337
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.350
it's good to get you on stage.

1338
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.793
Who taught it?

1339
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.170
I took a car,

1340
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:08.761
this is my,

1341
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:09.240
uh,

1342
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.660
another introduction until Los Angeles never did comedy before,

1343
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:13.470
but once,

1344
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.861
so I go,

1345
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:16.080
how am I going to get in to the comedy store?

1346
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.820
I heard the comedy store was the place to be.

1347
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.773
So I looked through the,

1348
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.130
whatever the trades.

1349
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.540
Sandy shore,

1350
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.340
who's Mitzi shores,

1351
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:28.341
daughter has a thing called sandy shores sandbox comedy class.

1352
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:30.144
So I'm thinking,

1353
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.983
perfect.

1354
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.270
I take her class.

1355
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:34.770
If she likes me,

1356
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:39.771
she tells the mother I'm in sort of stay sandy shores,

1357
00:36:40.711 --> 00:36:41.101
like,

1358
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:41.880
uh,

1359
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.713
just so you know,

1360
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.040
I don't really get along with my mother.

1361
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:45.330
We're not really talking right now.

1362
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:45.751
And I'm like,

1363
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:45.990
yeah,

1364
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.970
that's $400 down the drain.

1365
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:49.950
But uh,

1366
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:50.970
for me,

1367
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:56.510
I enjoyed the comedy class because it gave me an opportunity to go up once a

1368
00:36:57.121 --> 00:36:59.490
week in front of a supportive environment.

1369
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.050
Say what you will about that,

1370
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.591
you know,

1371
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:03.510
I mean the people that are there and support,

1372
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.710
oh that was good.

1373
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.320
You know,

1374
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.690
not going out into the wolves.

1375
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.050
But for me it was like a way to kind of just get my legs a little bit.

1376
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:14.280
So I took it for for six months and it kind of helped me get off the ground a

1377
00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:15.450
little bit because I didn't know,

1378
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.380
I didn't know what to do.

1379
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.340
Nothing wrong with that.

1380
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.530
I mean that's a great way to start really.

1381
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:19.981
You know,

1382
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:21.440
it's just no one could teach you how to do comps.

1383
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.140
Oh No,

1384
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.180
I've got to kind of figure out how to do it on your own.

1385
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.200
Like I've seen comedy classes where they,

1386
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:26.401
you know,

1387
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:27.660
they give people bad advice,

1388
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:28.350
dealt with a talent.

1389
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:28.941
Somebody like,

1390
00:37:28.941 --> 00:37:29.774
you know,

1391
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.680
worst is like club owners.

1392
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.900
Like Jamie Masada told my friend Todd wants,

1393
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.240
you have to be generation x guy,

1394
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.471
you and a Janet,

1395
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:37.830
Aisha,

1396
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.311
next guy.

1397
00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:39.540
When you go on stage,

1398
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.350
what you going to do is only talk about generation x,

1399
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.630
my generation,

1400
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.780
generation x,

1401
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.790
we think this and you do the and,

1402
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.260
and the kid was like,

1403
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:49.591
fuck,

1404
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:50.221
do I have to do this?

1405
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:51.270
Like if I don't do this,

1406
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:52.600
this guy's not gonna let me get on stage.

1407
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.860
Like the worst fucking possible advice.

1408
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.251
You know,

1409
00:37:56.251 --> 00:38:00.280
like who's going to make it with the generation x guy fucking how long is that

1410
00:38:00.281 --> 00:38:00.930
going to lie?

1411
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.370
Yeah.

1412
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.660
<v 2>He told Tony that he,</v>

1413
00:38:02.661 --> 00:38:03.111
he's like,

1414
00:38:03.111 --> 00:38:03.441
Tony,

1415
00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:05.780
you need to wear a cowboy hat.

1416
00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:07.010
Do you wear a cowboy hat?

1417
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.570
You look like woody from toy story.

1418
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.640
Fuck Shit.

1419
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.513
Again,

1420
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.950
Guy owns a comedy club.

1421
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1422
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.030
And when you find out that he's the guy that introduced Michael Jackson,

1423
00:38:19.031 --> 00:38:20.840
it was kids he molested allegedly.

1424
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:21.950
Oh yeah.

1425
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.790
Cause he used to,

1426
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.860
he used to work with all those like dying kids.

1427
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.700
Yeah.

1428
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:25.851
Yeah.

1429
00:38:25.851 --> 00:38:27.530
Unfortunately it's the in between guy.

1430
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:28.600
Here's the fucking,

1431
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.570
this is Corey Feldman.

1432
00:38:29.571 --> 00:38:29.981
Tight ties.

1433
00:38:29.981 --> 00:38:30.814
Hello.

1434
00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.420
I don't think he said that.

1435
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.090
I don't think you get introduced into Corey Feldman.

1436
00:38:36.091 --> 00:38:36.924
Anita.

1437
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.130
Corey Feldman wasn't dying of a disease as far as I know.

1438
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.833
I'm sure.

1439
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:41.783
Hmm.

1440
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.753
Um,

1441
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.260
but now you're,

1442
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.210
you're fucking Torin.

1443
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.061
You're doing the road,

1444
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:46.900
you're killing it everywhere.

1445
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:47.180
I see.

1446
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:47.591
Everywhere,

1447
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:48.424
everywhere I'm at.

1448
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.600
Improv's all that shit.

1449
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:50.240
You're doing great.

1450
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.511
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1451
00:38:50.511 --> 00:38:51.141
Knock on wood.

1452
00:38:51.141 --> 00:38:51.711
It's been good.

1453
00:38:51.711 --> 00:38:52.401
It's been good.

1454
00:38:52.401 --> 00:38:55.520
Kind of getting myself involved with the clubs.

1455
00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:57.350
And did you start out at the store?

1456
00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.930
You started out in la or out in Los Angeles?

1457
00:38:59.931 --> 00:39:03.230
1998 I did comedy at my college.

1458
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.980
I went to Northern Illinois University in Dekalb and they had like a comedy

1459
00:39:06.981 --> 00:39:11.450
contest where you auditioned in front of like the student council and then I got

1460
00:39:11.451 --> 00:39:14.210
to open up for the national headline and comedian.

1461
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:15.853
Who was that?

1462
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.380
Reese.

1463
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:17.841
Uh,

1464
00:39:17.841 --> 00:39:18.470
what's his name?

1465
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.640
His last name was Reese.

1466
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.180
Forgot.

1467
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.110
He used to do this thing with the used to go up on stage and goal

1468
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.360
<v 1>or,</v>

1469
00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:24.751
I dunno,

1470
00:39:24.751 --> 00:39:26.580
it was like a

1471
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.531
growl.

1472
00:39:30.531 --> 00:39:31.350
I don't know.

1473
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.790
That was his like moniker.

1474
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.561
<v 0>So,</v>

1475
00:39:33.561 --> 00:39:33.890
uh,

1476
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:34.240
yeah,

1477
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.570
he was the guy.

1478
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.870
So I go on stage just as in like,

1479
00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.111
you know,

1480
00:39:39.111 --> 00:39:40.130
like a college,

1481
00:39:40.131 --> 00:39:43.460
400 cedar or it's like a free show for the students,

1482
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.350
primarily a black crowd.

1483
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.680
I go on stage and I start to do my act and I'm starting to hear sad man.

1484
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.190
I didn't know what the Hell Sandman was at the time,

1485
00:39:55.191 --> 00:39:58.250
but I found out later at showtime at the Apollo,

1486
00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.120
that's what they call when they want the guy to come out with the hook,

1487
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.690
the sand.

1488
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.931
Oh,

1489
00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:03.060
oh

1490
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:03.840
<v 1>no.</v>

1491
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.673
But I'm like,

1492
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.740
I'm going through this.

1493
00:40:05.741 --> 00:40:06.574
It's gone.

1494
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.400
He said,

1495
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.233
what is,

1496
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.860
is there another guy coming out?

1497
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:11.820
What does Sandman,

1498
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.830
so it was bad.

1499
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.210
It was a bad experience,

1500
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.950
but I knew,

1501
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.330
I just knew I had an ability to make people have maybe not yet on stage.

1502
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.090
It was primarily based on my family.

1503
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.950
If I was making my family laugh,

1504
00:40:25.951 --> 00:40:27.210
particularly my mother,

1505
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.740
if she was laughing,

1506
00:40:28.741 --> 00:40:31.740
I knew that I had some ability to make people laugh.

1507
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:34.020
It was just kind of trying to find it on stage.

1508
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.970
It's a weird fucking journey,

1509
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.600
you know?

1510
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.100
It's a very weird journey.

1511
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.340
The journey of trying to figure out what it is and how to do it,

1512
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.393
which way to go,

1513
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.170
you know,

1514
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.940
and you can go the wrong way for a long time.

1515
00:40:44.941 --> 00:40:45.960
Then you have to bring it back.

1516
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:46.531
You know,

1517
00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:49.650
like there's guys that create characters like emo Phillips,

1518
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:50.731
you know,

1519
00:40:50.731 --> 00:40:51.030
he,

1520
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.500
he have this character,

1521
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.820
you're what do on,

1522
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.900
which is great until you're 60 which he is now.

1523
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.930
He's like an old dude and now he can't do that character anymore.

1524
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.770
So you go to see emo Phillips if like you were a fan of his and the eighties and

1525
00:41:04.771 --> 00:41:04.981
they're like,

1526
00:41:04.981 --> 00:41:05.131
yeah,

1527
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:07.500
we're going to go see email and you see him now and you're like,

1528
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.353
um,

1529
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:09.661
what's going on?

1530
00:41:09.661 --> 00:41:12.930
Like he's just talking like he's not doing the character thing.

1531
00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:16.040
Like I'm surprised it's still works on dice because it,

1532
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.490
it doesn't seem like it should,

1533
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.190
but it does.

1534
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.540
Cogs,

1535
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.231
it's universal.

1536
00:41:19.231 --> 00:41:21.120
It's still work that will last forever.

1537
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.321
That will last forever.

1538
00:41:22.321 --> 00:41:23.100
You know why?

1539
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.540
Because he has become that guy.

1540
00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.220
Yeah.

1541
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:25.480
Oh yeah.

1542
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.313
He's the guy.

1543
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.420
He's that guy.

1544
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.261
He does it.

1545
00:41:28.261 --> 00:41:29.094
You know,

1546
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:33.090
if anybody saw him in the early days when he was Andrew Silverstein,

1547
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.060
the dice character was one of the guys that he would do in his act.

1548
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:39.200
He had a bunch of characters.

1549
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.250
He would do John Travolta.

1550
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.230
He does an incredible John Travolta impression.

1551
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.490
He would do all these things.

1552
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:44.324
He would sing,

1553
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.570
he would have all these different like pieces of his act and then he would do

1554
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:52.571
the dice man and the dice man was based apparently on the nutty professor with

1555
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:55.670
Jerry Lewis like Jerry Lewis would become,

1556
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.120
he was like this nutty professor and they would become this really fucking cool

1557
00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:02.150
guy who had smoked cigarettes and the chicks all fawned over him.

1558
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.700
So he became like that guy.

1559
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.350
But now there's the blurred line between who he was.

1560
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.020
Like Andrew Silverstein and then the dice man.

1561
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:12.890
He's not gone.

1562
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.090
He is the dice man.

1563
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:16.070
Now you run into him at fucking Ralph's.

1564
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.900
He's got weightlifting gloves on.

1565
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.870
He's got he's,

1566
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.690
he taught me how to get this fanny pack.

1567
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.553
I did not know.

1568
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:22.611
This is the roots.

1569
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:23.450
Fanny pack is the one,

1570
00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:25.340
I sell them a higher primate.com.

1571
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:26.101
I fucked.

1572
00:42:26.101 --> 00:42:27.350
We found out about this from dice.

1573
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.870
Dice a recommendation.

1574
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.560
That's right.

1575
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.400
He came in with it.

1576
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.230
He came here that with sweat pants,

1577
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.520
with this fucking beautiful,

1578
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:35.600
glorious fanny pack.

1579
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:35.901
And I go,

1580
00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:37.010
where did you get that?

1581
00:42:37.011 --> 00:42:37.370
He goes,

1582
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.971
that's nice,

1583
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:38.540
right?

1584
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:38.841
I'm like,

1585
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:40.220
that's fucking gorgeous.

1586
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.200
I test the greatest fanny pack I've ever seen.

1587
00:42:42.201 --> 00:42:42.440
He goes,

1588
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:42.621
oh,

1589
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:43.710
it's the best stuff,

1590
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.570
best one.

1591
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:44.871
And he's like,

1592
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:45.890
show me all the features.

1593
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:46.041
Look,

1594
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:47.210
this one's got a little buckled,

1595
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:48.044
just got a zipper.

1596
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:48.770
I'm like,

1597
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.551
Whoa,

1598
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:50.480
it is the best.

1599
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:53.180
But he's that guy now that really is who he is.

1600
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.770
He's like all the time,

1601
00:42:54.771 --> 00:42:55.520
24 hours.

1602
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.630
You call them up in the middle of the night.

1603
00:42:56.631 --> 00:42:57.464
He's dice man.

1604
00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.120
He became that guy.

1605
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.041
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1606
00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:00.311
we,

1607
00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:00.880
uh,

1608
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.590
I opened up for him for like two,

1609
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.461
three years.

1610
00:43:03.461 --> 00:43:04.201
He really,

1611
00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:04.460
uh,

1612
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.640
he picked me out of the comedy story.

1613
00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:08.260
He came up to me and uh,

1614
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.490
at first he goes,

1615
00:43:09.491 --> 00:43:10.324
um,

1616
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:11.440
you know what you should do.

1617
00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:12.220
I said,

1618
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.053
what?

1619
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.100
When you go on stage,

1620
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:16.810
put a shock

1621
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:23.770
<v 1>pants and then you'll be like the comedian who's just got a big cock</v>

1622
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.470
and this is like,

1623
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.660
this is like my guy I looked up to

1624
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.180
and he's telling me.

1625
00:43:31.181 --> 00:43:32.140
And then I actually,

1626
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.250
I went home that night,

1627
00:43:33.251 --> 00:43:34.084
gone.

1628
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:35.043
Should I do,

1629
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.160
should I be CACTI?

1630
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:39.910
So,

1631
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.193
<v 0>uh,</v>

1632
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.090
anyway,

1633
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:43.630
we go.

1634
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.940
It was this kind of beard,

1635
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:45.880
little friendship.

1636
00:43:45.881 --> 00:43:50.260
And he asked me if I wanted to go to Las Vegas with him at the Stardust hotel.

1637
00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:51.094
And I'm like,

1638
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:51.490
yeah,

1639
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.420
call my parents.

1640
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:52.661
I go,

1641
00:43:52.661 --> 00:43:55.030
I'm opening up for dice clay at the stone us.

1642
00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:55.671
My mom was like,

1643
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:55.760
yeah,

1644
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.593
<v 1>you made it,</v>

1645
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.410
you made it.

1646
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.980
Wow.

1647
00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.150
So they all came out to see you

1648
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.690
<v 0>hung out with them on the road.</v>

1649
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:03.550
And uh,

1650
00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:04.780
the first time we played Vegas,

1651
00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:05.350
I'm like,

1652
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.080
I can't believe I'm here and Wayne Newton theater.

1653
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:09.340
I wonder what we're going to do,

1654
00:44:09.341 --> 00:44:09.601
you know,

1655
00:44:09.601 --> 00:44:11.050
excited and we'll go,

1656
00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:14.140
probably go out and dinner and we'll go out to a club,

1657
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.060
hang by the pool,

1658
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.190
probably got a Cabana,

1659
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.220
and he goes,

1660
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:19.960
we'll go and grow.

1661
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.350
Uh,

1662
00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:22.450
we'll go on the furniture shopping today.

1663
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:22.990
I go,

1664
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.823
Huh.

1665
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:25.120
And Los Vegas.

1666
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.530
So we went furniture shopping because he had a house out there and he was

1667
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:30.820
furnishing his house.

1668
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.870
So we would go to furniture stores and he would tell me,

1669
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.120
sit on the couch and sit.

1670
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.100
When he think I don't say grand guy,

1671
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:41.370
it's better than anything.

1672
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:42.630
I got it at my house,

1673
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:43.650
it's fantastic.

1674
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:45.240
And we would go to eat.

1675
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:45.691
I mean,

1676
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:46.980
this was a process.

1677
00:44:46.981 --> 00:44:51.540
We were laying on carpets to see if the carpet was comfortable.

1678
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.130
And uh,

1679
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:53.760
I'm like,

1680
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.480
uh,

1681
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.961
okay.

1682
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:55.930
I guess this is what you,

1683
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:56.700
you do.

1684
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.670
This is my first time on the road and were furniture shop out.

1685
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:01.681
Let's go out.

1686
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:03.000
And I made it a casino.

1687
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:03.791
Maybe we go for dinner.

1688
00:45:03.791 --> 00:45:04.081
And he's like,

1689
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:04.914
are you kidding me?

1690
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.390
It's like the Beatles.

1691
00:45:06.391 --> 00:45:06.931
If I go out,

1692
00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:07.840
that's like the Beethoven,

1693
00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.760
it's like mania.

1694
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.170
People gonna lose their mind.

1695
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.711
I can look,

1696
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:11.550
let's try it.

1697
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.391
And sure enough,

1698
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:15.120
we went through the casino yet is the glasses.

1699
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:20.121
He had like some big glitter ball on his back of his jacket that we went

1700
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:21.444
through.

1701
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:24.240
And it was like,

1702
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:25.590
it was fantastic.

1703
00:45:25.591 --> 00:45:25.981
It was like,

1704
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:26.520
Oh wow,

1705
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.690
this is what he's talking about.

1706
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:28.740
So to swarm him,

1707
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:29.000
right.

1708
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.833
Just warm them.

1709
00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.090
He's got like a,

1710
00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.820
like a loyal fan base.

1711
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.720
Oh yeah.

1712
00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:34.710
It's crazy.

1713
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.800
<v 1>I went to see him,</v>

1714
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.680
me and Jimmy Norton and Brian and uh,

1715
00:45:38.681 --> 00:45:38.981
who else?

1716
00:45:38.981 --> 00:45:42.660
Anthony [inaudible] from opening Anthony and Bobby Kelly and uh,

1717
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.550
we all went to a Anthony and um,

1718
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.440
and Jimmy Norton worn town for the fights.

1719
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.760
And I have the night off.

1720
00:45:48.761 --> 00:45:49.421
We had the nine off,

1721
00:45:49.421 --> 00:45:51.550
so we found out dice was in town.

1722
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.601
So a fuck,

1723
00:45:52.601 --> 00:45:53.381
let's go see dice.

1724
00:45:53.381 --> 00:45:55.090
Let's go see dice at the Riviera.

1725
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.841
So like,

1726
00:45:55.841 --> 00:45:57.790
which is classic Old Vegas,

1727
00:45:57.791 --> 00:45:57.941
you know,

1728
00:45:57.941 --> 00:45:59.800
that was the first place I ever worked in Vegas.

1729
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.030
So we went there,

1730
00:46:01.031 --> 00:46:01.601
we went to the,

1731
00:46:01.601 --> 00:46:01.751
uh,

1732
00:46:01.751 --> 00:46:01.961
you know,

1733
00:46:01.961 --> 00:46:05.880
they have the upper a showroom like the bigger show room where they have these,

1734
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:06.400
to have that,

1735
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.750
the drag queen show,

1736
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.201
you know,

1737
00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:11.170
the Frank Marino and you should do the drag queen show,

1738
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.490
this famous drag queen show.

1739
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:13.751
So we went up there,

1740
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:15.220
we had a fucking great time.

1741
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.061
We had a great time.

1742
00:46:16.061 --> 00:46:17.140
It was really fun.

1743
00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:18.131
It was really fun.

1744
00:46:18.131 --> 00:46:21.040
It was fun to sit there and the audience and just how,

1745
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.070
just how all laughing and his set was great.

1746
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.300
It was really funny.

1747
00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.270
We had a good time and then he was like all happy to see us.

1748
00:46:28.271 --> 00:46:29.010
We went backstage,

1749
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.820
we're hanging out with him and it was cool.

1750
00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:31.600
It was really cool.

1751
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.860
His son does drums,

1752
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.013
sunflowers,

1753
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.030
<v 0>man.</v>

1754
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:39.200
I want to go see their band about four months ago here in the valley and a great

1755
00:46:39.201 --> 00:46:39.681
band.

1756
00:46:39.681 --> 00:46:40.491
And he taught me a lot.

1757
00:46:40.491 --> 00:46:41.060
I mean he was,

1758
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.540
we'd have like long discussions at night cause he didn't really sleep and then

1759
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.383
we'd come,

1760
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:45.960
come by,

1761
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.870
let's talk and he doesn't sleep well.

1762
00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:49.040
You know what was up a lot,

1763
00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:49.321
you know,

1764
00:46:49.321 --> 00:46:50.310
I don't know for,

1765
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:50.961
for a comedian.

1766
00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:53.000
I go to bed early and he was up.

1767
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:53.870
What time you go to bed?

1768
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:54.420
Um,

1769
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:54.741
I don't know.

1770
00:46:54.741 --> 00:46:56.130
1130 kids,

1771
00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.420
right?

1772
00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:56.751
No,

1773
00:46:56.751 --> 00:46:57.300
not yet.

1774
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:57.591
Yeah.

1775
00:46:57.591 --> 00:46:58.450
Newly married.

1776
00:46:58.451 --> 00:46:59.600
37 30.

1777
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.493
I'm going to be weird.

1778
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.770
I don't come to anything.

1779
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.180
I don't think,

1780
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:06.420
I don't

1781
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.610
<v 1>get anything done until my kids are asleep.</v>

1782
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.521
Like I,

1783
00:47:09.521 --> 00:47:13.740
I try it like either I can only write when they're at school or when they're

1784
00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:14.130
asleep.

1785
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:16.710
That's the only time I can get things done because otherwise it's like,

1786
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:19.200
daddy come and do this dad and want to do that.

1787
00:47:19.201 --> 00:47:19.531
Daddy,

1788
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:20.130
come do this.

1789
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:20.963
What do you think of this?

1790
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.600
It's like,

1791
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.680
so I don't even try it.

1792
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:23.760
Like during the day when I'm with her,

1793
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:23.851
I'm,

1794
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:27.120
it's just play time with the kids or hanging out or do we do art together?

1795
00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:28.230
We do a lot of drawing together,

1796
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.280
but at nighttime that's when I get my shit done.

1797
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:32.410
So from 9:00 PM on,

1798
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:32.950
that's,

1799
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:33.401
if I'm not,

1800
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:35.110
if I don't have a set from 9:00 PM on,

1801
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:35.681
I'm writing,

1802
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:36.790
that's when I do my writing.

1803
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:37.624
That's what I do.

1804
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.250
I watch documentaries,

1805
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:39.520
you know,

1806
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.140
all that shit.

1807
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:40.480
Yeah.

1808
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.500
I get it all done at night.

1809
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.780
So oftentimes I don't go to bed until three,

1810
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:44.230
four o'clock.

1811
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.150
Oh yeah,

1812
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:45.340
no,

1813
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.060
you're late.

1814
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.080
It's pretty normal for me.

1815
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.330
Four or five or five.

1816
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.090
But he's,

1817
00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.560
he's like comedy story told to and then math and then,

1818
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.190
and then it hooks Tinder and Grindr.

1819
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.690
But take it as a workout.

1820
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.660
So you're all over the men.

1821
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:03.923
Yeah.

1822
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.780
So dice would be up like,

1823
00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:06.810
you know,

1824
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:07.600
he's,

1825
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.281
he's telling me,

1826
00:48:08.281 --> 00:48:08.410
no,

1827
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.130
you can't look at other people's career or you've got your own path.

1828
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.060
That's good advice.

1829
00:48:13.061 --> 00:48:13.391
You know,

1830
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:15.610
you can't be upset if somebody else gets something.

1831
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:15.821
You know.

1832
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:16.161
It just,

1833
00:48:16.161 --> 00:48:18.130
just really taught me Kinda how to,

1834
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:23.520
he's the only thing you have control of is how you perform and write anything

1835
00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:25.260
else is up in the,

1836
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.810
that's very good advice because Dan is a lot of wasted energy that a lot of

1837
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:32.080
comedians have worrying about other people's sets and worrying about other

1838
00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:32.770
people's careers.

1839
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.000
Like why is that guy getting this?

1840
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:34.931
Why is she,

1841
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:36.430
why is she on this fucking show?

1842
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:39.130
How come he got a thing or this and that and nothing to do with it.

1843
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:40.150
We've all seen that though.

1844
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:43.870
Those guys that get poisoned by other people's success and those guys,

1845
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:45.400
they always wind up failing to like,

1846
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:46.091
it falls apart.

1847
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:51.091
Like that's like jealousy is a poison that only it does the opposite of what you

1848
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:55.120
wanted to do instead of like when you,

1849
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.460
when you're jealous about somebody else's career,

1850
00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.080
it doesn't do anything bad to them,

1851
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.490
but it does something bad to you.

1852
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.051
Like it,

1853
00:49:01.051 --> 00:49:01.430
it's,

1854
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.590
it poisons you.

1855
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.160
Yeah.

1856
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.030
It's weird.

1857
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.100
Like people that say,

1858
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.010
fuck that guy,

1859
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:07.510
he's got this fucking TV show.

1860
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:08.830
He's the only even fucking phone.

1861
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.340
You know what I remember when he first started it,

1862
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.250
it was fucking middle and he was an open worker.

1863
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.353
Like it doesn't matter.

1864
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.081
It doesn't matter.

1865
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:15.660
He's on TV now and you're here,

1866
00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:16.250
here.

1867
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.083
Here's you,

1868
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.040
you when that,

1869
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:18.791
when the guy says,

1870
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:19.481
ladies and gentlemen,

1871
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:20.850
please welcome Mike Cost.

1872
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:21.370
Fuck.

1873
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:22.240
And you go on stage,

1874
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:22.961
that's your time,

1875
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:23.290
dude.

1876
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:23.920
That's it.

1877
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.180
All that shit in between.

1878
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.770
Like you don't,

1879
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.633
don't do that.

1880
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:28.743
It's a waste.

1881
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.613
It's not good.

1882
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.800
So dice gave me some good advice to [inaudible] the reason why I started going

1883
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:33.580
on the road.

1884
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:33.970
Oh yeah,

1885
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:34.750
yeah,

1886
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.090
yeah.

1887
00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:35.380
I was,

1888
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.700
I was doing just a store.

1889
00:49:36.701 --> 00:49:37.900
I would just do the store.

1890
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.450
And then somewhere in the 90s when I was on news radio,

1891
00:49:40.451 --> 00:49:40.901
dice goes,

1892
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:41.734
you're a funny guy.

1893
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.573
You should do it all wrong.

1894
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:43.931
And I go,

1895
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:44.380
yeah.

1896
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:44.711
He goes,

1897
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:45.240
yeah,

1898
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:45.970
she's doing the road.

1899
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.870
Why don't you do the road?

1900
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.591
And I go,

1901
00:49:47.591 --> 00:49:47.891
I don't know.

1902
00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:48.161
I mean,

1903
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:48.851
I'm always working here.

1904
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:49.091
He goes,

1905
00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:49.271
yeah,

1906
00:49:49.271 --> 00:49:50.104
but you know what?

1907
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:50.531
He goes,

1908
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:51.730
you've got TV shows.

1909
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:52.091
He goes,

1910
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:52.840
you're on TV.

1911
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.260
He board.

1912
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.093
If that goes away,

1913
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:54.731
it goes,

1914
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:56.350
you don't want to fucking need those guys.

1915
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.041
He goes,

1916
00:49:57.041 --> 00:49:57.261
you know,

1917
00:49:57.261 --> 00:49:57.941
you could do great.

1918
00:49:57.941 --> 00:49:59.410
You could have a great career on the road.

1919
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.080
And I remember thinking like,

1920
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.260
he's fucking right.

1921
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:03.700
Like what if TV shows go away?

1922
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.180
Yeah.

1923
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.080
Like what if you know,

1924
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:08.410
news radio gets canceled and then I can't get another show and then I'm fucked.

1925
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.760
I should go through the road.

1926
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:11.260
And I started doing the road because the dice,

1927
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.370
Tonya percent,

1928
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.450
100% his advice now this,

1929
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.330
did you fall into news radio and like,

1930
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:16.660
Hey,

1931
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.190
did you get a lot of addition for that part and get it for it?

1932
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:20.710
Yeah,

1933
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.090
that was totally a,

1934
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:23.970
you were just doing the audition game.

1935
00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:25.300
You booked a show and then,

1936
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.320
well,

1937
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.920
I had a show that it was a show that got canceled.

1938
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.050
It was called hardball.

1939
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:34.130
That was on in 94 93 or 94 and it didn't last.

1940
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.420
It only went like six episodes.

1941
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.350
I came out for that,

1942
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.220
but when it,

1943
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.330
when I was an idiot,

1944
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:38.780
you know,

1945
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.220
25 or something,

1946
00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:42.740
whatever the fuck I was 26 and I thought,

1947
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.041
oh,

1948
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:44.300
this is definitely going to go,

1949
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.470
I'm going to get an apartment.

1950
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.230
So I leased an apartment and then I'm stuck here.

1951
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:50.120
Once the show got canceled after six episodes,

1952
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:50.450
I was like,

1953
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:51.060
oh great.

1954
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.380
And I'm stuck here and I didn't know what to do and I was trying to figure it

1955
00:50:54.381 --> 00:50:54.681
out.

1956
00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:55.220
And uh,

1957
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:55.581
I said,

1958
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:55.881
well,

1959
00:50:55.881 --> 00:50:57.230
I guess I'll just stay for awhile.

1960
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:57.610
I hate,

1961
00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:58.790
I was ready to go back to New York.

1962
00:50:58.791 --> 00:50:59.990
I hated it out here.

1963
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.180
I hated working with actors,

1964
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:07.070
like I couldn't believe how pretentious they were and ridiculous and pampered.

1965
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.720
Like working with actors was fucking mind boggling to me because I was used to

1966
00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:13.050
comics who,

1967
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:13.521
you know,

1968
00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:17.330
especially like east coast comics constantly busting each other's balls,

1969
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:20.990
always joking around and there was like a comradery with comics.

1970
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.520
Like we would go on the road together,

1971
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:24.680
like comics would give each other the taglines.

1972
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:25.401
We'd always say,

1973
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:25.551
hey,

1974
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:26.001
it was great.

1975
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:27.680
Said you know this and that and blah blah blah.

1976
00:51:27.681 --> 00:51:28.280
And you know,

1977
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:28.610
he would,

1978
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.940
there was like a feeling of like belonging and then all of a sudden I was out

1979
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:33.140
here with these actresses like,

1980
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.951
Oh God,

1981
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:34.460
I can't even,

1982
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.410
I can't even talk to these fucking people.

1983
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:39.310
They were all back stabby and they were like,

1984
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:39.630
they were,

1985
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.490
they would fuck with you before you're seen and say creepy shit to you.

1986
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:44.180
And there was like,

1987
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.550
there was so much weirdness.

1988
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.310
It was just so much weirdness had fakeness.

1989
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.450
They would say things that,

1990
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:50.721
you know,

1991
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:51.830
they didn't really mean.

1992
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.180
They would love to say like,

1993
00:51:53.181 --> 00:51:53.871
they meet people,

1994
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:55.340
they had this fake way of talking like,

1995
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:55.671
Oh,

1996
00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:56.600
nice to see you.

1997
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:57.321
Like it was like,

1998
00:51:57.321 --> 00:51:58.670
there's like this fucking,

1999
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:02.990
they would pretend to be this person who's like super professional so that they

2000
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:04.400
could get hired and do something else.

2001
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:04.731
Meanwhile,

2002
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:08.750
they were a boiling cauldron of crazy under the surface,

2003
00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.010
just trying to keep it together until they fucking gotten to their car and just

2004
00:52:13.011 --> 00:52:16.940
scream all the way home and then pop pills or do whatever the fuck they did.

2005
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.960
So I,

2006
00:52:17.961 --> 00:52:18.740
um,

2007
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.950
I got another development deal I did from the hardball show.

2008
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.730
I got a development deal with NBC and I was supposed to do my own show and then

2009
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:26.471
they,

2010
00:52:26.471 --> 00:52:26.750
uh,

2011
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.770
brought me in and they said,

2012
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:29.060
we would like to talk to you about something.

2013
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:30.400
We've got this other show that a,

2014
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.640
we're going to cast.

2015
00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:32.120
We're,

2016
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.870
we're um,

2017
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.130
replacing one of the characters.

2018
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.930
The original character was Ray Romano,

2019
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:36.973
is that right?

2020
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.640
Yeah,

2021
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.473
yeah,

2022
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:38.691
yeah.

2023
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:43.640
Ray Romano was originally in the pilot and then he got fired from the pilot and

2024
00:52:43.641 --> 00:52:48.140
they brought in a new guy to play the Ray Romano character in the pilot.

2025
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.790
And then they got rid of that guy.

2026
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.640
And so I felt better cause I didn't replace ray or a place,

2027
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:55.130
the Guy who replaced ray and then um,

2028
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.290
they had auditions and I came in and auditioned for it.

2029
00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:57.950
Wow.

2030
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:58.191
Yeah,

2031
00:52:58.191 --> 00:52:59.930
it's amazing how stuff that's stupid.

2032
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:00.764
Dumb luck.

2033
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.180
Just dumb luck.

2034
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.860
I remember being at the audition,

2035
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.080
the first one was a cattle call.

2036
00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.350
I was like fucking a hundred dudes.

2037
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:07.071
And I was like,

2038
00:53:07.071 --> 00:53:08.750
what are the odds of getting that Jesus Christ?

2039
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:09.710
What are these fucking people?

2040
00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.250
I did the audition and it was not funny at all,

2041
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.570
but they did it on purpose.

2042
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.920
They literally wrote a script that wasn't funny cause they wanted to make sure

2043
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:20.810
people weren't like fucking hamming it up.

2044
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.850
You want to make sure that people didn't try super hard and make something

2045
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:27.450
funny.

2046
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:27.901
So,

2047
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:28.500
uh,

2048
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.990
then I got a call back and I was like,

2049
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:31.770
really?

2050
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.410
It was like,

2051
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.243
okay.

2052
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:37.440
So I went in for the call back and this time the script was hilarious and I was

2053
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:37.650
like,

2054
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:38.251
oh,

2055
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:39.660
I see what they did.

2056
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:41.340
They weeded out all the Hams,

2057
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.750
they weeded out all the,

2058
00:53:42.751 --> 00:53:45.900
the Huc and I went to the script and it was mean,

2059
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.950
and two or three other guys that looked like they were about to go to nom,

2060
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:53.760
they were pale and sweaty and nervous and going over their lines.

2061
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.230
And I remember looking at these guys,

2062
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:55.620
I'm like,

2063
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:55.950
oh,

2064
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.180
I got this.

2065
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.290
So I plopped down on the couch where these guys were going over the lines.

2066
00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:02.670
I put my fucking feet up,

2067
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:05.340
I put my hands behind my head and I was like,

2068
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:05.581
look,

2069
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:05.731
hey,

2070
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:06.900
you fucking pussies.

2071
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.370
You guys are scared.

2072
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.410
And because he's very scared.

2073
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:12.630
I knew these are the only guys that were auditioning.

2074
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.400
I was super confident.

2075
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.730
So I went in there like super relaxed and I nailed it and then I got it.

2076
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.440
But there was just looking at those guys,

2077
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.870
looking at people that are scared can give you a lot of,

2078
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:22.590
yeah,

2079
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:23.423
yeah.

2080
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.690
Especially if you hear it from the waiting room or somebody else's audition,

2081
00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.533
you're like,

2082
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.970
I ain't even funny guys.

2083
00:54:29.971 --> 00:54:30.870
I got a funny in there.

2084
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.411
Yeah,

2085
00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:31.591
it was.

2086
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:31.890
They were,

2087
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:32.723
they were like,

2088
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:33.720
they were just calm.

2089
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:33.961
They were,

2090
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:34.860
they were actors rather.

2091
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:35.730
They weren't comics.

2092
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:36.803
They didn't know how to end.

2093
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.490
The writing was really good,

2094
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.150
so I went from the show that was like the worst case show.

2095
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:44.190
It was terrible show that horrible show.

2096
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:45.060
It just wasn't good.

2097
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:49.020
They brought in this really bad guy who was like an executive producer of coach.

2098
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.740
Remember that show coach and he was like hammered it out.

2099
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.100
Everything was just gross,

2100
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:54.270
shitty writing,

2101
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.510
real hacky premises are just garbage show.

2102
00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:02.760
And then from that to working with Phil Hartman and Dave Foley and Steven Rude,

2103
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:03.031
I was like,

2104
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:04.170
Jesus Christ,

2105
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.790
Maura Tierney,

2106
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:07.710
candy Alexander and Vicky Lewis.

2107
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:08.041
I was like,

2108
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:09.120
this is nuts.

2109
00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:11.910
Just sitting at the fucking table with Phil Hartman,

2110
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.590
like reading with Phil Hartman.

2111
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:18.030
Like I'd only been doing standup for five years and all of a sudden I'm sitting

2112
00:55:18.031 --> 00:55:19.380
next to Phil Hartman at this,

2113
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.690
this table.

2114
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.350
Crazy reading for a sitcom.

2115
00:55:22.351 --> 00:55:23.850
Like this is madness.

2116
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:25.200
This doesn't even make sense.

2117
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:26.220
Yeah.

2118
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.053
Just dumb luck.

2119
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:28.800
But you know what?

2120
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.370
All that stuff was cool but it was bigger to me was becoming a paid regular at

2121
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:33.080
the comedy store.

2122
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:33.720
Yeah.

2123
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.950
That was the biggest thing to me.

2124
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:37.860
It was like having a sitcom that's all well and good.

2125
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:40.440
But when I became a paid regular at the store,

2126
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:41.274
I was like,

2127
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:42.930
Holy Shit.

2128
00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:44.310
I remember going back to my apartment.

2129
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:45.001
I had an apartment,

2130
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:46.860
the oakwoods and all those uh,

2131
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:48.930
those little shitty pre uh,

2132
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.020
pre fucking furnished apartments.

2133
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.590
I used to go back to that shit hole every night after I was a non paid regular,

2134
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:59.430
these depressing farted in couches and Burbank.

2135
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:00.450
Yeah.

2136
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.800
You know that off of olive oil,

2137
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:03.330
I used to live.

2138
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:04.440
Corey Haim died there

2139
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:07.410
at the Auto Co.

2140
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:07.890
Quick ones.

2141
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.290
Really make sense doing drugs.

2142
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.303
Yeah.

2143
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.570
Wow.

2144
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:12.960
All right,

2145
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.890
well I got there first,

2146
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.610
got there before he died,

2147
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:21.480
but once I became a paid regular the store,

2148
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:23.550
that was everything to me that uh,

2149
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.010
you know,

2150
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.640
I was in,

2151
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.060
I was like,

2152
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:25.630
you know,

2153
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:27.070
you have like these little milestones.

2154
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:27.381
I be like,

2155
00:56:27.381 --> 00:56:27.850
yeah,

2156
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:28.190
you know,

2157
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:30.490
like getting a record with Warner brothers.

2158
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:31.330
That was a milestone.

2159
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:31.921
You know,

2160
00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:32.510
you're like,

2161
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:33.760
if there's little things where you're like,

2162
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:34.241
okay,

2163
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:34.850
I can't get care,

2164
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:35.770
I guess I'm doing this.

2165
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:40.240
I am actually doing this because for a while you feel like a fraud and now for

2166
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:43.180
the first few years of your career you're out there doing your,

2167
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:43.541
you know,

2168
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:47.470
you just feel like a fraud and people want you to feel like a fraud to other

2169
00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:48.970
comics want you to feel like a fraud.

2170
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:49.870
Like there's a lot of,

2171
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.380
a lot of fucking crabs in a bucket going on in that business.

2172
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:54.580
Especially in early,

2173
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:56.320
a lot of crabs in a bucket.

2174
00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:58.660
They just try to pull the other crabs down as they tried to get out.

2175
00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:00.071
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2176
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:00.990
That's why I kinda,

2177
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.833
I just stayed,

2178
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:03.950
I had a job working at the four season,

2179
00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:05.710
so towel while I was doing the standup.

2180
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.130
So I had kind of like a separate group of friends at my job.

2181
00:57:09.131 --> 00:57:13.000
I didn't really hang out with a lot of comedians at night just because I was so

2182
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:15.970
involved at this four seasons during the day and I was,

2183
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:19.450
I was hanging out with them after work and I one season down here?

2184
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.960
Yeah.

2185
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.420
Which where's that though?

2186
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.340
Heaney and Burton way.

2187
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.473
What'd you do over there?

2188
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.650
I was in the windows loan.

2189
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.500
I was a cocktail waitress,

2190
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.670
basically put about 10 girls and me and another guy.

2191
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:37.690
Did you put the sock in?

2192
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.213
Of course.

2193
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:42.970
This fucking guy.

2194
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.120
Oh yeah.

2195
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:47.200
So how long did you do that for?

2196
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:48.640
Seven and a half years.

2197
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:53.080
Started in 98 and then I left in 2005 wow.

2198
00:57:53.081 --> 00:57:54.550
I mean that's supplemented my income.

2199
00:57:54.551 --> 00:57:55.510
That's was,

2200
00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.200
I wasn't in the road guy,

2201
00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:58.810
didn't really do a lot of feature work.

2202
00:57:58.811 --> 00:58:01.460
I just kind of honed it in here in Los Angeles and,

2203
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.520
and worked at the four seasons.

2204
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:04.271
In the meantime,

2205
00:58:04.271 --> 00:58:06.190
just kind of hoping something would break.

2206
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:09.610
Just doing the comedy store and just local local sets.

2207
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:10.601
That's awesome.

2208
00:58:10.601 --> 00:58:12.160
So where else did you besides the store?

2209
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:13.301
Uh,

2210
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:13.931
well I went to,

2211
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:18.760
I went to the laugh factory and Massada asked me what lay lay you angry?

2212
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:19.803
Well he's like,

2213
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.793
Hey,

2214
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.130
hey Sam.

2215
00:58:24.131 --> 00:58:25.330
Kennison angry for a reason.

2216
00:58:25.331 --> 00:58:26.164
But yeah.

2217
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:29.800
So why was Sam Kinison angry for a reason?

2218
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:30.161
I don't know.

2219
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:31.900
He said he had a reason to.

2220
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:34.900
His anger and my anger was displaced.

2221
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:39.930
So mad at Ross dress for less because I remember that bed keep fucking so angry.

2222
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.310
That was my first introduction of the La.

2223
00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.850
I went to Ross dress for less with my father to buy like bedding.

2224
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.850
He came out here to visit and he goes,

2225
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:51.940
let's go to Ross.

2226
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:52.780
Thank you.

2227
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.710
Get some pillows.

2228
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:54.731
And we walked in.

2229
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.001
We're like,

2230
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:57.310
what the F is going on here?

2231
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:02.290
So a bit,

2232
00:59:02.291 --> 00:59:03.071
cause it is true,

2233
00:59:03.071 --> 00:59:04.330
anybody who's ever been there,

2234
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.820
but if the bit they used to do the way he would do it,

2235
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:10.540
like do people just take this and just get across the room?

2236
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.560
So we're coming from the northwest suburbs of Chicago,

2237
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:15.280
you know,

2238
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.680
very neatly put together stores.

2239
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:20.980
And now I went to the Ross on third and uh,

2240
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:21.890
forget it.

2241
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.980
I

2242
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.161
<v 1>mean,</v>

2243
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:22.761
there was just,

2244
00:59:22.761 --> 00:59:24.950
it's like a hodge podge of stuff over there.

2245
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:28.970
There's like a bra mixed in with like a games.

2246
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.530
So it was like,

2247
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.270
that's where that anger came from,

2248
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:32.810
of like,

2249
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:33.171
God,

2250
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:34.880
I feel like a fish out of water.

2251
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:35.870
That's the whole thing.

2252
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:36.800
When I first came to La,

2253
00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:38.030
I didn't feel like I fit in.

2254
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:39.050
I feel like I was,

2255
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:39.801
you know,

2256
00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:41.330
I was the guy wearing the caviar reach,

2257
00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:42.590
he's going to a nightclub.

2258
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.000
It's 17 years old.

2259
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:47.450
So we'll take the cues that everybody feels like they don't fit in.

2260
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.250
You know,

2261
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.650
everybody does in the beginning you can pretend,

2262
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.400
but you never,

2263
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.000
I mean,

2264
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.230
I feel like I fit in now.

2265
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.111
Oh yeah.

2266
00:59:55.111 --> 00:59:55.290
You know,

2267
00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:56.180
it's a long time.

2268
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.481
Yeah,

2269
00:59:56.481 --> 00:59:57.260
it takes awhile.

2270
00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.420
But in the beginning I think everybody feels like they don't fit in.

2271
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.160
I think one of the great things is what you're doing.

2272
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:01.761
The,

2273
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:02.240
uh,

2274
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.073
um,

2275
01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:08.110
killed Tony that gives people an introduction to stand up and an introduction to

2276
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:09.111
like,

2277
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:09.411
you know,

2278
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:10.670
like you're in the big leagues.

2279
01:00:10.671 --> 01:00:11.240
Like real,

2280
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:11.930
real quick.

2281
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:16.280
Like you're on a podcast that gets seen by or listened to by hundreds of

2282
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.980
thousands of people and you're there with dom.

2283
01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:21.380
I rare a judging you and Tony Hinchcliffe and Sarah Silverman and all these

2284
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:25.190
different people that are really funny comedians or up like watching you do

2285
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:28.460
stand up putting you in these very super high pressure situations.

2286
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:31.580
You're doing one minute in front of a microphone and then you kind of get to say

2287
01:00:31.581 --> 01:00:32.680
hi to those people.

2288
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.350
They become,

2289
01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:34.590
they've seem like normal.

2290
01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:34.900
I wish

2291
01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.830
<v 2>I had it when I was a kid or when I started off because all right,</v>

2292
01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.530
you,

2293
01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:42.070
that's so good for them because they can have it on tape.

2294
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.210
They can go over it.

2295
01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:46.600
They can have like professional comedians like dissect what they're doing wrong

2296
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:50.320
instead of just like doing it in front of two other comics that even pay

2297
01:00:50.321 --> 01:00:51.490
attention and you just go home,

2298
01:00:51.491 --> 01:00:51.720
go,

2299
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:51.941
oh,

2300
01:00:51.941 --> 01:00:52.511
I think I did it.

2301
01:00:52.511 --> 01:00:53.270
Okay.

2302
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:55.480
Those are the open Mike Nights where you're doing it.

2303
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.690
You're doing your act to a bunch of people of senior act and their comics.

2304
01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.050
Yeah.

2305
01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.000
You'll like 10 people in the audience are all comics.

2306
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:01.841
Those are brutal.

2307
01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:03.610
It's almost like half the shows are that,

2308
01:01:03.611 --> 01:01:03.930
you know,

2309
01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:04.770
you're an open mic or I,

2310
01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.750
I mean when I started it was Chris Delea,

2311
01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.780
Dean Delray me and we'd go to the same four different open mics every day and it

2312
01:01:12.941 --> 01:01:13.600
was just like,

2313
01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.350
oh,

2314
01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:15.820
you're my audience last,

2315
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.170
you know,

2316
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:16.640
our,

2317
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:16.980
you know,

2318
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.110
it's the same audience over and over because it's just an audience of five other

2319
01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:23.020
comics that you went from one to open my to another.

2320
01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:23.381
Yeah.

2321
01:01:23.381 --> 01:01:24.370
That's where some comics,

2322
01:01:24.371 --> 01:01:27.700
they fall into that trap of doing stand up for the back of the room.

2323
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.820
They'd be like really obscure shit that only the comics think is funny.

2324
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:31.640
Yeah.

2325
01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.473
I mean it Kinda,

2326
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.210
it's Kinda practice in a way,

2327
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:34.810
you know,

2328
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.960
it gives you a way to figure out a way to make something funny out of this

2329
01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:38.530
moment,

2330
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.700
but it's not a real crowd,

2331
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.101
you know?

2332
01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:42.370
It's just you kind of like fucking around.

2333
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:44.830
It's easy to fall into that and never get out of that too.

2334
01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:47.290
For a while I just had to make myself stop.

2335
01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:48.101
Like I'm done with this.

2336
01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:52.090
I'm not going to hog cafe anymore and spending $5 to go home to five minutes and

2337
01:01:52.091 --> 01:01:52.470
I'm like,

2338
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.500
they can take charge you.

2339
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.051
Yeah.

2340
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:59.051
A lot of places charge you a ha ha used to be $5 but you got a beer and you got

2341
01:01:59.411 --> 01:02:01.600
to do five minutes and now it's,

2342
01:02:01.601 --> 01:02:02.470
you don't get a beer

2343
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.980
for $5 I guess.

2344
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.990
Well those clubs are barely hanging on,

2345
01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:08.830
you know?

2346
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:10.090
You mean even the ice house,

2347
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:11.710
which is like one of the best clubs in the world.

2348
01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:13.000
It kind of barely hanging on,

2349
01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:13.680
you know?

2350
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.160
Yeah.

2351
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.850
Well you got two phones over there for you.

2352
01:02:15.851 --> 01:02:16.180
Fuck,

2353
01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.830
I got the new Samsung note five.

2354
01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.160
Oh is it by the way,

2355
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.130
one of the first phones that I've ever had that almost,

2356
01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:25.400
I'm almost done with the iPhone after this phone real.

2357
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:28.080
It's got one of the most amazing cameras.

2358
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.460
It's got all these really cool things.

2359
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.660
Look at this like if you're,

2360
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.100
if you're out and you're just like,

2361
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:32.281
oh,

2362
01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.120
I need to write a note,

2363
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:34.110
you just take the pin out.

2364
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.070
It can be like,

2365
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:35.690
oh,

2366
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:38.610
you could just write it right here on the screen on the screen,

2367
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:40.620
and then you can just be like,

2368
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:41.040
hey,

2369
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:41.371
you know,

2370
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:42.280
I got to remember to eat this.

2371
01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.753
That,

2372
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:47.910
that's always a problem.

2373
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.793
Yeah,

2374
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.180
it's crazy good.

2375
01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:56.181
I highly recommend this and it's got a feature in the camera where you can just

2376
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:58.140
broadcast right to youtube.

2377
01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.430
So kind of like periscope.

2378
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.951
Uh,

2379
01:02:59.951 --> 01:03:00.601
you could just be like,

2380
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:01.110
boom,

2381
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.430
I'm broadcasting now on youtube.

2382
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.570
Yeah,

2383
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:04.800
it's built into the camera.

2384
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:05.161
Yeah,

2385
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:05.941
they've taken,

2386
01:03:05.941 --> 01:03:10.260
they've noticed how a popular periscopes been in live apps like that.

2387
01:03:10.261 --> 01:03:13.200
So they've decided just to build it right into the operating system.

2388
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:15.360
So now you can just broadcast live from it.

2389
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.190
Why is it better than the edge?

2390
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:18.840
A way better than than the edge.

2391
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:19.201
This,

2392
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:20.034
this is,

2393
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:20.680
I love this.

2394
01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.420
What's better?

2395
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.260
What's better about it?

2396
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.120
The problem I had with the edges that the,

2397
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:26.220
that while the edge was neat to look at the,

2398
01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:28.410
the corners where it's wrapped around the side,

2399
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:32.640
I was constantly hitting buttons and also had a really sharp edge to it.

2400
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:32.910
You know,

2401
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:33.870
the feel of it,

2402
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.100
which just doesn't,

2403
01:03:35.101 --> 01:03:36.810
this is more like an iPhone,

2404
01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:37.270
so it's,

2405
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.350
it's nice and soft.

2406
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.263
Sorry.

2407
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:40.163
Yeah.

2408
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:40.320
Yeah.

2409
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.760
You can't beat the camera in the Samsungs smaller than an iPhone.

2410
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.020
It is smaller than an iPhone.

2411
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:47.430
It's thinner than an iPhone.

2412
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.670
Ooh.

2413
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:48.810
It's a good size for you,

2414
01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.470
man.

2415
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:50.580
My hands are pretty big,

2416
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.773
but I could get,

2417
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.040
I can get this,

2418
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.410
I could do like a one hand to text with those easy.

2419
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.950
Yeah,

2420
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:56.783
it's great.

2421
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.150
This is awesome.

2422
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.050
It also has the ability to edit PDFs.

2423
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:02.640
So if somebody sends you a pdf and was like,

2424
01:04:02.641 --> 01:04:02.761
hey,

2425
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:05.910
I need you to print this out and sign it now you can just edit it right on the

2426
01:04:05.911 --> 01:04:06.241
fly,

2427
01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:07.074
send it back.

2428
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.040
Which is cool.

2429
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.360
Uh,

2430
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:09.680
the,

2431
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:09.871
the,

2432
01:04:09.871 --> 01:04:12.510
I'm just amazed by the camera the most though.

2433
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.600
It was the first time that Samsung or any galaxy phone,

2434
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.440
it actually had a camera that's I think better than the iPhone camera.

2435
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:19.831
Y'All.

2436
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:20.100
Yeah.

2437
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.870
What are you using for your,

2438
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:22.704
um,

2439
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:24.301
for your,

2440
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.200
uh,

2441
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:26.670
for your provider,

2442
01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:27.990
a t mobile,

2443
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:28.943
and you liked that?

2444
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:29.481
I left him.

2445
01:04:29.481 --> 01:04:29.551
Oh,

2446
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:29.731
well,

2447
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:30.720
I'm on a family plan.

2448
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:31.650
Both of these phones.

2449
01:04:31.651 --> 01:04:32.221
Uh,

2450
01:04:32.221 --> 01:04:33.600
I have unlimited data.

2451
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:36.810
I think it's like $99 a month for both phones.

2452
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:37.703
Unlimited data.

2453
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.790
I'm looking through your Instagram.

2454
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:39.301
It's hilarious.

2455
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:40.134
Where you fall.

2456
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:40.973
Brian follows.

2457
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.290
All girls are sticking their asses out.

2458
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.760
It's just a slew of girls sticking their asses out.

2459
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.770
It's one after the other.

2460
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.420
All these different scans.

2461
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.860
I say stacks.

2462
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.090
Skanks with all due respect,

2463
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.910
we're all due respect.

2464
01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:56.850
A bunch of holes,

2465
01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:59.770
a bunch of uz.

2466
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.181
Wow.

2467
01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:01.140
You've got a lot of hot girls.

2468
01:05:01.141 --> 01:05:02.070
You're following my friend.

2469
01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:02.963
Oh yeah.

2470
01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:04.323
He was single.

2471
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:05.130
I didn't know.

2472
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:05.963
Not Anymore.

2473
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:06.490
Okay.

2474
01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:07.620
Got Himself a girl.

2475
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:07.921
Well,

2476
01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:08.754
he's not married.

2477
01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.813
Not married though.

2478
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.733
That's the way to go.

2479
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:12.420
Even if you're not single,

2480
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:13.343
you're not married.

2481
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.360
And that's the thing about this fucking,

2482
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.610
this lady that's not marrying these gay people.

2483
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.010
[inaudible] she's doing them a favor,

2484
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.971
like,

2485
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:22.804
don't do it.

2486
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.620
What are you doing?

2487
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.540
You got to got it made you fucks.

2488
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:26.703
You got it made.

2489
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.170
It's,

2490
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.630
it's right now it's illegal.

2491
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.050
Well now,

2492
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:29.883
now it is illegal.

2493
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.670
But for the longest time it was illegal and these guys had to go in there and

2494
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:34.450
fuck it up.

2495
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.400
I can understand lesbians wanting to get married.

2496
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:37.690
It's every girl's dream.

2497
01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:38.973
But come on.

2498
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.750
These guys that are fighting for it,

2499
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.910
like it's too hard.

2500
01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:43.150
Just say you can't do it.

2501
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.021
I go out,

2502
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:44.801
it's like a marathon.

2503
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:45.280
I can't do,

2504
01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.113
I can't run it.

2505
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.840
Just say it.

2506
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.940
Say you don't have to do it.

2507
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:49.691
Just do it.

2508
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:50.381
Root style,

2509
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:52.180
lay of broom and the ground jump over it like,

2510
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.990
like Kizzy and uh,

2511
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.160
couldn't to Kente did Joe,

2512
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.310
another cool thing about it,

2513
01:05:57.311 --> 01:06:01.450
say like if there's an interview of you and you're like,

2514
01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:01.810
you know what?

2515
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.130
I want to save this interview.

2516
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.290
It's on a website right now or something like that.

2517
01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:05.490
Oh yeah.

2518
01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:06.940
You circle it used to be,

2519
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:10.120
it could take a screenshot or something that this new thing called screen

2520
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:10.900
capture.

2521
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.570
Where what,

2522
01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:12.020
what,

2523
01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:12.920
what you do is screen.

2524
01:06:12.921 --> 01:06:13.180
Right.

2525
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.160
And so what it does is it takes a picture of it,

2526
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.940
then you can go advanced it so it will scroll down automatically,

2527
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.073
take a picture,

2528
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:20.973
take a picture,

2529
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:21.881
take a picture.

2530
01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:25.330
So go through the whole entire website and now it just made it a huge jpeg.

2531
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.530
So you could have like a whole jpeg saved your gallery so it saves a websites

2532
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.920
and then you could like ride on it and send it to people if you wanted it to.

2533
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:34.960
Is that how the fat Jewish steals all of us stuff?

2534
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.823
Yeah,

2535
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.993
that's right.

2536
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.350
As soon as you took the pen out,

2537
01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.210
it kind of lost me because,

2538
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.880
uh,

2539
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.100
it,

2540
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.130
it just seems like a annoying,

2541
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:44.860
well that's a lot going on man.

2542
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:45.851
There's a lot going on.

2543
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:48.940
I mean that you're doing pens.

2544
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.421
Honestly,

2545
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:50.254
I never even,

2546
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.081
I always forget that,

2547
01:06:51.081 --> 01:06:51.914
that there is a pin.

2548
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.773
I owe it.

2549
01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:53.723
I never take it out.

2550
01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.500
No,

2551
01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.860
the new one just clicks in there so you don't,

2552
01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:57.130
you don't,

2553
01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:58.510
it just snaps in.

2554
01:06:58.511 --> 01:06:58.921
So it's like,

2555
01:06:58.921 --> 01:07:00.580
isn't there one that's waterproof?

2556
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:01.120
Don't know.

2557
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:01.871
They have a sport.

2558
01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:05.620
They have the Samsung s six edge sport or something like that,

2559
01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:09.910
which is just a built a little bit more tough and it's waterproof again.

2560
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.750
Uh,

2561
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.980
I asked about that and he says,

2562
01:07:11.981 --> 01:07:12.131
yeah,

2563
01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:13.960
it's just a more rugged phone,

2564
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:14.500
but uh,

2565
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.333
this is a little bit,

2566
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.780
how's the battery life on that thing?

2567
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:17.230
Great.

2568
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:18.850
And it's got the new fast charger.

2569
01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:23.140
I have a a charging pad now where I just go home and just set it on this table

2570
01:07:23.141 --> 01:07:23.800
and then pick it up.

2571
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.011
I said,

2572
01:07:24.011 --> 01:07:25.350
I don't have to plug it in anymore.

2573
01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:29.020
Do you have to put a special case on it to use that fast charge thing?

2574
01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:29.830
Are these,

2575
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:33.040
the new Samsungs are built into the phone and you don't have to take off the

2576
01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:33.951
normal case.

2577
01:07:33.951 --> 01:07:34.870
So if you have a case on it,

2578
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:35.651
you don't have to take it off.

2579
01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.730
It just goes through it.

2580
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:38.860
So you just sit down on to conference.

2581
01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:43.970
I'm just amazed at the knowledge of like when I listened to the sales guy

2582
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.310
telling me the options,

2583
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.210
I'm not even there.

2584
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:46.661
I'm just like,

2585
01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:47.171
give me the phone,

2586
01:07:47.171 --> 01:07:48.004
let me get out of here.

2587
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.050
You actually retain the information.

2588
01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:50.350
Yeah.

2589
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:54.610
So I love this shit goes on mine and he actually makes videos with these for the

2590
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:56.610
longest time before Amazon fucked him.

2591
01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.280
And he used to have this great thing he was doing where he would buy something

2592
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:04.120
like buy a camera and then he would review it and then put up a link,

2593
01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:04.571
uh,

2594
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:05.530
from his Amazon.

2595
01:08:05.531 --> 01:08:06.520
So like if somebody bought it,

2596
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:07.900
he would get like a cut or a kickback.

2597
01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:09.880
So I'd get free stuff pretty much.

2598
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:12.910
Cause I would just do such good reviews on these cameras that so many people

2599
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:13.631
would click on it.

2600
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.610
It would pay for the camera.

2601
01:08:14.611 --> 01:08:17.900
And so it was a way for me to get stuff that like cameras and stuff I couldn't

2602
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:18.450
afford.

2603
01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:18.751
<v 1>Oh,</v>

2604
01:08:18.751 --> 01:08:19.830
how come they don't,

2605
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:20.200
why don't,

2606
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.210
why isn't that happening anymore?

2607
01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:21.990
What happened there?

2608
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.560
<v 2>I Dunno,</v>

2609
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.131
they uh,

2610
01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:27.960
they said that somebody reported me as saying I had porn on my website and so

2611
01:08:27.961 --> 01:08:28.331
they go,

2612
01:08:28.331 --> 01:08:30.390
oh well we can't have porn on the website.

2613
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.930
And then so they took all,

2614
01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:32.641
like they,

2615
01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:33.510
I was making like,

2616
01:08:33.511 --> 01:08:37.470
I think I'm up to like $7,000 a month in just that Amazon stuff.

2617
01:08:37.471 --> 01:08:38.304
And they just took it all away.

2618
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.163
Porn on your website?

2619
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:39.480
No,

2620
01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.720
it's just because it was death squad and like there was like an episode that had

2621
01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:45.930
a girl on it that was a porn star and so they'd probably just went there and was

2622
01:08:45.931 --> 01:08:46.500
all you need.

2623
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.010
Yeah.

2624
01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:47.990
Fuck wow.

2625
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:49.980
You want me to can like bank off of that shit.

2626
01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:50.490
Yeah.

2627
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:51.480
You ever tried to get back in?

2628
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:52.343
I need to.

2629
01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:53.583
I'm on Amazon.

2630
01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.410
I'm on Amazon.

2631
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:56.671
Look it up.

2632
01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:57.504
You fucks.

2633
01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:57.691
Now.

2634
01:08:57.691 --> 01:08:59.910
Didn't apple come up with a bunch of new shit today?

2635
01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:03.360
Apple came out with a 12 inch iPad,

2636
01:09:03.361 --> 01:09:03.511
which,

2637
01:09:03.511 --> 01:09:04.800
so it's called an iPad pro,

2638
01:09:04.801 --> 01:09:05.551
which is a,

2639
01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:06.990
it's just like a laptop.

2640
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.420
I'd like 12 inch laptop without a keyboard.

2641
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:09.990
Uh,

2642
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:14.990
they also came with the iPhone six s which has a better front facing camera now.

2643
01:09:15.121 --> 01:09:16.510
It's got a better processor.

2644
01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:18.600
It's got the touch three d touch.

2645
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:19.463
What's that called?

2646
01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:19.891
Uh,

2647
01:09:19.891 --> 01:09:21.240
will reacts when you touch it.

2648
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:21.910
Yeah.

2649
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:22.130
Yeah.

2650
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.963
You can feel it.

2651
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.113
Um,

2652
01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:26.190
they also released a new apple TV,

2653
01:09:26.191 --> 01:09:29.670
which is the thing that I am the most interested in because it is now,

2654
01:09:29.671 --> 01:09:30.630
it plays games.

2655
01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:31.464
It does apps,

2656
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:34.350
and it's the first one to actually,

2657
01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.050
in the future you're going to have a Joe Rogan app finally.

2658
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.910
So when you're opening up your TV,

2659
01:09:38.911 --> 01:09:39.210
you're like,

2660
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:39.411
oof.

2661
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:40.244
CNN.

2662
01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:40.591
Oh,

2663
01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:41.100
Netflix.

2664
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:41.850
Oh Joe Rogan.

2665
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:42.900
So it's going to be like that.

2666
01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:43.620
So it's,

2667
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:44.580
so it's going to,

2668
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:48.450
it's the first step into completely destroying the cable industry,

2669
01:09:48.451 --> 01:09:48.780
I think.

2670
01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2671
01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.370
Wow.

2672

All the time.

2675
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:54.840
I use Netflix on it.

2676
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.220
It has HBO go on it.

2677
01:09:56.221 --> 01:09:57.300
You can get to those things

2678
01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.130
<v 2>which shows like narco or whatever,</v>

2679
01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.320
that you don't need anything on regular TV anymore.

2680
01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:03.880

They all have scar face pictures.

A lot of booty shots.

2732

2759
01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.240

You've got to have a scar face picture.

2761
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:02.550

There's quite a few of these.

2767
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:06.670
Got a pet tiger down there.

2768

01:12:33.941 --> 01:12:36.030
It's only 614 likes.

2785
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:36.864
How rude.

2786
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:41.150
That deserves a lot more likes and is a great picture and either manage to do

2787
01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:41.970
with no nipples.

How?

2789
01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:42.984
Yeah,

2790
01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:44.123

2791
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:45.083
Big titties.

2792
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:46.620
Those are juicy titties

2793

2794
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:50.670
My worst nightmare.

2795
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:51.120
Haha.

2796
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:51.271

but these guys are out of their fucking mind.

2799
01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:57.451
I mean,

2800
01:12:57.451 --> 01:12:58.770
this is the life they're living.

2801
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.350
They're living this nutty narco life.

2802
01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:04.350
The amount of drug money that's in Mexico right now is,

2803
01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:06.300
she's fucking insane.

2804
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.790
They're making billions.

2805
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.540
Look at that girl's house down at that kind of bottom.

2806
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.070
Look at that girl's ass.

2807
01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:12.190
Jesus.

2808
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:13.343
Jesus,

2809
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.333
his dad's.

2810
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:15.481
What?

2811
01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:16.500
A fucking APP.

2812
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:17.460
That can't be real.

2813
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.530
That's a fake one.

2814
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.850
That's a fake gas,

2815
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:22.283
but whatever.

2816
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:23.700
There's a lot of that lately.

2817
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:24.540
Yeah,

2818
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.620
it was in Vegas last week.

2819
01:13:25.621 --> 01:13:26.930
I saw a lot of fake asses.

2820
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:28.590
Girls getting carried away.

2821
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:29.640
That's the new thing,

2822
01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:30.150
man.

2823
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:30.361
You know,

2824
01:13:30.361 --> 01:13:33.990
like they had like giant tits and the 90s were like really popular.

2825
01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:34.651
Girls would just get,

2826
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:36.150
tits are way too big.

2827
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.250
That's what they're doing now with their houses.

2828
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.560
And like they don't match your legs at all.

2829
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:44.660
You have the legs of a lazy girl and the ass of a fucking major league pulled

2830
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.133
falter.

2831
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:49.200
Like some grow can jump over the moon bags of weed.

2832
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:50.280
Look about shitty weed.

2833
01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:50.761
Let me see this.

2834
01:13:50.761 --> 01:13:52.980
We'd see ladies and gentlemen,

2835
01:13:52.981 --> 01:13:53.791
if weed was legal,

2836
01:13:53.791 --> 01:13:55.410
this guy would not be making this kind of money.

2837
01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.193
Simple.

2838
01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:58.043
But it's true.

2839
01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.130
It doesn't look that good.

2840
01:13:59.190 --> 01:13:59.640
It's true.

2841
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.720
This is what happened to,

2842
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:01.350
uh,

2843
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:03.150
you could tell good weed from just the bags.

2844
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:03.361
Oh,

2845
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:03.990
100%.

2846
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.141
Yeah,

2847
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:04.621
that's shit.

2848
01:14:04.621 --> 01:14:04.890
Weed.

2849
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:05.011
Yeah,

2850
01:14:05.011 --> 01:14:05.281
I see.

2851
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:06.900
It looks like leaves and stems.

2852
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:07.571
Well,

2853
01:14:07.571 --> 01:14:08.260
it's just,

2854
01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.420
it's just not American.

2855
01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:10.830
California and we'd all right,

2856
01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:11.680
we do it the best out here.

2857
01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:12.610
We have botanists,

2858
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.361
right?

2859
01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:13.711
The grown,

2860
01:14:13.711 --> 01:14:14.810
that is avocado growers,

2861
01:14:14.811 --> 01:14:15.700
grower's making that shit.

2862
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.291
But these,

2863
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:17.830
uh,

2864
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:18.431
these dudes,

2865
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:20.110
there's a ton of these pages.

2866
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.370
They're fun to watch.

2867
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:23.680
There's a guy makes a holster.

2868
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:23.870
Well,

2869
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:24.940
you see the cup holder,

2870
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.680
there's a cup holder holster.

2871
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.920
It pulls your cup holder off and it fits right in place.

2872
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:30.760
And then it's a,

2873
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.910
it's like an actual click in holster for the gun.

2874
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.871
Yeah,

2875
01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:35.704
for pistol.

2876
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.040
Look at that two days.

2877
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:41.070
Did he say it's okay,

2878
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.390
I've got a gun point at a deck you might want to unload that.

2879
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:48.910
It's interesting this culture that has kind of come out of nowhere.

2880
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:49.480
He says,

2881
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.313
when I was a kid,

2882
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:51.940
I mean shit man,

2883
01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:54.550
fucking 15 years ago used to be able to go to Cancun.

2884
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.301
You go to Mexico,

2885
01:14:55.301 --> 01:14:59.410
nobody thought about like gang violence from drug dealers in Mexico.

2886
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.820
He didn't think about it at all.

2887
01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:06.220
Well it was this going on at this level or is it now just the Internet is giving

2888
01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:08.800
us a window into what was always kind of there.

2889
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.720
Now the world of drug dealers in Mexico has changed radically over the last

2890
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:13.721
couple of decades.

2891
01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:14.554
Radically.

2892
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.730
That's pretty established.

2893
01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:18.310
I mean he definitely always had something going on down there.

2894
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:18.971
There was always something,

2895
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:20.770
but guys like El Chapo,

2896
01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:25.810
like that crazy fucker that got out of jail by digging a tunnel that's a mile

2897
01:15:25.811 --> 01:15:28.040
long with an electric scooter inside.

2898
01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.740
And I'm going to find that guy that's,

2899
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.190
he's figured out how to get away now,

2900
01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.690
but he paid,

2901
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.090
he paid millions of dollars to have the fucking tunnel.

2902
01:15:37.091 --> 01:15:37.301
Me,

2903
01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:38.410
you're not going to find him.

2904
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:39.850
Beautiful panel till.

2905
01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:43.480
I mean just because I had had everything I think at an air conditioning down

2906
01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:44.880
there lights,

2907
01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.340
beautiful.

2908
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.150
It had lights,

2909
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.450
the ventilation figured out how to put that dot.

2910
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.560
Electric bike.

2911
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:52.780
So it would just zip out of there quick.

2912
01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:53.770
So once he got in there,

2913
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.813
he was gone,

2914
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.331
you know,

2915
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:57.310
and they're waiting for him a mile away in the house.

2916
01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:59.440
Tell me they didn't know that that was going on.

2917
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.030
How many people knew that that was going on?

2918
01:16:01.031 --> 01:16:03.910
How many times did they hear digging and they just kept their fucking mouth

2919
01:16:03.911 --> 01:16:04.744
shut?

2920
01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:05.251
Well,

2921
01:16:05.251 --> 01:16:08.020
I mean it was somebody else's house that he popped out of.

2922
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:09.610
Yeah,

2923
01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:11.890
it took a year to dig that tunnel too.

2924
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:13.361
I mean,

2925
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:14.021
it's hilarious.

2926
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:16.840
The guy just goes into the hole in the ground where the shitter is.

2927
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.860
He's got a little tiny wall like this high so that you can't see him taking a

2928
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:23.500
shit so that you couldn't see the hole being dug either.

2929
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.110
And then rate goes right in and that's it.

2930
01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:26.711
All she wrote,

2931
01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:27.544
he's gone.

2932
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.713
That's amazing.

2933
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.613
Yeah.

2934
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:29.831
Yeah.

2935
01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:32.290
The whole world exists because of illegal drugs.

2936
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.030
If drugs were legal in this country,

2937
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:38.470
there wouldn't be this gigantic demand and this ability to make insane amounts

2938
01:16:38.471 --> 01:16:40.900
of money from these cartels just he was all,

2939
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.880
but you make drugs legal in the United States,

2940
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:43.270
right?

2941
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.103
Does it,

2942
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.780
does the usage spike or no,

2943
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.010
not according to other countries.

2944
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.090
Not according to Portugal.

2945
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.710
Portugal decriminalize everything.

2946
01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:53.690
And they saw a giant drop in HIV infection,

2947
01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.210
giant drop in violent crime,

2948
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:56.770
giant drop an addiction.

2949
01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.551
It's all,

2950
01:16:57.551 --> 01:16:59.640
you can't tell people what to do when,

2951
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:01.390
if we were this room,

2952
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.740
this is my example,

2953
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:06.380
if this room was the whole world or the guys in this room and uh,

2954
01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.470
we were all hanging around and Brian Waters smoke weed and we're like,

2955
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:09.801
hey man,

2956
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:10.700
we got fucking laws.

2957
01:17:10.701 --> 01:17:11.451
You can't smoke weed,

2958
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:12.350
we're going to lock you in jail.

2959
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.160
That's what,

2960
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.030
that would be crazy,

2961
01:17:14.031 --> 01:17:14.440
right?

2962
01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:14.671
Who?

2963
01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:17.000
Who would we be to tell you what you can't do?

2964
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.800
That's the same thing with the world.

2965
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.660
We're all just adults.

2966
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.480
It's one thing whether or not she'd be legal for children.

2967
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.630
I don't think anything that fucks with your mind should be legal for kids.

2968
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.261
You know?

2969
01:17:27.261 --> 01:17:27.950
Nothing.

2970
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:31.010
Even fucking energy drinks like monster energy drinks,

2971
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.761
red lines,

2972
01:17:31.761 --> 01:17:32.481
all those crazy things.

2973
01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:33.314
You shouldn't have the,

2974
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:34.580
when you're 14 years old,

2975
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:35.570
shouldn't give that to a kid.

2976
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:38.480
They'll drink it and get a goddamn heart attack that you shouldn't be able to

2977
01:17:38.481 --> 01:17:39.231
fuck with their mind.

2978
01:17:39.231 --> 01:17:40.430
They shouldn't be able to smoke cigarettes.

2979
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.140
They shouldn't be able to drink alcohol.

2980
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.200
All that stuff should be illegal for growing minds because it's dangerous,

2981
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.850
but once you become an adult,

2982
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:50.660
you are your as sovereign as I am.

2983
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.360
I should be able to decide what goes in my body,

2984
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:54.620
what I do with my body.

2985
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.820
As long as it's not hurting you,

2986
01:17:56.390 --> 01:18:00.200
anybody that tells you differently there is suppressing your freedom.

2987
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.400
That's it's that simple.

2988
01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.840
Do I think you should do heroine?

2989
01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:03.500
No.

2990
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:03.621
Two,

2991
01:18:03.621 --> 01:18:04.790
I think you should smoke meth.

2992
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:05.540
No,

2993
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.360
but if you want to do it a little fuck am I to tell you not to do it and it's

2994
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:09.230
none of my business.

2995
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:10.310
It's none of anybody.

2996
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:11.040
It's not my business.

2997
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:11.360
Tell you this.

2998
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.620
Not Chew Tobacco either.

2999
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:15.200
I think chewing tobacco is fucking terrible for you.

3000
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.320
I think smoking is terrible by all these things or does a lot of things that are

3001
01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:19.154
terrible for you.

3002
01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.080
Pills popping pills are terrible for you.

3003
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:22.940
Eating shitty food is terrible for you.

3004
01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.990
And watching this documentary on sugar right now and it's blowing me away,

3005
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.620
blowing me away of how much processed sugar is in just what the,

3006
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.270
what people think is health foods,

3007
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:33.710
health drinks.

3008
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:37.310
You know how much processed sugar is in people's diets.

3009
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:39.080
There's a lot of things that are bad for you,

3010
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.290
but it's up to you to decide what to do and what not to do.

3011
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:47.070
I think the problem is when companies lie about what things are good for you or

3012
01:18:47.071 --> 01:18:47.900
not good for you,

3013
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.240
like the tobacco company did for the longest,

3014
01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:51.201
longest time,

3015
01:18:51.201 --> 01:18:54.500
those tobacco companies lied about nicotine being addictive,

3016
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.820
cigarettes being addictive,

3017
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.960
they just lied.

3018
01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:58.820
And in order to keep making money,

3019
01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.650
that's bad.

3020
01:18:59.650 --> 01:18:59.870
You know,

3021
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:00.650
that's bad.

3022
01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:02.240
But once it's all out on the table,

3023
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:03.321
who gives a fuck?

3024
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:04.400
If you want to smoke cigarettes,

3025
01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:04.781
who am I?

3026
01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:05.870
And unless you're my friend,

3027
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.261
you know,

3028
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:08.030
I would try to talk you out of it if you're my friend.

3029
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:09.170
But if you're an adult,

3030
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.580
do whatever the fuck you want to do.

3031
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:12.050
And I think it should be that with everything.

3032
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:13.250
Everything.

3033
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.020
Everything across the board.

3034
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.410
When it comes to drugs or,

3035
01:19:18.411 --> 01:19:18.651
I mean,

3036
01:19:18.651 --> 01:19:18.830
what,

3037
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:19.110
what,

3038
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:20.450
where does the laws come in?

3039
01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.900
I think prostitution,

3040
01:19:21.901 --> 01:19:22.734
same thing.

3041
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.530
I think drugs and prostitution.

3042
01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:26.510
The two stupidest fucking things to make illegal,

3043
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:30.110
especially prostitution because it's legal to be promiscuous.

3044
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:33.680
It's legal for a girl to just have sex with as many guys as she wants.

3045
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.460
A girl could go to the Mondrian tonight and just suck 50 Dick's and no one could

3046
01:19:37.461 --> 01:19:38.660
say a goddamn thing about it.

3047
01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.710
She can come downstairs.

3048
01:19:39.711 --> 01:19:40.221
Who's next?

3049
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:40.671
Who's next,

3050
01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:41.504
who wants to do this?

3051
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.220
But as soon as she starts getting paid for that,

3052
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.380
then it's illegal.

3053
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:46.663
That's stupid.

3054
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:47.533
It's stupid.

3055
01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:48.710
It's dumb.

3056
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:51.200
Willie defund the Geto boys said it best.

3057
01:19:51.201 --> 01:19:52.011
You got to let a hoby.

3058
01:19:52.011 --> 01:19:52.844
Oh,

3059
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.320
he said that shit in the early nineties test them having tests like porn stars

3060
01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.690
like once a month or once every 15 days.

3061
01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:01.130
Get a sex sex test.

3062
01:20:01.131 --> 01:20:02.150
They have to use condoms.

3063
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.721
I mean,

3064
01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:04.010
if you can trade a,

3065
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:04.850
you know,

3066
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:06.140
a Taco for sex,

3067
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:08.060
he should be able to trade $100 for a sec.

3068
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:10.710
It's says exactly.

3069
01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:12.420
You take a girl out to dinner and she fucks you.

3070
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:14.460
I mean a girl that normally wouldn't fuck you.

3071
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:15.031
What is that?

3072
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:16.140
Is that prostitution?

3073
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.250
It kind of is.

3074
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.200
You buy her a nice gifts and she blows you.

3075
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.070
What is that?

3076
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:24.090
Is that prostitution which she have blown you with without that Nice Watch you

3077
01:20:24.091 --> 01:20:24.720
bought her?

3078
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.410
Probably not.

3079
01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:28.110
I know a lot of models that get paid to like 20,

3080
01:20:28.111 --> 01:20:29.680
they'll get 20 models taking,

3081
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:31.630
send them to a party and uh,

3082
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.070
you know,

3083
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:34.320
they're just there to make the party look hot.

3084
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.661
You know what?

3085
01:20:34.661 --> 01:20:35.490
I'm pretty,

3086
01:20:35.490 --> 01:20:36.480
but if they sleep with one,

3087
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:37.980
some of somebody at the party,

3088
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:38.850
it's the same thing.

3089
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:39.210
It's like,

3090
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:39.420
you know,

3091
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.021
being a prostate,

3092
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:42.150
they got paid to be at this party,

3093
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.070
but it's their choice.

3094
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.680
They're not exchanging money directly for,

3095
01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:46.533
for sex.

3096
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:47.431
And if they are,

3097
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:48.480
then it becomes illegal.

3098
01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:49.830
It's fucking stupid.

3099
01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:50.581
It's stupid.

3100
01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:51.480
It's just sex.

3101
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.770
Sex is great.

3102
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.610
She'd be able to buy it spilled by just like you can buy a massage.

3103
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:57.900
How come you can buy a haircut?

3104
01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.250
He can't buy a blowjob.

3105
01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:00.900
It doesn't make any sense.

3106
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.800
It makes sense.

3107
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.730
It's a service.

3108
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:03.361
It is.

3109
01:21:03.361 --> 01:21:03.661
I mean,

3110
01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:05.040
it shouldn't always be a service.

3111
01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:06.300
Like if you love someone,

3112
01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:07.140
you want to have sex with them.

3113
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:08.430
That's not the same,

3114
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:08.940
you know?

3115
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.910
But the idea that sex is only for love,

3116
01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.740
that's some pure bullshit.

3117
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:14.730
It's stupid.

3118
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.220
She be able to do whatever you want guys and girls,

3119
01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:17.881
you know,

3120
01:21:17.881 --> 01:21:18.714
everybody.

3121
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:21.323
The girl,

3122
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.420
the girl that we were talking about that Tommy buttons and I was talking about,

3123
01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:25.230
um,

3124
01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:25.651
we were,

3125
01:21:25.651 --> 01:21:26.040
uh,

3126
01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.360
Ian Edwards and I were in Vegas and we're coming back and we ran into this girl

3127
01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:35.361
that Ian knows and she was a stripper and she had coffee with us at the airport,

3128
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.430
the little a coffee bean thing.

3129
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:42.060
And she was talking about working at the Rhino and that this guy told the story

3130
01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:44.490
the other day that this girl that she was with said,

3131
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:44.700
uh,

3132
01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.990
how lucrative do you get?

3133
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.701
She goes,

3134
01:21:47.701 --> 01:21:47.941
what do you,

3135
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:48.540
what do you mean?

3136
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.310
She goes,

3137
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:51.090
if Dude's give me a lot of money,

3138
01:21:51.091 --> 01:21:52.380
I'll be getting lucrative.

3139
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.600
I go back to their hotel.

3140
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.090
So that became like all weekend.

3141
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.031
I mean all,

3142
01:21:58.031 --> 01:21:58.771
all flight back.

3143
01:21:58.771 --> 01:21:59.970
How lucrative do you get?

3144
01:21:59.971 --> 01:22:00.804
How liquid it,

3145
01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.620
she was talking about her husband who lets guys fuck him.

3146
01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:05.730
He's gay for pay.

3147
01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:06.450
He'll like,

3148
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:08.190
like five guys run a train on them,

3149
01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:10.110
but they have to give him like a lot of money.

3150
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.900
That should be legal.

3151
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:14.890
It should be goddamn league,

3152
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.900
I don't think would,

3153
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:18.403
if you were gay,

3154
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:19.411
gay,

3155
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:21.870
you would love it if you would love it.

3156
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:24.780
If you could pay some guy and fucking have him blow you,

3157
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:25.950
he'd be all excited.

3158
01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:26.881
You should be able to do it.

3159
01:22:26.881 --> 01:22:27.720
If that's what you want,

3160
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.360
there's no one should be able to stop that.

3161
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:35.250
If there's a only this for people in this room and Jamie wants to pay you for

3162
01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:36.084
head,

3163
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:36.671
gets it for,

3164
01:22:36.671 --> 01:22:37.170
for you,

3165
01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:37.970
you want,

3166
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:38.880
you want to blow him.

3167
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:39.751
Why?

3168
01:22:39.751 --> 01:22:40.710
Why should that be bad?

3169
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.600
It's supposed to fucking childish.

3170
01:22:42.601 --> 01:22:43.290
We're we're,

3171
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:45.750
this is all some ancient puritan stupidity.

3172
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.471
That's all it is.

3173
01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:49.920
It's just some ancient stupid shit that people have been clinging to forever.

3174
01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:52.080
No one should be able to tell anybody what to do.

3175
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:52.914
If it doesn't hurt you,

3176
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.420
it doesn't hurt somebody else,

3177
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:55.730
but it doesn't hurt other people.

3178
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:57.060
You're not victimizing anybody.

3179
01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.920
It's one thing like the sex industry,

3180
01:22:58.921 --> 01:22:59.671
like you know,

3181
01:22:59.671 --> 01:23:02.880
like a sex slaves and underaged sex.

3182
01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:03.210
Pete,

3183
01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:06.070
that's a totally different story like exploitation.

3184
01:23:06.071 --> 01:23:07.390
That's a totally different story,

3185
01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.460
but some girl who just wants to get a lucrative,

3186
01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:10.920
lucrative to you.

3187
01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.753
Yeah,

3188
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:14.050
cause that'd be getting a lucrative,

3189
01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.013
<v 0>okay.</v>

3190
01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:20.810
<v 1>Do whatever you want.</v>

3191
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:22.070
We'll live in a,

3192
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:23.420
we're a bunch of babies,

3193
01:23:23.421 --> 01:23:24.830
a bunch of grown up babies.

3194
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:26.360
You don't fuck around with drugs at all.

3195
01:23:26.361 --> 01:23:26.910
Huh?

3196
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:27.260
Ah,

3197
01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:27.681
listen,

3198
01:23:27.681 --> 01:23:27.811
I,

3199
01:23:27.811 --> 01:23:28.820
I've done pot.

3200
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:29.973
Is it

3201
01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.813
<v 0>pat?</v>

3202
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:39.180
Pat and college should meet every once in a while we'll fire it up and let

3203
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.790
somebody know when the last time,

3204
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.090
the last time you got stuff that nobody else has.

3205
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:47.451
What is that?

3206
01:23:47.451 --> 01:23:50.650
Is it the only time I'd seen a cork was in wine.

3207
01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:52.660
If you got it out of the smell,

3208
01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:53.111
just smell.

3209
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:53.531
You get hard.

3210
01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:56.430
You're smelling that joint as a filter.

3211
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.420
Ah,

3212
01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.313
man.

3213
01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.230
<v 1>That's real weed.</v>

3214
01:24:01.231 --> 01:24:02.011
That's American.

3215
01:24:02.011 --> 01:24:03.660
We'd got damaged from California.

3216
01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.820
You never used to do this,

3217
01:24:05.821 --> 01:24:06.061
right?

3218
01:24:06.061 --> 01:24:07.620
You've never used to be a pot guy.

3219
01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.690
When we were hanging out at the comedy store two thousand two thousand years,

3220
01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:12.550
that's when I started at use.

3221
01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:13.351
You flipped over,

3222
01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:13.580
right?

3223
01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.413
Yeah.

3224
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:15.480
Then no smells good.

3225
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.350
15 years.

3226
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:17.670
15 years of steady,

3227
01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.050
steady pot of beauty.

3228
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.280
So you smoked pot every day?

3229
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.940
No.

3230
01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:21.330
No.

3231
01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:22.163
Whenever I want to.

3232
01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:23.401
Well,

3233
01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:24.230
what does it do for you?

3234
01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:24.871
What do I mean?

3235
01:24:24.871 --> 01:24:25.561
Like other things,

3236
01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.760
it makes me more creative.

3237
01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:27.480
Um,

3238
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.201
makes me,

3239
01:24:28.201 --> 01:24:28.980
um,

3240
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.320
it makes me relaxed.

3241
01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:31.530
Makes food taste better.

3242
01:24:31.531 --> 01:24:32.790
Makes sex feel better.

3243
01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.440
Makes movies more interesting.

3244
01:24:34.441 --> 01:24:37.340
I love to watch documentaries or get a little baked watch.

3245
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:38.550
Documentaries get nervous.

3246
01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.033
Wow.

3247
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:40.960
Yeah.

3248
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.000
It makes me creative.

3249
01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:42.834
I'll tell you that.

3250
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:44.850
I come up with a lot of crazy ideas when I'm high,

3251
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:46.200
like some of my best ideas,

3252
01:24:46.201 --> 01:24:46.741
I come up with them.

3253
01:24:46.741 --> 01:24:47.330
Hi,

3254
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:49.530
I'm just take a hit and see what happens when you try it.

3255
01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.473
<v 0>Well,</v>

3256
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.943
no,

3257
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:55.180
I feel like I might have that.

3258
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:56.500
You're right.

3259
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.000
I couldn't drive home.

3260
01:24:58.150 --> 01:24:58.361
Oh,

3261
01:24:58.361 --> 01:24:59.194
you definitely could

3262
01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:01.490
help us.

3263
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:02.323
Will be out.

3264
01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:04.420
They'll drive right to Melrose

3265
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:08.743
here yesterday.

3266
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:10.331
I swear.

3267
01:25:10.331 --> 01:25:12.880
I remember it like every once in a while.

3268
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:13.390
Wouldn't do it.

3269
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.631
Just,

3270
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:13.901
you know,

3271
01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:14.670
if it's there,

3272
01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.030
<v 1>well me and my wife do it.</v>

3273
01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:16.291
Yeah.

3274
01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:17.310
That's when it's fun.

3275
01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:18.150
Do it.

3276
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:19.740
You and the wife don't get crazy.

3277
01:25:19.741 --> 01:25:20.574
You don't get paranoid.

3278
01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.910
Take like one hit and you have the best sex ever.

3279
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:24.450
You're like rediscover each other.

3280
01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.410
So I love it.

3281
01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:26.340
Especially edibles.

3282
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:27.820
Edible.

3283
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.351
It's not,

3284
01:25:28.351 --> 01:25:29.700
don't get terrified.

3285
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.691
You know this,

3286
01:25:30.691 --> 01:25:31.920
you know I have a little piece.

3287
01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:32.420

3297
01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:38.953

3303
01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:45.171
Well,

3304
01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:45.741
after the show,

3305
01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:46.341
we'll hook them up.

3306
01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.390
We've got a bunch of stuff here.

3307
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.820
Yeah,

3308
01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:48.041
yeah,

3309
01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:49.340
I can hear people keep giving it to me.

3310
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:50.300
I got a bunch of good stuff.

3311
01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:51.480
He's Jambo.

3312
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.520
He's the shit right here.

3313
01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:53.230

That's for you.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.190
Don't get crazy though.

3322
01:26:04.191 --> 01:26:06.740
Don't eat edibles.

3323

but I will warn you right now.

3330

Gentle baby steps like one oh two don't even eat the whole thing.

3331
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:18.840
Okay,

3332
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.090
well just take little bites.

3333
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:20.953
Find your way.

3334

Find your way.

3335
01:26:21.411 --> 01:26:22.244
Grasshopper.

3336
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:23.530
How about this shit.

3337
01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.713
Do this shit.

3338
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.593
What's that?

3339
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.390
Consume half a chapel for the first time.

3340
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:30.260
What's that?

3341
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:30.790
What is that?

3342
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:32.570
Supercharged butter.

3343
01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.250
Just butter.

3344
01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:34.460
She's,

3345
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:34.591
what?

3346
01:26:34.591 --> 01:26:35.390
Did you put this on?

3347
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:37.460
Toast and the popcorn.

3348
01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:38.141
Yes,

3349
01:26:38.141 --> 01:26:38.974
you do.

3350
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:41.110
Put that on your popcorn.

3351
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.380
You fucking go right to Pluto.

3352
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.950
Yeah.

3353
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.900
Go See star wars from the new star wars comes out.

3354
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:47.300
Put that melt that butter.

3355
01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:48.134
Bring it with you.

3356
01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.760
Just use it and look at the old one.

3357
01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.353
The new one.

3358
01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.500
Start Wells to become,

3359
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.191
you'll be like,

3360
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:56.050
first of all in this movie,

3361
01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:56.631
it's fake.

3362
01:26:56.631 --> 01:26:57.464
It's fuck.

3363
01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.540
But when you take that home to really surprise me.

3364
01:27:01.541 --> 01:27:02.374
So Chantelle,

3365
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.190
this is just a NIB,

3366
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.300
like a fingernail,

3367
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:06.370
like a pinky finger.

3368
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:06.980
Now,

3369
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:07.940
like a pinky nail.

3370
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.330
All right?

3371
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:09.770
That's the size piece you want to try.

3372
01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.280
Okay.

3373
01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.150
Don't get crazy.

3374
01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:12.261
I'm not kidding,

3375
01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:12.520
man.

3376
01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.240
These theses and will fuck you up,

3377
01:27:14.241 --> 01:27:14.750
man.

3378
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.901
Wow,

3379
01:27:14.901 --> 01:27:15.420
this is great.

3380
01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.590
Has MCT coconut oil in it and it's grass fed.

3381
01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:18.771
Well,

3382
01:27:18.771 --> 01:27:19.351
Jambo is,

3383
01:27:19.351 --> 01:27:21.680
is my favorite because these guys are making,

3384
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:22.730
it's all organic,

3385
01:27:22.731 --> 01:27:23.361
all healthy,

3386
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:24.590
no processed sugar,

3387
01:27:24.591 --> 01:27:26.060
no high fructose corn syrup.

3388
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:31.300
Everything they make is like very good for you and puts you on fucking Ludo

3389
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:33.500
gluten free till that's right.

3390
01:27:33.501 --> 01:27:34.334
Bitch.

3391
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.450
No gluten,

3392
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.830
no can.

3393
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:36.471
You don't want gluten.

3394
01:27:36.471 --> 01:27:37.880
When you getting so high you want to die.

3395
01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.440
It's the last thing you want to do is be thinking about the gluten.

3396
01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:43.910
I was doing so good.

3397
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.500
I think I'm going to go back to gluten free.

3398
01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.590
I got a fucking problem with pasta,

3399
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:49.130
dude.

3400
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:49.251
Well,

3401
01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:49.881
what's the problem?

3402
01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:51.590
Is the Guinea in me?

3403
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:52.640
Is it a stomach issue?

3404
01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:53.880
No,

3405
01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.770
it makes you fat.

3406
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.360
It did say it's not good for you.

3407
01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:57.693
There's,

3408
01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:00.500
I'm pretty objective about what happens when I eat food,

3409
01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:03.600
like some foods have a reaction that I don't necessarily like.

3410
01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:05.450
I don't like the physical reaction,

3411
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:06.320
like look,

3412
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.610
if I eat salads just like a nice healthy salad and a piece of steak or a piece

3413
01:28:10.611 --> 01:28:11.690
of meat or a piece of fish,

3414
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:12.673
I feel great.

3415
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.760
I have no problems,

3416
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:16.520
but if I eat like a big bowl of pasta,

3417
01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:17.030
like come up.

3418
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:21.620
I'm a sucker for like linguine with clams and brick and my stomach.

3419
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:24.230
It feels awesome when it's going down.

3420
01:28:24.231 --> 01:28:24.861
When I'm eating it,

3421
01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:25.694
I'm like,

3422
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.230
I can barely breathe.

3423
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:28.064
I'm just,

3424
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:30.980
it's so good.

3425
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:32.000
It's so good.

3426
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.080
But after it's over,

3427
01:28:33.081 --> 01:28:33.914
just like,

3428
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:35.000
well,

3429
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.461
your body,

3430
01:28:35.461 --> 01:28:39.770
your fucking insulin spiking and your body's trying to process all that dough

3431
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.890
that sit in the bottom of your stomach and your body just turns it into straight

3432
01:28:42.891 --> 01:28:43.340
sugar.

3433
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:43.551
I mean,

3434
01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:44.260
it's really,

3435
01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.190
you might as well be eating bowls or sugar.

3436
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:47.810
We need a big plate of pasta.

3437
01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:52.700
I had a sensitivity tests that are like a blood sensitivity and I have a

3438
01:28:52.701 --> 01:28:54.260
sensitivity to those products.

3439
01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:55.280
And when I do eat it,

3440
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:56.300
it's a problem.

3441
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.051
I listen.

3442
01:28:57.051 --> 01:28:57.470
I was,

3443
01:28:57.470 --> 01:29:01.770
how was eating cheese breads pasta for and

3444
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:07.020
<v 2>bloatedness and I don't mean to get grant gas like you wouldn't believe.</v>

3445
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:08.693
And I just thought,

3446
01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.091
all right,

3447
01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:10.240
this is part of aging.

3448
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:13.330
It's just ripping among,

3449
01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:13.591
okay,

3450
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:16.470
this is what the w what happens when you become 40?

3451
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:20.010
So I want to get the test and I eliminated out of the Diet.

3452
01:29:20.011 --> 01:29:22.500
I dropped some weight and I don't have that.

3453
01:29:23.410 --> 01:29:23.700
You know,

3454
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:24.241
like you're saying,

3455
01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:25.230
you have a nice salad,

3456
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.310
nice steak.

3457
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:27.173
It's nice.

3458
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.620
You don't feel exhausted.

3459
01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:28.921
But,

3460
01:29:28.921 --> 01:29:29.490
uh,

3461
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:30.510
I have a bowl of pasta.

3462
01:29:30.511 --> 01:29:31.150
Forget it.

3463
01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:31.600
Um,

3464
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.433
I'm napping.

3465
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.130
It's so good though.

3466
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.730
Brad is so good.

3467
01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.200
Fuck when they come,

3468
01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:39.210
when you go to an Italian restaurant and they come with that bread,

3469
01:29:39.211 --> 01:29:43.200
they get their basket of bread and the bread sticks and the fucking the olive

3470
01:29:43.201 --> 01:29:43.650
oil.

3471
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:44.281
Oh,

3472
01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:45.114
forget it.

3473
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.140
Forget it.

3474
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.490
But it's just so bad for you.

3475
01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:47.941
I mean,

3476
01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:49.620
it's not the worst shit in the world for you,

3477
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:53.730
but I think I'm going to give myself just a cheat day a week and then for the

3478
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:54.511
rest of the week,

3479
01:29:54.511 --> 01:29:57.000
I think I'm just avoiding gluten from now on.

3480
01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:57.530
I'm going to,

3481
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.691
well,

3482
01:29:57.691 --> 01:30:00.240
just someone avoid breads and processed sugars.

3483
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.100
Yeah.

3484
01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:01.490
Just,

3485
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:02.080
uh,

3486
01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.420
I work out so much and I'm tag take such good care of my body that those things

3487
01:30:06.421 --> 01:30:07.770
that when I do those things,

3488
01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.170
I'm going to limit my alcohol consumption to,

3489
01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.930
I'm going to limit my alcohol consumption to one day a week.

3490
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.120
I've cut mine in half in the last two weeks.

3491
01:30:15.121 --> 01:30:15.721
So like 50,

3492
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:16.560
60 drinks a week.

3493
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:18.330
Now we need 80 drinks.

3494
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.440
What's your drunk you like a goto ginger

3495
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:24.983
Ginger Ale.

3496
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.823
That's your shit.

3497
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:26.101
Yeah.

3498
01:30:26.101 --> 01:30:26.400
Ginger.

3499
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.450
A house up his stomach.

3500
01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.231
So bad drink.

3501
01:30:28.231 --> 01:30:29.070
Let's get a drink right now.

3502
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.353
Fuck it.

3503
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:34.500
I'm going the other way.

3504
01:30:34.501 --> 01:30:35.700
I'm just going to drink till I die.

3505
01:30:35.701 --> 01:30:37.140
I'm going to go back Koski style.

3506
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.630
Just fucking get a big fat there for a while.

3507
01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.013
Were you

3508
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:43.650
deep drinking?

3509
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:46.460
Like you got to get off this cancer sticks kid.

3510
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:47.533
Yeah,

3511
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:53.470
but drinking was way more like I've been destroying myself drinking like the

3512
01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:55.260
last six months.

3513
01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.580
Is it just hanging out at the store,

3514
01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.750
hanging out the store?

3515
01:30:57.751 --> 01:30:58.870
Did you know that?

3516
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.780
Just the Shit I've been dealing with.

3517
01:31:00.781 --> 01:31:01.201
Have you just like,

3518
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:01.621
fuck it.

3519
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:03.060
I'm just going all in drinking,

3520
01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:05.933
but uh,

3521
01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:06.301
no.

3522
01:31:06.301 --> 01:31:07.890
And then being out of it,

3523
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:09.990
what's really nice is waking up though and just go like,

3524
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:10.351
oh yeah,

3525
01:31:10.351 --> 01:31:11.670
I don't have a hangover.

3526
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:12.181
I forgot.

3527
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:13.350
That's so great.

3528
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:17.160
I thought that this morning I've been waking up at seven in the morning for this

3529
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:17.161
morning.

3530
01:31:17.161 --> 01:31:17.994
I woke up,

3531
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.510
got the girls ready for school and then took a yoga class and I feel like a

3532
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:22.344
winner.

3533
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:27.530
I just feel like I've that beverages at night to there.

3534
01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:28.890
It's hard to have to call me.

3535
01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:29.250
Sorry.

3536
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.810
I just stopped going to the comedy store half the time now.

3537
01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:32.730
Yeah.

3538
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:33.720
You know what though man,

3539
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:35.640
I'll go and smoke a little weed and drink water.

3540
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:37.050
I do that,

3541
01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:37.560
you know,

3542
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.620
cause the weed just doesn't affect,

3543
01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:39.870
especially those vapor pens.

3544
01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.370
I love vapor pens now.

3545
01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:42.960
That's my new way to do it too man.

3546
01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:44.790
No coughing,

3547
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:45.511
no nothing,

3548
01:31:45.511 --> 01:31:46.440
no weirdness.

3549
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.800
And,

3550
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.870
and then the ones that fucking Gino has,

3551
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.810
that man has good products.

3552
01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:52.620
He just,

3553
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.260
I just did a playboy interview for,

3554
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:55.320
for him or with him,

3555
01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:55.800
uh,

3556
01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.560
for his business and he showed me all these new products.

3557
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.970
He has these pins where

3558
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:00.540
<v 1>it,</v>

3559
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:00.790
you know,

3560
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:04.750
rechargeable batteries and you just buy a new tank and it's 500 hits per tank.

3561
01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:06.640
And I think he said it was like 40 bucks or something.

3562
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.870
It's so much better.

3563
01:32:07.871 --> 01:32:12.160
And you could just do it in public because it doesn't smell like smells like

3564
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:12.994
strawberries.

3565
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:14.090
Smelly strawberries.

3566
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:14.620
Yeah.

3567
01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:17.890
People think you're smoking some sort of a tobacco product and the glass tips

3568
01:32:17.891 --> 01:32:19.510
that he says once you go glass tip,

3569
01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:23.020
it's really hard to go back to like those little paper ones when you're just,

3570
01:32:23.021 --> 01:32:23.240
it's,

3571
01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:26.140
it's like you start getting spoiled and last tips.

3572
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:27.450
Let me tell you something about glass steps.

3573
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.900
When I grew up in fucking North Bergen,

3574
01:32:28.901 --> 01:32:29.560
New Jersey,

3575
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.460
there was no glass deck.

3576
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.590
You're told you're fucking weed.

3577
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.060
When the League came your way,

3578
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:34.721
you talk what?

3579
01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:37.630
You got fucking kids and that glass tips.

3580
01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:38.890
I got a glass tip.

3581
01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:40.120
I'll stick it right up your ass.

3582
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.010
You fucking class tips.

3583
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:46.900
Nothing like doing an interview though with a publication like playboy and him

3584
01:32:46.901 --> 01:32:48.840
being so stone though that halfway through you're just,

3585
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:49.743
Huh?

3586
01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:50.620
What did I talk about?

3587
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.910
Did you get stone before you did the culture high before he did that interview?

3588
01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.093
All of them.

3589
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:59.680
I was sick before I did the culture I interview when I listened to it now I'm

3590
01:32:59.681 --> 01:32:59.801
like,

3591
01:32:59.801 --> 01:33:00.041
wow,

3592
01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.240
my voice is all fucked up.

3593
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:02.051
I was a,

3594
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:03.850
I was flying from Gig to Gig.

3595
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:06.700
I was in Edmonton doing standup when I did that.

3596
01:33:06.701 --> 01:33:08.230
That's a great documentary though.

3597
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.190
I just rewatched it.

3598
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:09.810
There it is.

3599
01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:10.870
Fucking dead guy.

3600
01:33:10.871 --> 01:33:12.670
Adam score Gorgie he knows what the fuck on bread.

3601
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:13.504
They know what they're doing.

3602
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.733
They nailed it.

3603
01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:15.640
What's it called?

3604
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.170
It's called the culture high culture.

3605
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:18.551
Yeah,

3606
01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:18.941
it's about,

3607
01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:21.040
well they did this documentary called the union,

3608
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:22.630
which is all about the uh,

3609
01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.140
the,

3610
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:28.140
the business of marijuana in British Columbia and how it's so such a part of the

3611
01:33:28.361 --> 01:33:28.780
economy.

3612
01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:30.520
If you pulled wheat out of British Columbia,

3613
01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:31.840
the economy would fall apart.

3614
01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:33.063
Like the,

3615
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:33.970
like Vancouver,

3616
01:33:33.971 --> 01:33:36.760
like that area is almost entirely dependent upon weed.

3617
01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:38.740
It's a staple of their economy.

3618
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:40.060
And if you pulled it out of there,

3619
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:40.601
like the money,

3620
01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:41.470
they would be fucked.

3621
01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.600
And it just showed,

3622
01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:48.010
it highlighted the silliness about marijuana illegalization like how crazy it is

3623
01:33:48.011 --> 01:33:53.011
that grown adults can't have this one drug that has zero side effects.

3624
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.120
It doesn't kill anybody.

3625
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:59.200
This one drug that has all these medical benefits is one drug that helps all

3626
01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:04.201
these kids with autism and people with wasting disease and Glaucoma,

3627
01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:05.830
interocular pressure reliever,

3628
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:08.080
all these different things that it does for you and it's illegal.

3629
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.750
But then you look at all the stuff that is legal and how all this,

3630
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.040
the side effects of all the shit that marijuana would replace.

3631
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:16.270
That's fucking crazy.

3632
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.511
Well,

3633
01:34:16.511 --> 01:34:19.720
they went into it way deeper with the culture high and the culture hi just

3634
01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.720
showed how fucking insane it is and how much,

3635
01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.720
how much bullshit is being spread about like what we're,

3636
01:34:25.730 --> 01:34:27.670
what addiction really is.

3637
01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.470
Like people say that wheat is addictive,

3638
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:31.600
which is why I got so mad at fucking doctor drew.

3639
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:33.220
I call this addiction nonsense.

3640
01:34:33.221 --> 01:34:35.650
No physical addiction properties and marijuana.

3641
01:34:35.651 --> 01:34:39.280
It just doesn't exist with the addiction is the same addiction that you would

3642
01:34:39.281 --> 01:34:39.650
have.

3643
01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:41.380
You are addicted to anything,

3644
01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:45.610
whether it's gambling or jerking off or fucking people are addicted to all kinds

3645
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:46.360
of crazy shit.

3646
01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.200
Those thrill seekers,

3647
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:50.500
like that kid that was on that skateboard guaranteed that kid's addicted to

3648
01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:51.334
adrenaline.

3649
01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:51.941
Yeah.

3650
01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:55.150
I mean when you see that people though that smoked the marijuana where they're

3651
01:34:55.151 --> 01:34:57.920
like having a joint and have a second joint just for that.

3652
01:34:57.970 --> 01:34:59.060
If they didn't have joints,

3653
01:34:59.061 --> 01:34:59.894
it had been something else.

3654
01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:01.100
So that's not,

3655
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.530
it's unfair to tie that with food.

3656
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:04.423
Yeah.

3657
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.430
We know guys that are like that with food that literally they will stuff their

3658
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:09.140
fucking faces until they die.

3659
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.940
They just get addicted to food.

3660
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:11.990
Same.

3661
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:13.670
He passed by a Jack in the box.

3662
01:35:13.671 --> 01:35:14.504
They can't help it.

3663
01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.160
They find themselves in that drive in.

3664
01:35:16.161 --> 01:35:19.130
Their heart rate's increasing and they start ordering food.

3665
01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:21.230
They know they shouldn't eat raw.

3666
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:22.363
It's the same thing.

3667
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.290
People get addicted to shit.

3668
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.540
It's just a part of being a person,

3669
01:35:28.170 --> 01:35:28.700
you know,

3670
01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.410
to take it and taking that away from people.

3671
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:31.244
It's just stupid.

3672
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:33.050
You do what to do whatever you want.

3673
01:35:33.051 --> 01:35:33.590
If you want to,

3674
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:34.070
you know,

3675
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:36.080
you wanna fucking go pole vaulting.

3676
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:37.850
They want to walk on a tightrope.

3677
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:38.450
You can do it.

3678
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:39.350
You can do all that stuff.

3679
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:40.630
Do whatever you want saying.

3680
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:42.350
That's what I'm saying.

3681
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:43.041
Open and free.

3682
01:35:43.041 --> 01:35:43.640
You want it.

3683
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.990
You want to take a little cookie dough?

3684
01:35:44.991 --> 01:35:45.920
A little finger now.

3685
01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.020
Can't be careful with that though.

3686
01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.770
I don't want to see you in a week from now way you're talking about this.

3687
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.160
Yes.

3688
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.030
I ain't doing it

3689
01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:58.040
<v 0>cause cause my fingernail might be a longer than yours.</v>

3690
01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.940
I'll have a little bit and I'll be,

3691
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:02.240
uh,

3692
01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:02.681
I'll be,

3693
01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:02.950
uh,

3694
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:04.390
<v 1>convulsing in my driveway.</v>

3695
01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:06.040
Um,

3696
01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:06.873
you'll be fine.

3697
01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.980
Just been real nervous for awhile.

3698
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:12.160
Flowers I candy flip the other day by mistake.

3699
01:36:12.161 --> 01:36:13.720
I didn't know it was a candy flip.

3700
01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:15.010
I thought it was just ecstasy,

3701
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:17.890
but it was acid and ecstasy and wow.

3702
01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.210
Highly recommend that.

3703
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:20.350
That is cool.

3704
01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:20.821
You,

3705
01:36:20.821 --> 01:36:21.940
you don't tell that to the kids.

3706
01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.670
What about the children allegedly?

3707
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:27.010
See that's another thing.

3708
01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.090
How come that's not legal?

3709
01:36:28.210 --> 01:36:29.410
How can what you did is illegal.

3710
01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:29.771
I know.

3711
01:36:29.771 --> 01:36:32.950
Now it should be places where you can go and you could legally candy flip.

3712
01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:33.490
Yeah,

3713
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:34.271
like there's doctors.

3714
01:36:34.271 --> 01:36:36.190
They're padded walls.

3715
01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.020
The whole deal.

3716
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:37.630
It was great.

3717
01:36:37.630 --> 01:36:38.680
What a great combo.

3718
01:36:38.681 --> 01:36:42.670
Having hallucinogens with something that makes your body feel amazing.

3719
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:43.360
I mean,

3720
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.490
I just sat there and soaked in the girl the whole time.

3721
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:45.920
We're just like,

3722
01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.760
ah,

3723
01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:48.180
great.

3724
01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:49.290
You go look at that.

3725
01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:49.970
See,

3726
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:50.181
<v 0>hey,</v>

3727
01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:51.740
I'm learning stuff left and right.

3728
01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.850
Candy flip.

3729
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:53.420
He didn't hurt.

3730
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.253
You never heard about that.

3731
01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.510
I don't live in these circles.

3732
01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:56.901
Come on.

3733
01:36:56.901 --> 01:36:57.800
What circles do you live in?

3734
01:36:58.150 --> 01:36:58.983
What's your winners

3735
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:01.820
sitting around talking about nipple shirts,

3736
01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.080
furniture shopping with dice.

3737
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:09.230
It's the best thing you could do with your wife or girlfriend.

3738
01:37:09.231 --> 01:37:12.150
It's cause it's just like truth serum and then you put your ad,

3739
01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.860
the acid to eight and now it's like you're in Alice in wonderland.

3740
01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:16.730
Can't do this man.

3741
01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:17.751
Too much,

3742
01:37:17.751 --> 01:37:18.530
too much truth,

3743
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:19.070
too much,

3744
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:20.300
and it's just too much going on.

3745
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:21.000
This is,

3746
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.730
I've always had a fear of doing any of these things because I feel the time I do

3747
01:37:25.731 --> 01:37:25.970
it,

3748
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:28.370
my body reacts to it and people are going to go,

3749
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:30.350
we've never seen this happen before.

3750
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:30.501
What?

3751
01:37:30.501 --> 01:37:33.860
It can be guys foaming at the mouth and he's losing blood.

3752
01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:35.523
That's the,

3753
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.553
I've always,

3754
01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:39.080
always that fear.

3755
01:37:39.081 --> 01:37:40.100
So I don't do any of it.

3756
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:41.570
I just have a nice cabernet.

3757
01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.520
I would call it a night.

3758
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:44.120
Right?

3759
01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:44.953
That's my candy.

3760
01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:47.330
That's the end of that.

3761
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:48.051
<v 1>If you get crazy,</v>

3762
01:37:48.051 --> 01:37:49.160
you'll take a shot of Jack.

3763
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:50.330
I like,

3764
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.541
yeah,

3765
01:37:50.541 --> 01:37:51.140
like petroleum.

3766
01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:51.820
That's my pick.

3767
01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:53.930
Toronto Keela fairly smooth,

3768
01:37:53.931 --> 01:37:56.120
especially when it's cold and that's

3769
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.730
<v 0>all I got.</v>

3770
01:37:56.730 --> 01:37:57.750
But as far as I go,

3771
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:58.680
no coke,

3772
01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.070
no,

3773
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.580
never did it.

3774
01:37:59.580 --> 01:37:59.970
Never,

3775
01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:00.540
never,

3776
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:00.811
never.

3777
01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:02.620
And then let's talk about your fingernails thing.

3778
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:03.503
How'd you know that then?

3779
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.080
What do you mean?

3780
01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.100
I saw his fingernail.

3781
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:05.970
Mine's longer.

3782
01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:07.821
No coke.

3783
01:38:07.821 --> 01:38:08.654
No,

3784
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.230
no,

3785
01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:09.470
no.

3786
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:10.640
It's a little bit,

3787
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:11.500
must begin.

3788
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:12.321
Has a little bit long.

3789
01:38:12.321 --> 01:38:13.200
It could be a little longer.

3790
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:13.711
No,

3791
01:38:13.711 --> 01:38:14.090
I never did.

3792
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.923
I've never done it.

3793
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:16.351
I did.

3794
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:16.891
I did.

3795
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:17.724
Um,

3796
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.290
what did I do?

3797
01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:21.210
I did mushrooms once in college.

3798
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.710
Yeah.

3799
01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:23.940
And I don't know what was going on.

3800
01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:24.750
I had a,

3801
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.740
I had a full,

3802
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:28.440
I was freaking out and people had to talk me down.

3803
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:29.730
I don't know what was going on.

3804
01:38:29.731 --> 01:38:30.241
So I was like,

3805
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:30.630
this ain't,

3806
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:31.500
this ain't for me.

3807
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.453
You ate too much.

3808
01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:32.940
Yeah.

3809
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.301
Well I,

3810
01:38:33.301 --> 01:38:36.150
they gave me it in the sandwich and the guy,

3811
01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:38.160
apparently when you first do this stuff,

3812
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:39.930
you're supposed to do it with somebody.

3813
01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:44.310
And the guy left me and I was the president of my fraternity at the time.

3814
01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.680
So I'm walking around the house and the alumni has gone,

3815
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:48.030
what's going on with the,

3816
01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:49.201
with the chapter,

3817
01:38:49.201 --> 01:38:49.360
why,

3818
01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.161
why are we in debt?

3819
01:38:50.161 --> 01:38:50.881
And I'm like,

3820
01:38:50.881 --> 01:38:51.714
Eh,

3821
01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:52.943
sweating.

3822
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.110
And I had to go back to my room and in a in,

3823
01:38:56.111 --> 01:38:59.610
in by myself was in the room hoping that this kind of would end because I

3824
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:02.400
thought it was going to be this way for the rest of my life.

3825
01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:03.181
That's where it was.

3826
01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:03.780
So I was like,

3827
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:04.620
I ain't doing this,

3828
01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:04.741
this,

3829
01:39:04.741 --> 01:39:04.901
hey,

3830
01:39:04.901 --> 01:39:05.734
this ain't for me.

3831
01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.520
And ever since then,

3832
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:09.600
a little wine,

3833
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:10.680
Cabernet,

3834
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.670
Cabernet,

3835
01:39:11.671 --> 01:39:12.720
and we'll call it at night.

3836
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:13.621
I'll do,

3837
01:39:13.621 --> 01:39:14.700
I'll do a Jambo.

3838
01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:16.650
My wife may be on vacation.

3839
01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:19.350
We'll see how this can have a little bit of that.

3840
01:39:19.690 --> 01:39:20.020
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3841
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:20.321
no,

3842
01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:20.531
no,

3843
01:39:20.531 --> 01:39:20.711
no.

3844
01:39:20.711 --> 01:39:21.544
Don't listen to him.

3845
01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:24.970
This is a good measurement.

3846
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.460
Top of a USB stick or the,

3847
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:28.690
is that that metal piece?

3848
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:30.040
That's the standard.

3849
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:31.360
That's what you want.

3850
01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.380
That's what you want it.

3851
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:33.970
Nothing bigger than that.

3852
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:35.950
Look at that and chop that off.

3853
01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:36.701
Cut that off.

3854
01:39:36.701 --> 01:39:37.390
Cut that off.

3855
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:40.720
Cut that size of a piece off and then take a little time.

3856
01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:42.400
Like give it an hour and a half.

3857
01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.890
And then if you feel like I can go deeper,

3858
01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:47.140
then take a one and a half of those.

3859
01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:50.860
Just don't get crazy where people fuck up as they go too deep and then they

3860
01:39:50.861 --> 01:39:51.800
never want to do it again.

3861
01:39:51.801 --> 01:39:53.020
And they miss all the benefits.

3862
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:55.600
Girls that don't smoke weed usually have,

3863
01:39:55.630 --> 01:39:55.931
oh,

3864
01:39:55.931 --> 01:39:57.400
every time I smoke I have a panic attack.

3865
01:39:57.401 --> 01:39:59.170
How much do you smoke a joint?

3866
01:39:59.290 --> 01:39:59.591
And I'm like,

3867
01:39:59.591 --> 01:39:59.861
yeah,

3868
01:39:59.861 --> 01:40:00.760
why didn't you just have one?

3869
01:40:01.530 --> 01:40:04.510
If you don't smoke weed and you get into this sick California shit,

3870
01:40:04.511 --> 01:40:05.500
the genome is pushing.

3871
01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.790
Ooh,

3872
01:40:07.150 --> 01:40:08.290
but it's a psychedelic.

3873
01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.400
It really is.

3874
01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:10.293
I mean,

3875
01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:14.170
this new marijuana in the right dose is absolutely.

3876
01:40:14.171 --> 01:40:14.770
So I get dog,

3877
01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:15.730
especially if you eat it.

3878
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:19.830
I see some insane shit in my tank when I,

3879
01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:20.890
when I eat the weed,

3880
01:40:21.190 --> 01:40:21.761
I get a,

3881
01:40:21.761 --> 01:40:22.930
I got the wild,

3882
01:40:22.931 --> 01:40:25.840
wild visible visualizations or they might as well.

3883
01:40:25.841 --> 01:40:26.021
I mean,

3884
01:40:26.021 --> 01:40:27.250
it might as well be on mushrooms.

3885
01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:28.090
You know,

3886
01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:31.390
the combination of the sensory deprivation tank and then the weed together.

3887
01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:34.181
<v 0>No Yoga,</v>

3888
01:40:34.181 --> 01:40:34.661
Sebastian,

3889
01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:35.410
no nothing,

3890
01:40:35.410 --> 01:40:36.243
uh,

3891
01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:36.520
fit.

3892
01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.530
You look a fit guy and we're working out.

3893
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:39.460
I keep in shape,

3894
01:40:39.461 --> 01:40:40.840
but I'd like to get into yoga.

3895
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:41.830
The older I get,

3896
01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:44.230
the more I think I should get into yoga.

3897
01:40:44.231 --> 01:40:45.880
I have severe back problems.

3898
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:47.380
It'll help tremendously.

3899
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:48.340
I've heard the,

3900
01:40:48.341 --> 01:40:51.150
it's great for the back and a man on my posture.

3901
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:52.001
I'm slumping.

3902
01:40:52.001 --> 01:40:52.820
I feel like I'm,

3903
01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.070
I'm devolving.

3904
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.821
<v 1>I live in the city.</v>

3905
01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:55.270
Where do you live?

3906
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:56.500
I live West Hollywood area.

3907
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:56.711
Yeah.

3908
01:40:56.711 --> 01:40:57.330
There's a great,

3909
01:40:57.330 --> 01:40:57.500
uh,

3910
01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.360
that beak rooms,

3911
01:40:58.361 --> 01:40:59.500
yoga en Los [inaudible].

3912
01:40:59.501 --> 01:41:00.460
That's the beak room.

3913
01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:02.190
That crazy fucker who's,

3914
01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:02.770
um,

3915
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:03.580
the like,

3916
01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:07.150
he's always been charged with sexual assault and all kinds of weird shit.

3917
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.710
I don't know what the fuck the guy did or didn't do,

3918
01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.890
but highly regarded as a yoga instructor.

3919
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:14.740
It's supposed to be kind of a kind of douchey human.

3920
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:16.200
That's the heat.

3921
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:16.510
The,

3922
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:17.230
yeah.

3923
01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:17.710
Yoga.

3924
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:18.160
Yeah.

3925
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:18.993
That's what I do.

3926
01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.013
I do that stuff.

3927
01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:20.471
You know,

3928
01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:23.050
one of the reasons why I do it is because I'm Rhonda Patrick,

3929
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:25.030
the doctor that I had in the podcast a bunch of times,

3930
01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:26.081
she talks about,

3931
01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:26.914
uh,

3932
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.500
the benefits of Sauna about a heat shock,

3933
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.750
like heat shock proteins and a,

3934
01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:33.730
when your body heats up like that,

3935
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:34.211
there's like,

3936
01:41:34.211 --> 01:41:36.820
there's this compensatory response that you're a,

3937
01:41:36.821 --> 01:41:37.031
you know,

3938
01:41:37.031 --> 01:41:37.511
your body's like,

3939
01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:37.991
Holy Shit,

3940
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:38.820
we're dying.

3941
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:42.820
Like we have to produce like something to deal with this and that,

3942
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.200
that response,

3943
01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:47.680
I guarantee you that's a similar thing to what you get when you do hot yoga.

3944
01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:48.760
Because when I do that shit,

3945
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:50.320
I'm high for like the rest of the day.

3946
01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:51.880
It sucks why you're doing it,

3947
01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:52.420
man.

3948
01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:55.930
Whatever bitch you have in you that fucking last 15,

3949
01:41:55.931 --> 01:41:57.190
20 minutes a yoga class,

3950
01:41:57.191 --> 01:41:59.140
we'll pull it out because those,

3951
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:02.410
that's the hardest one of the hardest things I do is the law.

3952
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.690
Like it's an hour and a half class the last 15,

3953
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:07.810
20 minutes I am fucking sweating like a pig.

3954
01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.810
He overheating like crazy.

3955
01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:11.861
But when you get out of there,

3956
01:42:11.861 --> 01:42:14.440
you feel like you're really did something and you feel great.

3957
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:16.630
You feel like loose and pliable?

3958
01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:17.411
I need that.

3959
01:42:17.411 --> 01:42:19.390
I need to apply a bit tight.

3960
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:20.343
And uh,

3961
01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:21.820
especially as you get older,

3962
01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.380
it just smell like button there though.

3963
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.570
Is it just some butts everywhere and cause mass?

3964
01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.813
I try to not,

3965
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:27.910
that's tricky to myself.

3966
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:31.300
Stick my nose and people's asses.

3967
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:33.070
It's mostly smells like housewives.

3968
01:42:33.071 --> 01:42:35.680
Mostly housewives or tougher than you think dude.

3969
01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:36.461
But Oh,

3970
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:37.294
there's some pretty girls.

3971
01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:38.440
Pretty girls do yoga.

3972
01:42:38.650 --> 01:42:39.760
That's one of the benefits of it.

3973
01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.170
They get something to look at.

3974
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:44.320
I got to get down to more alternative type of,

3975
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:44.801
I mean,

3976
01:42:44.801 --> 01:42:45.011
you know,

3977
01:42:45.011 --> 01:42:45.410
I'm still,

3978
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.611
you know,

3979
01:42:45.611 --> 01:42:47.620
going to the gym on the weights,

3980
01:42:47.710 --> 01:42:48.251
stretching.

3981
01:42:48.251 --> 01:42:50.230
So it was so important that I'll do that.

3982
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.700
Told,

3983
01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.070
you know,

3984
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:52.300
42 yeah,

3985
01:42:52.301 --> 01:42:53.230
see as you get older,

3986
01:42:53.231 --> 01:42:56.260
that is the one thing that really fucks with you is flexibility.

3987
01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.480
Spinal flexibility is a big one.

3988
01:42:58.780 --> 01:42:59.613
Mobility,

3989
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:00.431
you know,

3990
01:43:00.431 --> 01:43:01.091
and a lot of people,

3991
01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:02.080
they don't work on that.

3992
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:03.340
It's not fun.

3993
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:06.740
It's fun to go and do some curls and then look at yourself in a mayor.

3994
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:08.110
You know,

3995
01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:08.920
that's fun.

3996
01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.753
It's easy,

3997
01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:11.500
but it's not easy doing yoga.

3998
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:12.363
Would you do yoga?

3999
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.720
Yeah.

4000
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.920
I think if I went into hot yoga though,

4001
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.773
why not?

4002
01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:18.940
I just don't like it.

4003
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:23.860
I did hot yoga once with my ex like long time ago and it was awful.

4004
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:24.703
It was just miserable.

4005
01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:25.030
I didn't,

4006
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.151
yeah,

4007
01:43:25.151 --> 01:43:25.830
that's a point.

4008
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:26.663
Yeah.

4009
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:27.371
You must have to,

4010
01:43:27.371 --> 01:43:28.204
supposed to be fun.

4011
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.340
I think it would be fine,

4012
01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:30.670
but,

4013
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:31.300
uh,

4014
01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.140
I don't know what he thought about doing it.

4015
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.860
I mean,

4016
01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:34.693
don't do it,

4017
01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:37.871
but if you,

4018
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:38.380
like,

4019
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:39.041
if I,

4020
01:43:39.041 --> 01:43:40.090
in an ideal world,

4021
01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:41.920
if you could step outside yourself,

4022
01:43:41.921 --> 01:43:44.320
if you were like giving yourself advice and you were like,

4023
01:43:44.321 --> 01:43:44.680
you know,

4024
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.460
Brian Red Van,

4025
01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:46.600
you need to get your shit together,

4026
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:47.733
I'm going to help you.

4027
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:48.460
And uh,

4028
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:49.810
this is what I'm prescribed.

4029
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:51.410
What would you prescribe that you do

4030
01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:52.853
<v 2>from la?</v>

4031
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:55.220
Why would you move from la?

4032
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.270
Uh,

4033
01:43:56.370 --> 01:43:56.750
just,

4034
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:57.620
it's hard living here.

4035
01:43:57.621 --> 01:43:59.760
It's very stressful to live here in Norway.

4036
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:00.950
Uh,

4037
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:02.330
moneywise and stuff like that.

4038
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:04.250
Paying bills and know.

4039
01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.020
But you are responsible.

4040
01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:07.790
I'm hard of super irresponsible.

4041
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:11.360
Don't pay your taxes every penny you have all the money.

4042
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:12.050
Yeah.

4043
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:15.110
There's a lot of issues with you that have nothing to do with the cost of living

4044
01:44:15.111 --> 01:44:15.944
in Burbank,

4045
01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.010
having like death squads studio and all that.

4046
01:44:18.011 --> 01:44:18.440
That's like,

4047
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.780
that's like $2,000 a month that I'm just fucking,

4048
01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:23.990
how much rent insurance,

4049
01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:24.710
uh,

4050
01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:25.610
Internet,

4051
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:27.170
all the crap that goes with it.

4052
01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.150
Why don't you have ads on your podcasts?

4053
01:44:29.151 --> 01:44:30.110
Like what is wrong with you?

4054
01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:32.390
That seems so silly.

4055
01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:33.560
That would fix all that.

4056
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:34.370
Like that.

4057
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:35.203
Yeah,

4058
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:37.101
exactly.

4059
01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:37.311
It's,

4060
01:44:37.311 --> 01:44:37.700
yeah.

4061
01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:38.630
I don't have a staff.

4062
01:44:38.631 --> 01:44:39.380
I have nobody.

4063
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:40.530
I just staffed again,

4064
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.750
a staff to,

4065
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:45.180
to work out deals and to make sure things happen and things like that.

4066
01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:45.600
You don't,

4067
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.433
you get an agent.

4068
01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:47.810
I know.

4069
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:48.790
I have agents now.

4070
01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.120
I know I have none of that though.

4071
01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:50.480
So,

4072
01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.470
but that's easy to get.

4073
01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.090
Like this podcast agents,

4074
01:44:53.091 --> 01:44:56.270
if you have like a certain amount of downloads per month,

4075
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:58.760
there's people that have less downloads than you that get agents.

4076
01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.150
Yeah.

4077
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:00.110
Well I'm sure it's easy.

4078
01:45:00.111 --> 01:45:01.820
It's just that right now it's just like,

4079
01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.120
ah,

4080
01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.530
so much stress with other things,

4081
01:45:03.531 --> 01:45:03.750
you know,

4082
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:04.280
going on.

4083
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.260
So got to take care of your fucking house.

4084
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.220
Keep your house in order,

4085
01:45:07.221 --> 01:45:08.054
son.

4086
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:09.103
You hate what?

4087
01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.200
I hate all discipline.

4088
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:10.590
No.

4089
01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:10.820
Yeah,

4090
01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:13.040
I hate all this work.

4091
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.521
It's like,

4092
01:45:13.521 --> 01:45:14.720
it's like I want to be creative.

4093
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:18.590
I don't want to be like filing papers and like getting,

4094
01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:18.861
you know,

4095
01:45:18.861 --> 01:45:19.880
doing all this crap.

4096
01:45:19.881 --> 01:45:22.250
This guy was a fucking waitress.

4097
01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:23.711
Nicholas.

4098
01:45:23.711 --> 01:45:24.544
Okay.

4099
01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:27.080
You know how nice in a fight.

4100
01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:28.040
I used to do the same thing.

4101
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:28.720
I waited.

4102
01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.960
Why don't you do it in 11 years?

4103
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:31.270
It's a well known.

4104
01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:34.640
It's like whether it's saying it's actually relaxing that having,

4105
01:45:34.641 --> 01:45:38.630
that's very fun because you sleep with everyone that works at the restaurant,

4106
01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:42.770
you know when your weight or you just pretty much hang out with that.

4107
01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:43.521
Those people,

4108
01:45:43.521 --> 01:45:44.690
it's like having a different fan,

4109
01:45:44.691 --> 01:45:45.570
like a comedy family.

4110
01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:46.413
Like you said,

4111
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:47.600
I've done that for awhile,

4112
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:48.380
but uh,

4113
01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:49.280
that's a different life though.

4114
01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:50.150
It's basic.

4115
01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:50.984
It's nice.

4116
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:52.370
That's a nice basic life.

4117
01:45:52.371 --> 01:45:55.460
Instead of having to deal with all this crap that,

4118
01:45:55.461 --> 01:45:57.470
don't get me wrong,

4119
01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:58.670
I don't think there's anything wrong.

4120
01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.760
Getting a job supplementing your income long.

4121
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.911
Right.

4122
01:46:00.911 --> 01:46:01.820
Being creative.

4123
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:02.241
Right.

4124
01:46:02.241 --> 01:46:02.991
For for,

4125
01:46:02.991 --> 01:46:03.480
for me,

4126
01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.940
it allowed me to do a lot of things that I probably couldn't if I was just

4127
01:46:07.941 --> 01:46:09.200
relying on comedy,

4128
01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.610
comedy income.

4129
01:46:10.611 --> 01:46:11.270
Sure.

4130
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:12.380
Oh absolutely.

4131
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.821
Yeah.

4132
01:46:12.821 --> 01:46:15.020
I mean it's the fucking grind,

4133
01:46:15.021 --> 01:46:15.470
man.

4134
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:16.101
It's a grind.

4135
01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:17.540
The early days especially,

4136
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:19.180
I used to deliver newspapers.

4137
01:46:19.181 --> 01:46:20.014
I was my gig.

4138
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.750
Oh yeah,

4139
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:21.170
yeah.

4140
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:22.160
Get up every morning.

4141
01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.330
That's when I lived in Boston.

4142
01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.350
The problem data is you can't go on the road because you can't leave cause you

4143
01:46:27.351 --> 01:46:28.310
have to do wrote.

4144
01:46:28.590 --> 01:46:29.423
Yeah.

4145
01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:33.380
If there's a lot of different fucking gigs that you can get as a struggling

4146
01:46:33.381 --> 01:46:34.460
comedian in la,

4147
01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:35.443
you know,

4148
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:36.651
especially in the home.

4149
01:46:36.651 --> 01:46:39.260
I mean there's a lot of opportunities out there for,

4150
01:46:39.261 --> 01:46:39.471
I mean,

4151
01:46:39.471 --> 01:46:40.030
if Uber,

4152
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:42.620
I think Uber was around when I was coming up,

4153
01:46:42.650 --> 01:46:45.950
I definitely would have been an Uber driver and I would have kept my car

4154
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:48.080
unbelievably clean.

4155
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.040
I always used

4156
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.930
<v 0>to take pride in the corner of my car.</v>

4157
01:46:51.931 --> 01:46:53.530
Just the way it smelled.

4158
01:46:53.531 --> 01:46:54.570
The vacuuming.

4159
01:46:54.571 --> 01:46:55.404
Nice.

4160
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:56.971
Oh yeah.

4161
01:46:56.971 --> 01:46:58.030
I constantly do it.

4162
01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.670
Everything is clean.

4163
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:01.163
You're clean guy.

4164
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.610
I like being clean.

4165
01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.473
I like that about,

4166
01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:04.591
I dunno,

4167
01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:07.890
I just grew up in this house where you know every last,

4168
01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.120
no,

4169
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:09.450
no,

4170
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:09.690
no,

4171
01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:10.440
we weren't that.

4172
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.010
Uh,

4173
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:11.371
no.

4174
01:47:11.371 --> 01:47:11.791
I'm telling you,

4175
01:47:11.791 --> 01:47:12.990
I have uncles and aunts.

4176
01:47:12.991 --> 01:47:14.760
They lived in the basement with the plastic,

4177
01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:15.481
not my house,

4178
01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:16.051
my house.

4179
01:47:16.051 --> 01:47:17.820
You could go wherever you wanted to go,

4180
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.780
but it was clean.

4181
01:47:18.781 --> 01:47:19.770
How did that ever happen?

4182
01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:21.050
The plastic on the furniture in it.

4183
01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.140
And you don't use,

4184
01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:23.730
you don't use it.

4185
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.380
It's,

4186
01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:27.330
they got kitchens that they don't use upstairs.

4187
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.500
It's a showpiece.

4188
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.951
Yeah.

4189
01:47:28.951 --> 01:47:29.411
What does that,

4190
01:47:29.411 --> 01:47:29.940
I dunno.

4191
01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:30.540
I Dunno.

4192
01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:31.230
I think that's,

4193
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:31.741
I don't know.

4194
01:47:31.741 --> 01:47:32.970
Because you go to Italy,

4195
01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.530
they ain't living in the basement.

4196
01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:36.030
They're using whatever they got.

4197
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:39.030
Apparently they came here and now there's two kitchens.

4198
01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:41.280
There's one upstairs and there's one downstairs.

4199
01:47:41.281 --> 01:47:42.750
I had an aunt that you walk in,

4200
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.760
you didn't even go up there like a rope.

4201
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:47.560
You couldn't even go into that kitchen upstairs.

4202
01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.840
Rope rope.

4203
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:49.890
Like,

4204
01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:51.150
like a line at a club?

4205
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:51.421
Yeah.

4206
01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:51.611
Like,

4207
01:47:51.611 --> 01:47:51.870
uh,

4208
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:54.960
like almost like a velvet rope that they hook that you couldn't even get into

4209
01:47:54.961 --> 01:47:55.794
that area.

4210
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.250
You went right downstairs and then they lived right in the basement.

4211
01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.030
Wow.

4212
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:01.110
So I dunno.

4213
01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:01.921
I Dunno what it was,

4214
01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:02.820
but it was strange.

4215
01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:04.080
It was strange.

4216
01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:04.210
And,

4217
01:48:04.210 --> 01:48:04.361
and,

4218
01:48:04.361 --> 01:48:05.760
and the whole thing with the uncle,

4219
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:07.740
my uncle really taught me how to be clean.

4220
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:11.370
That was the whole thing was he always kept his car immaculate and I was

4221
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:12.430
fascinated by it.

4222
01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.120
Just fat kind of car.

4223
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.310
You drove a Cadillac and how he was,

4224
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.790
how we used to um,

4225
01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.560
make it smell good was he used to take like a little towel,

4226
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:25.950
cut it into squares and then roll up the little squares,

4227
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:29.160
put them in Cologne and let that marinate over night.

4228
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:33.660
Then in the morning,

4229
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.593
then

4230
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:42.960
he took it and they put it in the events of the car underneath.

4231
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:43.291
Right.

4232
01:48:43.291 --> 01:48:47.480
And then when he put the air or the heat on TrueCar throughout the,

4233
01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.000
so nasty.

4234
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.490
This is crazy.

4235
01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:54.290
This is 80.

4236
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:55.830
That's hilarious.

4237
01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:57.390
That's so fucking funny.

4238
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:59.040
So I was just to be fascinated.

4239
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:00.220
I know you used to keep things,

4240
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:01.830
everything was very meticulous.

4241
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:02.880
So I didn't,

4242
01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.370
to this day I kinda like to keep my car clean.

4243
01:49:05.371 --> 01:49:06.121
Everybody does.

4244
01:49:06.121 --> 01:49:06.901
Come on don't you?

4245
01:49:06.901 --> 01:49:07.950
I mean they see you pull up in the,

4246
01:49:07.951 --> 01:49:08.191
in the,

4247
01:49:08.191 --> 01:49:09.600
in that you got a nice clean car.

4248
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:10.740
<v 1>Phil Shit.</v>

4249
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:13.230
Some of my cars are clean.

4250
01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:14.530
The Bay,

4251
01:49:14.530 --> 01:49:17.070
the Corvettes always clean the um,

4252
01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:17.401
the,

4253
01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:17.660
you,

4254
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.580
your uncle was ahead of its time because the,

4255
01:49:19.581 --> 01:49:22.080
they have new cars now that actually have that as an option.

4256
01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:24.450
They have like a scent that you can plug in.

4257
01:49:24.451 --> 01:49:29.451
Like the new BMW seven series has several different sense and you turn them on

4258
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:33.010
and they slowly like filter into the cars.

4259
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.630
Yeah.

4260
01:49:33.630 --> 01:49:37.350
I have like a woodsy scents but meanwhile how much cancer you getting from that

4261
01:49:37.351 --> 01:49:38.184
stuff?

4262
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.360
Brazen in some fucking fake smell that they've pumped into your,

4263
01:49:41.690 --> 01:49:42.361
your lungs.

4264
01:49:42.361 --> 01:49:44.280
If you could smell it in your inhaling it,

4265
01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:45.710
that's a whatever it is.

4266
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.860
It is a great idea.

4267
01:49:46.861 --> 01:49:47.980
As long as it doesn't kill you.

4268
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.970
It's a great idea.

4269
01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.840
It's probably just the same stuff that they spray and like the car wash when you

4270
01:49:51.841 --> 01:49:53.200
went new car cherry.

4271
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.741
Yeah,

4272
01:49:53.741 --> 01:49:54.071
maybe.

4273
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:58.030
But the problem is it's going through the vents and so like it's in the air.

4274
01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:02.380
I would like to have a particle analysis of what the stuff is actually doing.

4275
01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:03.910
I liked the smell of leather.

4276
01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.710
I like the smell of a new car.

4277
01:50:05.711 --> 01:50:06.810
Like the new leather smell.

4278
01:50:06.811 --> 01:50:08.650
I don't need like Forrest smells.

4279
01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:11.890
I don't know Unicorn farts.

4280
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:12.783
I don't need that.

4281
01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.860
And you know Daisy's,

4282
01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:15.580
it smells like days.

4283
01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:17.050
What am I outside or a man side?

4284
01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:17.591
I'm in the car.

4285
01:50:17.591 --> 01:50:18.330
Right?

4286
01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:19.240
You want to smell Daisy's?

4287
01:50:19.241 --> 01:50:20.950
I'll go sit in a daisy field.

4288
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:22.300
Daisy's even smell.

4289
01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:23.420
It might just make it easier.

4290
01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:24.400
Do they smell good?

4291
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:26.083
What does

4292
01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:29.493
anyway,

4293
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:30.700
anything else to add?

4294
01:50:30.701 --> 01:50:32.620
So Basha anything else to add?

4295
01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:33.370
Um,

4296
01:50:33.370 --> 01:50:33.581
no.

4297
01:50:33.581 --> 01:50:35.890
I don't know anybody that died from smelling dirt.

4298
01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.770
Car sounds so gross though.

4299
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:41.080
I bet there's a lot of rape victims that would

4300
01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:44.380
argue against that.

4301
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:46.240
I heard that stuff for a while.

4302
01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:46.930
Again.

4303
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:47.111
Why?

4304
01:50:47.111 --> 01:50:47.861
Why did I have it?

4305
01:50:47.861 --> 01:50:48.760
Cause I was trying to get laid.

4306
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:49.570
That's why.

4307
01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:50.950
So you no longer work alone?

4308
01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:51.843
No.

4309
01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.170
How dare you do?

4310
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:55.000
What did you were you were at your car?

4311
01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:55.300
Look,

4312
01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:55.560
not,

4313
01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.050
no,

4314
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:57.430
I'm a fucking man.

4315
01:50:57.850 --> 01:50:58.680
I swear.

4316
01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.190
I smell like a man like a man.

4317
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:02.480
So she'll Cologne is,

4318
01:51:02.481 --> 01:51:03.490
is not manly.

4319
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:05.320
Nope.

4320
01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:05.950
Nope.

4321
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:06.310
No.

4322
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.580
I know.

4323
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.450
It's like perfume.

4324
01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:08.320
It's guy perfume.

4325
01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.460
It's just a little,

4326
01:51:09.461 --> 01:51:10.690
just a little hint.

4327
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:11.913
Hmm.

4328
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:12.940
I have often,

4329
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:14.320
I have often heard this,

4330
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:15.263
you know,

4331
01:51:15.450 --> 01:51:19.510
they're not going to like this bull Cologne and your hand,

4332
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:20.403
right.

4333
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:23.170
Shake somebody's hands like your business card and they go home.

4334
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:25.123
Is that him?

4335
01:51:25.730 --> 01:51:27.570
Is that her right on that.

4336
01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:29.930
That's disgusting.

4337

I heard that.

4338
01:51:30.831 --> 01:51:32.580
Somebody told me Polo Colona and enhance.

4339
01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.573
They're an asshole.

4340
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:37.040
That person's fucking crazy.

4341
01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:38.660
You don't want to do that.

4342
01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.301

4348
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.770
That's how Holly Mandela got started with knuckles.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:56.480
Somebody snuck on my sub Sebastian [inaudible] business card.
