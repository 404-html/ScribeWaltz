00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I live with the fact that there's some people that,</v>

4

<v Speaker 1>of what I do.</v>

6

<v Speaker 1>And then there are some people like,</v>

7
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking baffled.</v>

12
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.800

13
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:16.221
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

14
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:16.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll take love it or leave it because that's a perfect example.</v>

16
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>What you just use those a great example.</v>

17
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>What's special about this whole thing is that a guy like you,</v>

31
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Do it written,</v>

32

<v Speaker 1>Fuck the entire system of it.</v>

34
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>A guy like you really wouldn't exist any other way.</v>

35
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

36
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.703
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.501
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

38
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.101
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go.</v>

39
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>You're the ultimate love it or leave your,</v>

40
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it your way.</v>

41
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Play it with passion.</v>

42
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Here's my philosophy and how does everybody's philosophy?</v>

43
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not even an original one.</v>

44
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.991
<v Speaker 1>One life.</v>

45
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You fucking die.</v>

46
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

47
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know what's on the other side.</v>

48
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And we hope for this,</v>

49
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>that we hope for Candyland.</v>

50
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:10.841
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

52
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>It could be as simple as getting a box and stay there for all the fucking</v>

53
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:14.531
<v Speaker 1>attorney you had.</v>

54
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.041
<v Speaker 1>Your shot,</v>

55
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:15.701
<v Speaker 1>your computer,</v>

56
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>we shut you down and you're finished.</v>

57
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>

58
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.063
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

59
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>it behooves you to shoot for your dreams every time.</v>

60
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds a little dopey and Tony Robbins this,</v>

61
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>

62
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.811
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

63
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Like in a world where you're going to fucking die.</v>

64
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the way I think about it and that it's an example that's a real</v>

65
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:36.371
<v Speaker 1>close to home.</v>

66
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>My old man was a good dude,</v>

67
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.411
<v Speaker 1>my father,</v>

68
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>good guy.</v>

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Not many good men in the world.</v>

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>This was a good fucking guy did worked at a post office cancel and you're</v>

71
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:47.200

<v Speaker 1>horrible job that is for years just to pay for a fucking family.</v>

74
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Who knew if he had dreams.</v>

75
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe his only dream was to like,</v>

76
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

77

78
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wasn't a big deal to him.</v>

79
00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And he did whatever he had to put food on the table and stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hadn't been that way in years.</v>

107
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.461
<v Speaker 1>My Mom,</v>

108
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.294

117
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make the trip that time.</v>

118
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

128
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>parents love seeing their kids all in one place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you could hear it in his voice.</v>

174
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:13.271
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:17.350

<v Speaker 1>got dressed,</v>

180
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:18.754
<v Speaker 1>went down.</v>

181
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I've get to the emergency room,</v>

182
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>open the door.</v>

183
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 1>First thing I see is my mother who looks more scared than I've ever seen,</v>

184
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>a human being in my life.</v>

185
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Fucking terror on her face.</v>

186
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:30.814
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

187
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I've seen my mother cry in my lifetime.</v>

188
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:33.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

189
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I've made my mother cry in my lifetime.</v>

190
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I've watched her cry watching fucking Falcon Crest when I was a kid.</v>

191
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>This was different.</v>

192
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>This was like terror,</v>

193
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.153
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

194
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

195
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>almost like there was a fucking gun to her head and off of her face.</v>

197
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I looked in my brother and my brother just has this expression where you just</v>

198
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>kind of gives me the slow nod,</v>

199
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.324
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

200
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>he's gone,</v>

201
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>my father was dead and I went in and I saw him on a Gurney and shit,</v>

203
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and it was so strange.</v>

204
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And I go outside and I was a smoker,</v>

205
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>like cigarette smoke room.</v>

206
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Those days I was going to have a cigarette and,</v>

207
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Donald comes out and I was like,</v>

209
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

210
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

211
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>this is a shock and whatever,</v>

213
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:08.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>we're upset and stuff.</v>

215
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.051
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

216
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:11.471
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

217
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>how was it because he was there.</v>

218
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:13.451
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

219
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.051
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

220
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>And Donald tells me the story of like,</v>

221
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>a dad woke up and had this like big reaction,</v>

222
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:19.931
<v Speaker 1>like just like,</v>

223
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm hot,</v>

224
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm hot under his,</v>

225
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 1>thrown the sheets off and mom freak touches.</v>

226
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.471
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

227
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:23.951
<v Speaker 1>what's the matter?</v>

228
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:24.371
<v Speaker 1>What's the matter?</v>

229
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>She told Donald Call,</v>

230
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd call the ambulance,</v>

231
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.974
<v Speaker 1>call the hospital,</v>

232
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>and he was gone within seconds.</v>

233
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>

234
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 1>bad enough,</v>

236
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>he was hot and uncomfortable.</v>

238
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hear like,</v>

239
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.411
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

240
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>he died in his sleep and we woke up and he just didn't.</v>

241
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>But then my brother says,</v>

242
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>this thing probably defined my life.</v>

243
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>My brother goes,</v>

244
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:42.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

245
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>he died screaming and I go,</v>

246
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.521
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

247
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

248
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.681
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

249
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

250
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>he died screaming.</v>

251
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:49.631
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

252
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>w I mean as,</v>

253
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>is that a figure of speech?</v>

254
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

255
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.261
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

256
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:53.891
<v Speaker 1>he literally,</v>

257
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>he died screaming.</v>

258
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.910
<v Speaker 1>And you could see my brother was haunted by it and my father wasn't like a,</v>

259
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say he was a butch man or strong man,</v>

260
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't the soft men money stretch to the imagination.</v>

261
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>And I never heard him get real loud or anything like that.</v>

262
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>And the notion of my father dying,</v>

263
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>screaming changed my life because I was like,</v>

264
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>even a good man in this world.</v>

265
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>You play the game,</v>

266
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you play it straight,</v>

267
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you play by the rules,</v>

268
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you do everything you're supposed to,</v>

269
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die screaming.</v>

270
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>And at that point I was like,</v>

271
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.621
<v Speaker 1>there's no point in not trying to accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've</v>

272
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

273
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's dumb shit,</v>

274
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:29.601
<v Speaker 1>like fucking,</v>

275
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:29.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:30.704
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

277
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to collect this money.</v>

278
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a Wayne Gretzky cards in one fucking binder.</v>

279
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Or if it's like I want to make a movie or if it's like I want to put on podcasts</v>

280
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>or I want to do a TV show now I want to write a book,</v>

281
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 1>chase it all down.</v>

282
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Chasing whimsy is what I've been doing for the last few years,</v>

283
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:44.781
<v Speaker 1>just smoking weed.</v>

284
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And chances went whimsies anytime I'm like back in the day,</v>

285
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.734
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a good idea,</v>

286
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>something I really wanted to follow through on it.</v>

287
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:50.871
<v Speaker 1>And they'll say,</v>

288
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.591
<v Speaker 1>you can get scared.</v>

289
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You start thinking about some about some of the fucker's gonna say and be like,</v>

292
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:56.630
