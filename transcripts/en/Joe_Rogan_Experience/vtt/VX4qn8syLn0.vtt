<v Speaker 1>like if you don't know.</v>

13
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird accident.</v>

14
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

15
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe Rogan.</v>

16
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I love your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jail.</v>

17
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking weird.</v>

18
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>It's and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like hardcore.</v>

19
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>They say shit like for sync.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say zinc kitchen.</v>

20
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambulance.</v>

21
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Think I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I had a southern accent</v>

22
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>until I moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I still don't believe I have a</v>

23
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>southern accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a draw.</v>

24
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a draw is a southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

25
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>But overall it's a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Alabama,</v>

26
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Mississippi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

27
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a friendly southern accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>

28
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.771
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

29
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk to this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

30
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

31
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those.</v>

32
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>People are always surprised when I say</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland.</v>

33
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>But when you get into pockets of like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>

34
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>they've got a southern accent there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when you go into like Indiana,</v>

35
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>there are certain areas of Indiana that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a southern accent and other places</v>

36
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>that don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird about these little</v>

37
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>settlements and they've just developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>these accents that just stay there.</v>

38
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I think Baltimore is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood though.</v>

39
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird one because it's a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

40
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean Baltimore is a big city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call it the big little city.</v>

41
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>How many people in Baltimore?</v>

42
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>If I had a guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple million,</v>

43
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a big city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than San Diego.</v>

45
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's gotten older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got history.</v>

47
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of history.</v>

48
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But that weird ass accent that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know anybody from Baltimore,</v>

49
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't know that accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my buddy owns a junk yard in the</v>

50
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>city and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took Jay back when we were on tour as</v>

51
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you've got to come meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this junk yard and shit and you</v>

52
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people drop.</v>

53
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:09.571
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

54
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>we're doing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

55
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>just put a k on the end of that right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

56
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't know any pick you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing over there.</v>

58
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And he's also for for years I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC,</v>

59
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Washer and dryer because everyone there</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says it right?</v>

60
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And one day somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

61
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

62
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>put it in the Washer and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spell washer,</v>

63
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>w a s h e r like there's no r in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

64
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started saying to myself,</v>

65
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

66
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I do fucking say Washington and Washer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I trained myself to get out of that.</v>

67
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>But anytime I see something political on</v>
<v Speaker 1>tv,</v>

68
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>if I hear someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in Washington,</v>

69
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.201
<v Speaker 1>then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

70
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you're in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're from that area.</v>

71
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>The same way with the days of the week.</v>

00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>to announcers like Phil Sims.</v>

74
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they were working out on Monday and</v>

75
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:02.981

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Well I grew up in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an obvious accent.</v>

79
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have it.</v>

80
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

81
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.661
<v Speaker 1>so you did have shook it loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you hear me from like tooth that</v>

82
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>early before pre 2000 I had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.161
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

84
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I heard it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it in my own.</v>

85
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like iu and then they got rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

86
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>First Time I heard I was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this thing and I was on local</v>

87
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>television at 19 and I heard my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my accent.</v>

00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is that sound coming</v>

89
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>out of my mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to correct that.</v>

90
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever slip into it from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered?</v>

91
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>If I'm hammered and I'm around Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

92
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.890

<v Speaker 1>but just to touch,</v>

93
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>just to touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it would be fake.</v>

131
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you be?</v>

132
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>In a perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably have a house right on the</v>

133
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:31.730
<v Speaker 1>white river in Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A salt water.</v>

134
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd have four wheelers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd throw some traps out in the water on</v>

135
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

136
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>crab traps and buy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the.</v>

137
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>This is how you say the day Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by Saturday,</v>

138
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Saturday we'll have a fucking crab</v>

139
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>feast on God damn right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence the podcasts,</v>

140
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 1>and every week I would have my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just throw them out there because</v>

141
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing I really miss about</v>

142
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>merit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Sushi out here</v>

143
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.160
<v Speaker 2>is phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the seafood,</v>

144
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 2>there's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could go,</v>

145
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 2>we could go to a dive bar right now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a plate,</v>

146
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>a bucket of rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little pony rolling rocks and a</v>

147
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>plate of Mussels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marinara that will blow any fucking</v>

148
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>restaurant out here out in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a dive blues bar.</v>

149
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I miss the readiness of an availability</v>
<v Speaker 2>of delicious seafood</v>

150
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.430
<v Speaker 3>everywhere I go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

151
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of really good seafood</v>

152
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 3>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just Sushi out here.</v>

153
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real good point.</v>

154
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like what do you get out here for</v>
<v Speaker 3>seafood?</v>

155
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Like some will have salmon on the menu</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe this like haddock or something</v>

156
00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or halibut or you don't know.</v>

157
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.770
<v Speaker 3>There's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like back home in Boston it was legal.</v>

158
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Seafoods was a joint 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people went to a seafood</v>

159
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:43.624
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

160
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Seafood restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Popular out here.</v>

161
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.500
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

162
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:51.180
<v Speaker 3>And we're on the water and then we're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>coastal fucking like,</v>

163
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 3>why aren't we embrace if there's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean right there embracing that.</v>

164
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to that ocean,</v>

165
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:58.360
<v Speaker 3>it's hardly anybody fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

166
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like California,</v>

167
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:01.444
<v Speaker 3>like go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the,</v>

168

<v Speaker 3>You might see one or two.</v>

170
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I just looked up best bass fishing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in California because my brother</v>

<v Speaker 2>water is brackish,</v>

172
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's not enough to keep crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

173
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.470
<v Speaker 2>but he's pulling out large mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending me pictures.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they say mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good because I got to get up there and</v>

178
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:37.650

<v Speaker 2>But pyramid they said I feel like</v>

179
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I feel like pyramid dried up a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

180
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.421
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

183
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.670
<v Speaker 3>to hone ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful lake.</v>

184
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Pyramid is like one of them lost lakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know about,</v>

185
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.040
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would live there on the water and uh,</v>

186
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I miss my dad was an outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to you about this at the</v>

187
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 2>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad hunted and stuff but fished,</v>

188
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really got us into crab and,</v>

189
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 2>and not just throwing traps in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

190
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Speaker 2>We used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a trotline we used to run a</v>

191
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:08.370
<v Speaker 2>trotline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

192
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:10.740
<v Speaker 2>if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father died when I was 16.</v>

193
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had 24 hours,</v>

194
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 2>if my dad could come back here right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 24 hours,</v>

195
00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 2>what would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we be up on the water crabbing at</v>

196
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.690

<v Speaker 2>Sun Up.</v>

197
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.310
<v Speaker 2>That's right when you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start dipping.</v>

198
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 2>And then home by 11 and then steam them</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

199
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 2>have a big ass fucking crab feast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably Watch a game.</v>

<v Speaker 2>here when you die.</v>

202
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.450
<v Speaker 2>And then play catch into the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be what I would do.</v>

203
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.910
<v Speaker 2>But we had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>late mid to late eighties were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

234
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the butcher and get bullets.</v>

235
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You know the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

236
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the discarded lips of bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual bullets.</v>

237
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to be your bait because</v>
<v Speaker 1>crabs are the biggest scavengers you</v>

238
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>could use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken necks are popular.</v>

239
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>That's an easy one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go to the grocery store,</v>

240
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to go to a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>butcher to get bullets.</v>

241
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got those grocery stores.</v>

242
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Is it more effective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just stank and nasty and like using</v>

243
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 1>chicken liver for catfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

244
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>But also it's durable because these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are eating it.</v>

245
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be your line for most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the summer.</v>

246
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have to replace one or two,</v>

247
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's adorable bait that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>withstand the crabs.</v>

248
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Tearing it up for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really three months.</v>

249
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going out over the summer,</v>

250
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you go crabbing 10 times</v>

251
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 1>during the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably get away with that</v>

252
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 1>whole trotline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe replace one or two that might slip</v>

253
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>out because you freeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

254
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason the lips.</v>

255
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that you tie him every three feet.</v>

256
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's your trotline big as a</v>

257
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>bullet about that big and buff fat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple inches.</v>

258
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Well they caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

259
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:07.381
<v Speaker 1>That's not A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

260
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 1>they'll slice them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they look like almost like fat eels,</v>

261
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little tiny or leeches.</v>

262
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Let me say leeches leeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you get out,</v>

263
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed sun up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only allowed two bushel without a</v>

264
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>permit.</v>

265
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>A license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're out there.</v>

266
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah.</v>

272

286
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>That's your wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end you have an empty spool of</v>

287
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Someone reaches over and they pull the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rope up,</v>

292
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 1>put it on the Spool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then your natural progression</v>

293
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:33.670
<v Speaker 1>forward slowly brings the line up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then set it back down the water and you</v>

294
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>got to go slow because those you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling those crabs up from the bottom</v>

295
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:41.480
<v Speaker 1>and they'll stay on the whole time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just fucking dip and dumping</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get the soft crabs,</v>

299
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are coming closer to shore</v>
<v Speaker 1>to molt their shelves so they can get</v>

300
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:54.360
<v Speaker 1>bigger and then those you take and we'd</v>

<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Eight feet,</v>

503
00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 3>three inches long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 30 pounds.</v>

504
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And that's a freshwater animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two to 300,</v>

505
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Speaker 3>27 broken bow lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oklahoma</v>

506
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.620
<v Speaker 3>is so to dolphins stuck together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at a fuck.</v>

507
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>And you look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an edible cut through this good.</v>

508
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 3>You cut through all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They caught that one in Nicaragua.</v>

509
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 3>So I guess they're all everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

510
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:05.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take them,</v>

511
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 3>you got to cut through that scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that scaly outside with wire cutters.</v>

512
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 3>And then once you get through all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

513
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 3>you take the meat and they really liked</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking it.</v>

514
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 3>They put it on a smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's apparently the best way to.</v>

515
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 3>This guy's a little baby ones in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish tank.</v>

516
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 3>There are vicious little creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they actually stay.</v>

517
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what's blows me away as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start that small.</v>

518
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's fucking with them right here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we mean you can.</v>

520
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I think you can have them in a fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>

521
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's feeding them a fish.</v>

522
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole fish.</v>

523
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dinosaurs.</v>

524
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long have alligator guards been</v>

525
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 3>around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out.</v>

526
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess.</v>

527
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess 30 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been that way.</v>

528
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 3>It might be more $30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million alligators I think has been.</v>

529
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.120
<v Speaker 3>They've been around before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs.</v>

530
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Straight down and they've been around I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think in the same forum since.</v>

531
00:22:57.851 --> 00:23:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Before that meteor hit looking like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

532
00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

533
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First description is 10.</v>

534
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

535
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 3>The first description of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

536
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.800
<v Speaker 3>but like how long have they been in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

537
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you find that out?</v>

538
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oldest fuck.</v>

539
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Dinosaur fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm used to seeing those people</v>

540
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 3>pull out big carp and catfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never.</v>

541
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

542
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>those are big ass fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bow hunt for them too.</v>

543
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was going to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one picture looked like it had a</v>

544
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 3>bow in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they do.</v>

545
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go in those those rivers and they do it</v>

546
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:37.270
<v Speaker 3>at night too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they'll have like spotlights.</v>

547
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.430
<v Speaker 3>So you see the fish in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're shooting something and it's like</v>

548
00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 3>six feet away from you and they use like</v>
<v Speaker 3>recurve bows that are made designed just</v>

549
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:48.380
<v Speaker 3>for both and they have like a spool on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and shoot it into it and then they</v>

550
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 3>just pull it in by hand or they have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real say how they pulling that thing</v>

551
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 3>wherever 300 pounds it takes forever.</v>

552
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some videos of guys catching</v>

553
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

554
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 3>When you watch them fight these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you get a video of a guy catching</v>

555
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.930
<v Speaker 3>an alligator Gar kinda test line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have for an alligator braided</v>

556
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 3>braided line that they have that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy duty braided line and they use a</v>

557
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 3>leader like a wire leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Ass fucking hooks go for up to 40</v>

558
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 3>grand for a aquarium and the Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 3>black market,</v>

559
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 3>it says 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those little ones,</v>

560
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 3>like we just saw the size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just says that the 40 grand in Japan.</v>

561
00:24:27.081 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen to as high as 40.</v>

562
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say black markets.</v>

563
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 3>It's probably illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's an article if someone</v>

564
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:35.410
<v Speaker 3>getting arrested for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

565
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Maryland.</v>

566
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 1>This thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the full story,</v>

567
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:42.500
<v Speaker 1>but it was called snake heads.</v>

568
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think somebody put them in the</v>

569
00:24:46.261 --> 00:24:48.750
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're from Africa and they bred.</v>

570
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing.</v>

571
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

572
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:54.270
<v Speaker 3>they take over those snake heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real common thing.</v>

573
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:57.660
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes what they do is they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>poison everything in the lake to kill</v>

574
00:24:57.661 --> 00:25:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the snake heads and then start from</v>
<v Speaker 3>scratch and the restock the lake.</v>

575
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.210
<v Speaker 3>So that's definitely somebody put that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

576
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:03.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

577
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:05.400
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think snake heads,</v>

578
00:25:05.401 --> 00:25:06.900
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're from Africa,</v>

579
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 3>but they're from somewhere else for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

580
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:11.910
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

583
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.653
<v Speaker 1>mouth?</v>

584
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just too tired by the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just gives up.</v>

585
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.980

<v Speaker 3>they are good to eat this.</v>

587
00:25:26.011 --> 00:25:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they taste delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you smoke them.</v>

588
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.290
<v Speaker 3>It's got to feel good to fight that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing all day.</v>

589
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Bring it in and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's got to feel good.</v>

590
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I've got some pretty good size fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing like that.</v>

591
00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:41.190

<v Speaker 3>fishing.</v>

594
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take you to bring it in?</v>

595
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.440
<v Speaker 3>About a half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's damn good.</v>

596
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that big.</v>

597
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Seventy pounds from Marlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

598
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:58.131
<v Speaker 3>The biggest guy in the boat said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've caught him close to a thousand</v>

599
00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.710
<v Speaker 3>pounds a thousand.</v>

604
00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:16.400

726
00:31:15.521 --> 00:31:17.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about this and</v>

727
00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>talking about this on stage a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

728
00:31:19.241 --> 00:31:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as depth goes to go out of the</v>

729
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:26.600
<v Speaker 1>most beautiful way I've ever seen any</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature on this little rocket outer</v>

730
00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:31.090
<v Speaker 1>space go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most original beautiful way is that</v>

731
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:36.091
<v Speaker 1>dove that got killed by Randy Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best death on planet earth.</v>

732
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.510
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

733
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>That place at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

734
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many billions of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>birds have been on this planet?</v>

735
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.860
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They died of,</v>

00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy Johnson fastball one,</v>

737
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.673
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

738
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 1>You could even narrow it down to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many birds were in that area that day.</v>

739
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't care that one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he hit it,</v>

740
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>it blew up into its own.</v>

741

<v Speaker 1>Like fireworks went out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

871
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I watched this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this video online.</v>

872
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 1>It was live videos of bald eagles having</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies and you could watch them.</v>

873
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Speaker 1>They had cameras set up on them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

874
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ended.</v>

875
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It ended terribly though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The they showed you how the mom would</v>

876
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:25.071
<v Speaker 1>sit and the dad would go out and hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he came back and he would just,</v>

877
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 1>his shift was like an hour or two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the rest of the time,</v>

878
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 1>but he would go out and bring food back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the poor thing,</v>

879
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the mom going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

880
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It got fucking hit by a commercial</v>
<v Speaker 1>airline.</v>

881
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Got Hit by jet on a landing and killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mom.</v>

882
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to help the birds</v>

883
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:47.690
<v Speaker 1>because the dads don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

884
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.340
<v Speaker 1>that would've been the end of their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that'll,</v>

885
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might.</v>

886
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 1>They're savage fucking birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bird Ravens to.</v>

887
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I learned about ravens being a raving</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>

888
00:37:58.231 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I watched this documentary one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the fucking lady in England had a</v>

889
00:38:01.381 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 1>rave in a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raven,</v>

890
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that British,</v>

891
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 1>that little that it's like an upside</v>
<v Speaker 1>down u.</v>

892
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>That car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird old car.</v>

893
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a little,</v>

894
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.130
<v Speaker 1>like a parentheses upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

895
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.300
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a pet raven.</v>

896
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:16.380
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

897
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're the most intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird and this thing.</v>

898
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 1>She would keep the keys in the ignition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the windows down and she'd be like,</v>

899
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go for a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the raven would fly into car,</v>

900
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.670
<v Speaker 1>start the car with its beak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit on the door.</v>

901
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 1>She'd get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd start driving,</v>

902
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>and then he would just fly right next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car wherever she.</v>

903
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 3>It was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

904
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I could knock it over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she had like a relationship with this</v>

905
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.290
<v Speaker 3>100 percent and this raven knew and</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved it.</v>

906
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

907
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 3>let me go start the car for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would say,</v>

908
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 3>let's go for a drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Raven knew what she was saying</v>

909
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 3>out out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom in the car,</v>

910
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.680
<v Speaker 3>grabbed that shit with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they're big.</v>

911
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:00.280
<v Speaker 3>They're big too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just turn those little keys and he</v>

912
00:39:00.281 --> 00:39:02.300
<v Speaker 3>would wait for her to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd start driving.</v>

913
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 3>You just fly right next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

914
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 3>You might look for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I watched it.</v>

915
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I saw video one using a tool to get</v>

916
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:13.070
<v Speaker 3>another tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that it could get into something like</v>

917
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>they did these tests to find out how</v>
<v Speaker 3>they intelligent they were to see if</v>

918
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:22.150
<v Speaker 3>they could do problem solving to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>food and so it had to use like one small</v>

919
00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 3>stick in order to pull out a larger</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick and the larger stick to pull out</v>

920
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 3>this thing that got them the food and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they figured it out and figured it out</v>

921
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:32.860
<v Speaker 3>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quicker than my kids would have this</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then the raven flies over to where</v>

957
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 3>the cat is and starts fucking with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after he starts fucking with them,</v>

958
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 3>then he flies over to where the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat is and he starts fucking with him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

998
00:42:49.861 --> 00:42:53.970
<v Speaker 3>look in comparative tests when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like problem solving there are as</v>

999
00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.460
<v Speaker 3>smart or smarter than chimpanzees.</v>

<v Speaker 3>limitation is that they've got these</v>

1004
00:43:03.961 --> 00:43:07.120
<v Speaker 3>feet and wings,</v>

1007
00:43:12.181 --> 00:43:15.330
<v Speaker 3>They might be able to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimps can kind of do stuff like that.</v>

1008
00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this Raven,</v>

1009
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.890
<v Speaker 3>a crow crow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raven pro.</v>

1010
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Pretty set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference?</v>

1011
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Is the Raven bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.240
<v Speaker 3>A lot bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1013
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.800
<v Speaker 3>but they're all smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this little fucker realizes that if</v>

1014
00:43:28.801 --> 00:43:32.250
<v Speaker 3>he puts these rocks in that water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the water float up and he'll be</v>

1015
00:43:32.251 --> 00:43:34.590
<v Speaker 3>able to get that food so you can't quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>reach that food.</v>

1016
00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.970
<v Speaker 3>So he keeps dropping those rocks in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there to try to raise the level of the</v>

1017
00:43:38.971 --> 00:43:41.940
<v Speaker 3>water up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck does he figure that out,</v>

1018
00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:42.610
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1020
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said he's like,</v>

1021
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1022
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.250
<v Speaker 3>not quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost almost</v>

1023
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.150
<v Speaker 3>wish I could just get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Gosh.</v>

1024
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Light versus heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this all kinds of experiments</v>

1025
00:43:57.731 --> 00:43:59.170
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1026
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says it's a casual understanding of</v>

1027
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:03.880
<v Speaker 3>water displacement by a cro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the name of the video</v>

1028
00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 3>study done by Auckland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand.</v>

1029
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:09.490
<v Speaker 3>The university will just makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1030
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we always define intelligence by</v>

1031
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.770
<v Speaker 3>how much can they manipulate and its</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1032
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.950
<v Speaker 3>And where that throws us off is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins and orcas and whales because</v>

1033
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:21.430
<v Speaker 3>they're really smart and they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't do anything.</v>

1034
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.680
<v Speaker 3>They have flippers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we know they have these really</v>

1035
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.940
<v Speaker 3>complex languages and Qa and they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have Baltimore accents.</v>

1036
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins,</v>

1037
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.770
<v Speaker 3>and orchids have accents do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 3>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't tell what the fuck they're</v>

1039
00:44:36.181 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can tell where they're from</v>

1040
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.870
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a regional thing,</v>

1041
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 3>not like a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nose versus a spotted has a different</v>

1042
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 3>accent from different spots of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1043
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 3>They have different accents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make different sounds.</v>

1044
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.150
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to fuck with bats when we were</v>

1046
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 3>little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever mess around bats?</v>

1047
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been in Austin for the largest</v>

1048
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:04.251
<v Speaker 3>migration in the northern hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Austin has the largest</v>

1049
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:09.831
<v Speaker 3>migration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like its largest daily migration of bats</v>

1050
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:11.100
<v Speaker 3>in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daily.</v>

1051
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy when it gets dark out.</v>

1052
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Look at all those bats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fly out from under the bridge.</v>

1053
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bridge in downtown Austin,</v>

1054
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1055
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're staying in this hotel and</v>

1056
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:24.481
<v Speaker 3>they're telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1057
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:27.240
<v Speaker 3>when it gets dark out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bridge over there,</v>

1058
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 3>they're like all the bats nest in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bridge and they come out.</v>

1059
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 3>So during the daytime I was with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>family with walked under the bridge and</v>

1060
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 3>you hear that cluster is hanging</v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath the bridge.</v>

1061
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 3>You go under the bridge here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit.</v>

1062
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Look at that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's millions.</v>

1063
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Millions and millions of fucking bats go</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying through the air.</v>

1064
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about?</v>

1065
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 3>What does it say there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this pull it back to?</v>

1066
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:57.330
<v Speaker 3>The beginning it says from March through</v>
<v Speaker 3>April,</v>

1067
00:45:57.331 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 3>millions of mostly female pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexican,</v>

1068
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 3>free tailed bats migrate north,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give birth the new Congress Avenue</v>

1069
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Bridge in downtown Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas is the spring and summer home to</v>

1070
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:10.440
<v Speaker 3>these bats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each night at sunset,</v>

1071
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:15.441
<v Speaker 3>some 2 million bats venture out from</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the bridge to eat an estimated</v>

1072
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.660
<v Speaker 3>30,000 pounds of insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the largest urban bat colony in</v>

1073
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he watched the departure play</v>

1074
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.590
<v Speaker 3>that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cc this departure.</v>

1075
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1076
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe how many bats fly out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1077
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:33.210
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they all just pick this one</v>

1078
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one bridge.</v>

1079
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 3>They decided this is our spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they just live in this bridge,</v>

1080
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 3>so somebody detonated that bridge.</v>

1081
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like night.</v>

1082
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1083
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:45.510
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there for this is.</v>

1084
00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:50.700
<v Speaker 3>It's wild to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just see them like like a swarm like</v>

1085
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 3>insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are they not running into each other</v>

1086
00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:55.110
<v Speaker 3>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knocking themselves down.</v>

1087
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how tight that is.</v>

1088
00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>A head butt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each other people could barely get on</v>

1089
00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:04.700
<v Speaker 3>the subway together without stepping on</v>
<v Speaker 3>toes and things are flying fly.</v>

1090
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.810
<v Speaker 3>They say that they have some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnetic sense.</v>

1091
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.140
<v Speaker 3>They understand like there's a frequency</v>
<v Speaker 3>that each one of those animals gives</v>

1092
00:47:13.141 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how birds do it.</v>

1093
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Like they ever see birds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They move together in these crazy</v>

1094
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.670
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.230
<v Speaker 3>No one understands it totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one,</v>

1096
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a company called Hex h e c x a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hecs and they make this thing called a</v>

1097
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 3>heck suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very controversial thing,</v>

1098
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but what the idea behind it is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an electric frequency that all</v>

1099
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 3>humans and animals and especially like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators game,</v>

1100
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 3>animals give off and that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this frequency is it corresponds to the</v>

1101
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 3>movement of your muscles and that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>give off this thing that that animals</v>

1102
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:50.830
<v Speaker 3>can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially predators like predators.</v>

1103
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Apparently a really good at seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but holy shit.</v>

1104
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Where are these local stores</v>

1105
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.010
<v Speaker 2>say now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been through something like that in</v>

1106
00:47:58.011 --> 00:47:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to have a while.</v>

1107
00:47:59.901 --> 00:48:00.410
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

1108
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.410
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cicadas would come through and it</v>

1109
00:48:03.411 --> 00:48:07.040
<v Speaker 2>would look like this and they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>litter the streets and the sidewalks.</v>

1110
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.373
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>locusts.</v>

1111
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.590
<v Speaker 3>That just grasshoppers under certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>

1112
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

1113
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Grasshoppers under certain conditions</v>
<v Speaker 3>become locus.</v>

1114
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

1115
00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean in five seconds he just filled</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Netapp.</v>

1116
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do with them though?</v>

1117
00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 3>You eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat them.</v>

1118
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'd eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm down to try different shit.</v>

1119
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had cricket chocolate covered</v>

1120
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>

1121
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:36.220
<v Speaker 3>We stayed at a resort once in Mexico and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go into the hotel room,</v>

1122
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like a little table there and</v>

1123
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 3>they have like a little table full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>peanuts with like,</v>

1124
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some hot,</v>

1125
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.340
<v Speaker 3>like hot chili powder on them and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1126
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And then they had these crickets in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowl and my kids like,</v>

1127
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 3>why do they have bugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1128
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1129
00:48:56.471 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 3>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not eating bugs.</v>

1130
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you these this year,</v>

1131
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 3>they eat these things.</v>

1132
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I picked him up and I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>chewing them.</v>

1133
00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not bad.</v>

1134
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.350
<v Speaker 3>They're like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like a soy sauce tastes.</v>

1135
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they done?</v>

1136
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they fry them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they fried these crickets,</v>

1137
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 3>but they're so common that they had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowl of them in the room,</v>

1138
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eat them.</v>

1139
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what I would try that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would try to,</v>

1140
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I would try that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm scared of that.</v>

1141
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.720
<v Speaker 3>They say that that might be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>futures of,</v>

1142
00:49:28.721 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the weather changes,</v>

1143
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 3>grasshoppers turned into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1144
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:35.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a weather issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thing I clicked on this from says that</v>

1145
00:49:35.651 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Speaker 3>just by swarming it makes them become a</v>
<v Speaker 3>locus.</v>

1146
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.060
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's accurate,</v>

1147
00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:42.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's what the article is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1148
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 3>well it's The New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you listen to Donald Trump,</v>

1149
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.630
<v Speaker 3>which fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1150
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to trust in New York Times.</v>

1151
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to fuck with us,</v>

1152
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 2>so we had a light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a street light in front of our house and</v>

1153
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:58.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother and I would go out and my dad</v>

1154
00:49:58.121 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go out and play catch as long as</v>

1155
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:01.570
<v Speaker 2>you're in front of that light and I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see you.</v>

1156
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Speaker 2>So we just go start playing catch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw a tennis ball round one night.</v>

1157
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:07.630
<v Speaker 2>We're just thrown at high up toward the</v>
<v Speaker 2>light so that you could see it coming</v>

1158
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:11.230
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this bat just starts sweeping at the</v>

1159
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 2>ball the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1160
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

1161
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 2>So I throw a line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive it my brother's fuck of faith,</v>

1162
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:21.700
<v Speaker 2>that fog of battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went right through his hair that the</v>

1163
00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:25.060
<v Speaker 2>gay became became.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be a fucking man.</v>

1164
00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 2>It's take that shit at your face and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1165
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.250
<v Speaker 3>would come down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would touch you.</v>

1166
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:33.390
<v Speaker 3>You think the ball was another bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1167
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I maybe all the sonar coming after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it thought it was a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>or realized it was a too big of a bug</v>

1169
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.510
<v Speaker 3>when it got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1170
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.480
<v Speaker 3>But it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would hit,</v>

1171
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 3>it would come right by your fucking face</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1172
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Probably thought is another bat or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to eat.</v>

1173
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1174
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

1175
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I was seeing this heck suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were these things to destroy their,</v>

1176
00:50:55.810 --> 00:51:00.810
<v Speaker 3>their big with people that go spear</v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing and they wear this suit and you</v>

1177
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:04.130
<v Speaker 3>can like literally get right next to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish with his suit on.</v>

1178
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 3>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whatever this,</v>

1179
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.300
<v Speaker 3>whatever this frequency that human</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies and bodies in general give off.</v>

1180
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:15.840
<v Speaker 3>This suit masks it and they've been able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show that with these devices like</v>

1181
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 3>that measure electrical frequencies.</v>

1182
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:23.060
<v Speaker 3>You can rub your arm over Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like these alligators.</v>

1183
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.590
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

1184
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck with this dude while he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing that.</v>

1185
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a crocodile to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you're moving and there's</v>

1186
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:37.020
<v Speaker 3>what you are and they just don't bother</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand that it figured out.</v>

1187
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>

1188
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:42.830
<v Speaker 3>super smart dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when apparently dudes wear these</v>

1189
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:44.600
<v Speaker 3>suits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they go spear fishing,</v>

1190
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.780
<v Speaker 3>they're way more successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love these things because you can</v>

1191
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 3>get like right up next to these fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck them up,</v>

1192
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 3>but hunters used them to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're.</v>

1193
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>They're becoming popular with hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1194
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:58.520
<v Speaker 3>so they don't work just in the water and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

1195
00:51:58.521 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I've worn them before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're working or not</v>

1196
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard to tell because what</v>

1197
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.040
<v Speaker 3>animals go by is not one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go buy a bunch of different things.</v>

1198
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 3>The the big one is smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they smell you,</v>

1199
00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:12.410
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the reason why Cammo works is cammo</v>

1200
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 3>breaks up your outline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like have like a deer saw you.</v>

1201
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:16.821
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1202
00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:19.070
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

1203
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I see the arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the leg,</v>

1204
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 3>that's a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you were on camera with all the</v>

1205
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 3>broke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my shorts,</v>

1206
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 3>like these shorts broken up pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1207
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 3>So that broken up pattern confuses them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1208
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I'm seeing.</v>

1209
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 3>And if you just stand still and you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Cammo and you don't move a dear look</v>

1210
00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:37.400
<v Speaker 3>at you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean shit.</v>

1211
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:39.770
<v Speaker 3>And they'll go back to eating unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're close,</v>

1212
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 3>but the smell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1213
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:43.140
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Especially that real tree stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see these days look so authentic.</v>

1215
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not the stuff that works the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best is not interesting.</v>

1216
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.970
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Authentic is not what works the best.</v>

1217
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:55.790
<v Speaker 3>What works the best is like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1218
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:58.580
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different companies that make</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good camera,</v>

1219
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.040
<v Speaker 3>but the secret behind it is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking up.</v>

1220
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 3>The outline doesn't have to look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1221
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of like breaking it</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with like blotches and spots and</v>

1222
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.250
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of companies like under</v>
<v Speaker 3>armour actually has a really good</v>

1223
00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:11.660
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called rich reaper,</v>

1224
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 3>reaper baron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that pattern is really good.</v>

1225
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Sitka has probably the best pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a pattern called a sub alpine</v>

1226
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 3>open country sub Alpine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called,</v>

1227
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a bunch of dots and splotches.</v>

1228
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 3>The whole idea is just to break up your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your outline.</v>

1229
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 3>So when someone looks at you or an</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal looks at you,</v>

1230
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what the fuck they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

1231
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.230
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that this heck suit</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another,</v>

1232
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:40.920
<v Speaker 3>it blocks out your electrical output.</v>

1233
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that frequency is that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals can see and it's,</v>

1234
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1235
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 3>it's real weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we know that there's something</v>

1236
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 3>that gives off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these hex companies that they've,</v>

1237
00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one company,</v>

1238
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 3>they have this machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll show you,</v>

1239
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 3>that you wave your hand over this thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>without a heck suit on and it registers</v>

1240
00:53:58.801 --> 00:54:02.320
<v Speaker 3>this electrical frequency and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wave it with the hexagon and it</v>

1241
00:54:02.321 --> 00:54:05.130
<v Speaker 3>registers nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they smell you,</v>

1242
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 3>you're still fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1243
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:11.991
<v Speaker 3>these birds somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all given off a frequency so</v>

1244
00:54:12.211 --> 00:54:15.090
<v Speaker 3>that when they're doing that crazy wave</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're flying,</v>

1245
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 3>they're flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1246
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 3>So they're beating their wings together</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bunch of fucking helicopters,</v>

1247
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:23.070
<v Speaker 3>but they're not touching each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just floating back and forth</v>

1248
00:54:23.071 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 3>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Somehow it works.</v>

1249
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be inches apart,</v>

1250
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 3>inches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inches.</v>

1251
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's these huge migrations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds that are flying through the air</v>

1252
00:54:34.051 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 3>and they moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fish in the ocean,</v>

1253
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 3>the same sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1254
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 3>And they say that's how fish do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have this frequency that</v>

1255
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:43.860
<v Speaker 3>they're all giving off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some somehow or another,</v>

1256
00:54:43.861 --> 00:54:47.130
<v Speaker 3>they all know how to move in tandem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Nolan's fuck,</v>

1257
00:54:47.131 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 3>oh well we're going left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Bad to each other.</v>

1258
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:55.260
<v Speaker 3>There's no straggler either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one guy off the fucking side.</v>

1259
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.290
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it,</v>

1260
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 3>but people are trying to capitalize on</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that is or high mask,</v>

1261
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 3>whatever frequency we give off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that we don't really</v>

1262
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 3>totally understand animal senses with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've done a bunch of tests on deere.</v>

1263
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:15.090
<v Speaker 3>They know they're colorblind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't see necessarily Greens and.</v>

1264
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.220
<v Speaker 3>But they see shapes and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see,</v>

1265
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their real concern is movement and</v>

1266
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:24.450
<v Speaker 3>outline the outline of a person who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very recognizable movement is very</v>

1267
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:27.150
<v Speaker 3>recognizable when they smell pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

1268
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 3>but they don't smell nearly as good as</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like bear is apparently one of</v>

1269
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:35.250
<v Speaker 3>the best at like using their nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bear smell.</v>

1270
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Anything like bears can smell a dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

1271
00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>

1272
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:40.320
<v Speaker 3>miles away.</v>

1273
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1274
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that would make me nervous if I saw a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead animal and I was in bear country</v>

1275
00:55:45.711 --> 00:55:47.330

<v Speaker 2>But we're getting a fuck outta here.</v>

1279
00:55:57.051 --> 00:55:59.570

<v Speaker 2>There's no assigned parking spaces and</v>

1280
00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:02.330
<v Speaker 2>there's no driveway or anything and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother pulls out in front of this guy</v>

1281
00:56:02.331 --> 00:56:03.340

<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1286
00:56:08.871 --> 00:56:10.130
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1287
00:56:10.131 --> 00:56:12.260
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that night,</v>

1288
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:16.700
<v Speaker 2>assuming that guy breaks into his car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bust his windows out,</v>

1289
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:19.040

<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had some deer piss from hunting.</v>

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Any fucking busted that guys when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumped it all in his vents and</v>

1292
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:29.831
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So they're taking turns breaking each</v>

1294
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:36.520
<v Speaker 2>other's what ended after the deer piss</v>
<v Speaker 2>went in there,</v>

1295
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the last of that shit because</v>

1296
00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever use that?</v>

1297
00:56:40.091 --> 00:56:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't ever put it on,</v>

1298
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:46.600
<v Speaker 2>That stuff's supposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't the smell of it just sitting</v>

1300
00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 2>on the sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1301
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:48.980
<v Speaker 2>good God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I would think a deer would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that though?</v>

1303
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Pissing all verse of that crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

1304
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to know if people really use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1305
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:56.390
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

1306
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:59.720
<v Speaker 3>They use a cow estrus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like a,</v>

1307
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.990
<v Speaker 3>a smell of a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cow Bull.</v>

1308
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Like A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a cow bull,</v>

1309
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:08.330
<v Speaker 3>a cow elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The put it on trees and shit.</v>

1310
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Try to drag a bowl over because when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when bulls are in,</v>

1311
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:14.090
<v Speaker 3>when they're in the Rut and the females</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in heat,</v>

1312
00:57:14.091 --> 00:57:17.060
<v Speaker 3>when they come into estrus and the males</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to breed them,</v>

1313
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.330
<v Speaker 3>apparently they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just smell it and they go fucking</v>

1314
00:57:20.331 --> 00:57:23.840
<v Speaker 3>bananas and some people use that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll put it on trees and stuff.</v>

1315
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:27.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I wanted to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that more to mask our smell or is it</v>

1316
00:57:27.471 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 3>more to attract?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're attracted to attracting them.</v>

1317
00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way they mask our smell,</v>

1318
00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 3>their sense of smell is so powerful that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible to mask it unless</v>

1319
00:57:38.451 --> 00:57:41.720
<v Speaker 3>you use ozone and so would a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1320
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.550
<v Speaker 3>There's a company called Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xanax,</v>

1321
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:48.290
<v Speaker 3>and what they do is they'll literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang a unit above their head and it</v>

1322
00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:53.291
<v Speaker 3>blows ozone gas all over your body and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it collects like your scent gets</v>

1323
00:57:55.431 --> 00:58:00.080
<v Speaker 3>combined with the ozone and that hits</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deer and the deer doesn't know what</v>

1324
00:58:00.081 --> 00:58:01.970
<v Speaker 3>the fuck you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1325
00:58:01.971 --> 00:58:03.680
<v Speaker 3>what is that smell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1326
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.180
<v Speaker 3>if you ever smelled ozone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1327
00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:06.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

1328
00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll turn on my tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1329
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:08.853
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1330
00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.690
<v Speaker 3>flotation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could smell it because they use</v>

1331
00:58:11.691 --> 00:58:14.210
<v Speaker 3>ozone to clean the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to purify everything.</v>

1332
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.230
<v Speaker 3>It's got a very distinct smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you turn the tank filtration</v>

1333
00:58:18.231 --> 00:58:20.570
<v Speaker 3>system on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to go in it for half</v>

1334
00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.160
<v Speaker 3>an hour and the ozone disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dissipates.</v>

1335
00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:26.840
<v Speaker 3>But it's got a very distinct smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently that smell just</v>

1336
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.040
<v Speaker 3>overwhelms the smell of human body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when guys sit under a tree stand,</v>

1337
00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.440
<v Speaker 3>like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've hunted with my friend John Dudley</v>

1338
00:58:34.441 --> 00:58:38.000
<v Speaker 3>and Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he uses this Ozon ics unit above us.</v>

1339
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
<v Speaker 3>He sets it out there on the tree above</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and turns it on.</v>

1340
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:44.420
<v Speaker 3>And it blows ozone over you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While you're sitting in a tree,</v>

1341
00:58:44.421 --> 00:58:49.421
<v Speaker 3>so even if a deer downwind of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not bolt because the smell is</v>

1342
00:58:49.671 --> 00:58:52.880
<v Speaker 3>confusing to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that fucking weird smell</v>

1343
00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.050
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what it is.</v>

1344
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Like if they smell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1345
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:57.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the dude got to go out.</v>

1346
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just a whiff that the wind will</v>

1347
00:58:59.301 --> 00:59:00.320
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

1348
00:59:00.321 --> 00:59:02.090
<v Speaker 3>most of the times the wind's blowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>east,</v>

1349
00:59:02.091 --> 00:59:03.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then a little bit west,</v>

1350
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.450
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like the fuck.</v>

1351
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:07.880
<v Speaker 3>They don't take any chances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just run.</v>

1352
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.830
<v Speaker 3>But if they smelled that ozone stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1353
00:59:09.831 --> 00:59:12.230
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this fuck?</v>

1354
00:59:12.231 --> 00:59:17.231
<v Speaker 3>Is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1355
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:18.743
<v Speaker 3>I just run.</v>

1356
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they just stand</v>

1357
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 3>there when they're horny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what their debts.</v>

1358
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1359
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 3>why people like the hunt them in the Rut</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when they're in the Rut,</v>

1360
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:33.020
<v Speaker 3>they come out during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of times the older animals,</v>

1361
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:36.620
<v Speaker 3>they become nocturnal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just decided it's too risky during</v>

1362
00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 3>the day people are up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just just fuck around all night and</v>

1363
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 3>sleep during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when I was always scared because</v>

1364
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 3>we would have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's deer running all over Maryland</v>

1365
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:48.020
<v Speaker 3>when you're driving those country roads</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>

1366
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:50.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four of them will come out cross and in</v>

1367
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:50.991
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1368
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster,</v>

1369
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1370
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.280
<v Speaker 3>so we had deer whistles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if they ever really worked to be</v>

1371
00:59:58.281 --> 00:59:59.220
<v Speaker 3>honest with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 3>You put them in the front of your car</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you don't hear it.</v>

1373
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:03.710
<v Speaker 3>But apparently they hear it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to.</v>

1374
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 3>But I had them on and it would still</v>
<v Speaker 3>come right up to the edge of the road</v>

1375
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:07.490
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1376
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 3>they won the ruts going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get confused.</v>

1377
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.980
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just horny and crazy.</v>

1378
01:00:12.981 --> 01:00:15.620
<v Speaker 3>They'll run right out in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smashed by cars.</v>

1379
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Deers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would hide all day long during any</v>

1380
01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:20.580
<v Speaker 3>other time of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

1381
01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:23.830
<v Speaker 3>they just smelled that deer posting just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1382
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1383
01:00:25.641 --> 01:00:29.030
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine that their nose is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand times stronger than ours?</v>

1384
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the smell of that posts.</v>

1385
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 3>It must be so tempting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Run out in traffic in the middle of the</v>

1386
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For it,</v>

1387
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1388
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 3>and you only got a couple of weeks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1389
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 3>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it not like they fuck all year</v>

1390
01:00:45.261 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 3>like us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got a couple of weeks to get there,</v>

1391
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:51.760
<v Speaker 3>fuck on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the rest of the year solo know</v>

1392
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 3>how weird is it?</v>

1393
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of a strange system did</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature come up with?</v>

1394
01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:02.130
<v Speaker 3>What makes the girls horny and able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give birth only for a couple of like six</v>

1395
01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.930
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they go into estrus again,</v>

1396
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 3>like you have like a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second estrus,</v>

1397
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.230
<v Speaker 3>and then they all figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1398
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:17.830
<v Speaker 3>it's a male's song and you start</v>
<v Speaker 3>smelling fucking thinking less.</v>

1399
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Apparently as good as they smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bear smells hundreds of times stronger</v>

1400
01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:25.400
<v Speaker 3>than them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say a bear smells hundreds of times</v>

1401
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:28.070
<v Speaker 3>better than a bloodhound does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That blows my mind.</v>

1402
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Great Miles blows my mind mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles away.</v>

1403
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.710
<v Speaker 3>When I drive from here and I get two</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>

1404
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn.</v>

1405
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a long fucking way to smell.</v>

1406
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>So what they say is really scary is if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in places where bears know that</v>

1407
01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 3>people hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hear a gunshot and they think it's</v>

1408
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:46.730
<v Speaker 3>a dinner bill.</v>

1409
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.180
<v Speaker 3>So like if you shoot a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only have a certain amount of time</v>

1410
01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:52.910
<v Speaker 3>to get that fucking deer out of there</v>
<v Speaker 3>before bear shows up.</v>

1411
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Especially like Kodiak Island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kodiak island is famous for two things,</v>

1412
01:01:57.831 --> 01:02:01.640
<v Speaker 3>is famous for gigantic brown bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the biggest barriers in the</v>

1413
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:04.230
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also famous for Sitka blacktail</v>

1414
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>

1415
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 3>these sit deer are really delicious deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people go over there to hunt them.</v>

1416
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:14.230
<v Speaker 3>But when that gunfire Supine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bear hears that as a group and they</v>

1417
01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.000
<v Speaker 3>go straight towards the sound of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>gunfire because they know there's going</v>

1418
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 3>to be a gut pile there soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if you miss</v>

1419
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably one coming your way.</v>

1420
01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Probably no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta you bought.</v>

1421
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to dress it out there too or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got to get it and haul it out.</v>

1422
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 3>If you got it and leave the gut pile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the meat away,</v>

1423
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 3>you're likely to just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bare probably gonna go to the guts</v>

1424
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to be safe damn</v>

1425
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 3>keyword.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

1426
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:38.754
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1427
01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking around the Kodiak bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steven Rinella,</v>

1428
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 3>who was talking about before they got</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacked last year,</v>

1429
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 3>they got on a fog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck island in Alaska.</v>

1430
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 3>They got attacked by a gigantic brown</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear and they said it was like 11 feet</v>

1431
01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was huge.</v>

1432
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:56.090
<v Speaker 3>And one of the guys like it ran into</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

1433
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened was they had shot an elk</v>

1434
01:02:58.290 --> 01:02:59.440
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1435
01:02:59.490 --> 01:02:59.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1436
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.920
<v Speaker 3>when you shoot an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an enormous animal.</v>

1437
01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 3>You can't really take it out all in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip.</v>

1438
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 3>You got to make several trips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they hung some of it up in a tree and</v>

1439
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 3>then they went back to get the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it after they took what they took,</v>

1440
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 3>what they could carry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went back to get the rest of it.</v>

1441
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.360
<v Speaker 3>When they went back to get the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1442
01:03:15.361 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 3>a bear had already claimed it and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know the bear claim because the</v>

1443
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 3>bear took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and heard them comment.</v>

1444
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 3>And then the bear when they were hanging</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the meat,</v>

1445
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:26.410
<v Speaker 3>the was like fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and decided just to make a run out</v>

1446
01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:28.050
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but didn't know how many there were</v>

1447
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:31.400
<v Speaker 3>because it's such thick brush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said it was,</v>

1448
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 3>it happened so quickly like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>had this,</v>

1449
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 3>well if a bear comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this.</v>

1450
01:03:35.101 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have this idea.</v>

1451
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens so fast.</v>

1452
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you the podcast because it's</v>

1453
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a two part podcast.</v>

1454
01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 3>They did it over two parts where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talked about the experience but</v>

1455
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody got hurt.</v>

1456
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:52.791
<v Speaker 3>But one guy wound up actually writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bears that delay or loud into them</v>

1457
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 3>and one guy hit the bear with a trekking</v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks like mountain trekking stick hit</v>

1458
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:01.890
<v Speaker 3>in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other guy got knocked over and</v>

1459
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 3>was literally on the bears back for</v>
<v Speaker 3>several steps as it was running down the</v>

1460
01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 3>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he fell off of it and then the</v>

1461
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:09.040
<v Speaker 3>bear took off.</v>

1462
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>That thing had momentum downhill coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>

1463
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this video.</v>

1464
01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.840
<v Speaker 3>They said it was so big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my friends who were there,</v>

1465
01:04:16.841 --> 01:04:19.570
<v Speaker 3>four of my friends were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying that they could see the</v>

1466
01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:23.740
<v Speaker 3>teeth 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>11 inches from their face gnashing as</v>

1467
01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:28.270
<v Speaker 3>the thing ran by 11 foot long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking what,</v>

1468
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.070
<v Speaker 3>1800 pounds.</v>

1469
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So while they're gone on round trip one</v>
<v Speaker 1>disparate already claimed it,</v>

1470
01:04:34.061 --> 01:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>got scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard them come and then saw,</v>

1471
01:04:35.951 --> 01:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>oh you're taking my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

1472
01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And came back to the defendant.</v>

1473
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it didn't,</v>

1474
01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.030
<v Speaker 3>it didn't come by to chase him off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came to fight.</v>

1475
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.470
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't know how many there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was like seven or eight guys I</v>

1476
01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.480
<v Speaker 3>think at least I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1477
01:04:49.481 --> 01:04:51.370
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least five guys.</v>

1478
01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:55.000
<v Speaker 3>And so I think it just got confused that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were so many people and didn't</v>

1479
01:04:55.001 --> 01:04:57.370
<v Speaker 3>know where to go or what to do and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got hit in the head with a tracking</v>

1480
01:04:57.371 --> 01:05:00.590
<v Speaker 3>sticks and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bag.</v>

1481
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:05.260
<v Speaker 3>But like one of my friends had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend remy had a pistol just for</v>

1482
01:05:05.261 --> 01:05:06.430
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just for bears,</v>

1483
01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but he had said is packed down and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1484
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.960
<v Speaker 3>in his mind he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if a bear comes I'll be able to get</v>

1485
01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:12.040
<v Speaker 3>to my pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

1486
01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.480
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens so fast.</v>

1487
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:15.700
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting to your pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no nothing.</v>

1488
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>And these are guys that know what fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

1489
01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>They're professionals</v>

1490
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 3>with plans in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're out in the woods hundreds of</v>

1491
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:26.910
<v Speaker 3>days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so weak were so we're like just</v>

1492
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:32.430
<v Speaker 3>water balloons for a fellow man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just,</v>

1493
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 3>we're nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things are like when you watch</v>

1494
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:39.700
<v Speaker 3>them fight each other and they're biting</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other's faces and shaking each</v>

1495
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:42.340
<v Speaker 3>other back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it still doesn't hurt them.</v>

1496
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1497
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so fleshy.</v>

1498
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.810

1592
01:09:51.331 --> 01:09:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to,</v>

1593
01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.920
<v Speaker 2>we used to fuck with like if there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl in high school and I'm like,</v>

01:09:55.921 --> 01:09:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't just talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to play video games.</v>

1595
01:09:58.351 --> 01:10:00.210
<v Speaker 2>He would set dates up and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1599
01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.790
<v Speaker 2>he would play with snakes and he catched</v>
<v Speaker 2>black snakes all the time.</v>

1600
01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.770
<v Speaker 2>We'd put them in an aquarium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go the,</v>

1601
01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>the pet store and get little feed mice</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'd be dead.</v>

1603
01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:22.380
<v Speaker 2>So my brother would reach in and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>dance the tail and these snakes would</v>

1604
01:10:22.381 --> 01:10:23.820
<v Speaker 2>bite him in the fucking hand and I'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And he wouldn't even.</v>

1606
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.900
<v Speaker 2>He just keep looking at the snake and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rub his handling.</v>

<v Speaker 3>who have day jobs,</v>

1708
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 3>people have night jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have computer jobs,</v>

1709

<v Speaker 3>going into the everglades,</v>

1712
01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:43.330

<v Speaker 3>They're saying adventure and a desire to</v>

1713
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:48.331
<v Speaker 3>defend the everglades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What thrills me is the fight,</v>

1714
01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:53.641
<v Speaker 3>the fight that the snake gives you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe one day you won't when you're</v>

1715
01:14:54.341 --> 01:14:56.650

<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1718
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.460
<v Speaker 3>When they get that big where they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>swallow a deer.</v>

1719
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean a deer's hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a small deer.</v>

1720
01:15:03.891 --> 01:15:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not big like a giant mule deer.</v>

1721
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Anything like if you have that one that</v>

<v Speaker 2>They let them do what they did.</v>

1790
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've read before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they couldn't get them on anything.</v>

1791
01:18:28.491 --> 01:18:31.940
<v Speaker 2>So they got him on tax evasion and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he developed syphilis they didn't</v>

1792
01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:33.330
<v Speaker 2>treat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1797
01:18:40.761 --> 01:18:43.850
<v Speaker 3>reason why all those dudes in the olden</v>
<v Speaker 3>days had powdered wigs?</v>

1798
01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.690
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:18:45.691 --> 01:18:46.221
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1800
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:49.870
<v Speaker 3>I should come here for my education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn Goofy as education.</v>

1801
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:52.740
<v Speaker 3>You miss out a lot of critical shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

1802
01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I repeat it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've.</v>

1803
01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 3>We've covered this several times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll just be really brief.</v>

1804
01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 3>There was a these royals from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it France?</v>

1805
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie will come to the store,</v>

1806
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 3>but they got syphilis and to cover their</v>
<v Speaker 3>syphilis,</v>

1807
01:19:10.221 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 3>they started wearing wigs and syphilis</v>
<v Speaker 3>was running rampant through this.</v>

1808
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:16.910
<v Speaker 3>So all these rich people started wearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>wigs.</v>

1809
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:18.830
<v Speaker 3>So these big ass wigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I ask you,</v>

1810
01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:22.610
<v Speaker 3>what was it eating their skin like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it like a psoriasis and shit?</v>

1811
01:19:22.611 --> 01:19:23.860
<v Speaker 3>They use noticeable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:19:23.861 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 3>The hair falls out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls out a big patchy.</v>

1813
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:30.300
<v Speaker 3>The reason they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was all to be majestic and</v>

1814
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.800
<v Speaker 3>became that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It became that and the bigger the wig</v>

1815
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:35.450
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more money you had,</v>

1816
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:37.670
<v Speaker 3>like if you had a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a big crazy wait.</v>

1817
01:19:37.671 --> 01:19:40.060
<v Speaker 3>That's why we call like rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigwigs.</v>

1818
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Why do people wear powdered wigs like</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys?</v>

1819
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 3>And it all came out of these two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two brothers,</v>

1820
01:19:48.081 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 3>I think they were serious for nearly two</v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>

1821
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:55.841
<v Speaker 3>Powdered wigs called parex were all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rage that cheek chic hairpieces would</v>

1822
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 3>have become pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

1823
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.250
<v Speaker 3>would have never become popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1824
01:20:01.251 --> 01:20:03.140
<v Speaker 3>if it hadn't been for a venereal</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

1825
01:20:03.141 --> 01:20:06.320
<v Speaker 3>a pair of self conscious kings and poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair hygiene,</v>

1826
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:09.030
<v Speaker 3>the proof begins like many others with</v>
<v Speaker 3>syphilis,</v>

1827
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 3>by 1580,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the std had become one of the worst</v>

1828
01:20:11.731 --> 01:20:14.600
<v Speaker 3>epidemic is tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eastern Europe was strike Europe rather</v>

1829
01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.950
<v Speaker 3>since the black plague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And according to William,</v>

1830
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 3>close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an infinite multitude of syphilis.</v>

1831
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Patients Clog London hospitals and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>filtered each day without antibiotics.</v>

1832
01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Victim face the full brunt of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

1833
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:28.470
<v Speaker 3>open sores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty rashes,</v>

1834
01:20:28.471 --> 01:20:30.810
<v Speaker 3>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dementia and patchy hair loss.</v>

1835
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Baldness swept the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1836
01:20:34.321 --> 01:20:38.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dudes Louis the 14th,</v>

1837
01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 3>it was only 17 when his mom started</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinning,</v>

1838
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.690
<v Speaker 3>worried about baldus would hurt his</v>
<v Speaker 3>reputation.</v>

1839
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Louis hired 48 wig makers to save as</v>
<v Speaker 3>image.</v>

1840
01:20:45.481 --> 01:20:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the King of England,</v>

1841
01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Louise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cousin Charles the second did the same</v>

1842
01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:53.340
<v Speaker 3>thing when his hair started to go gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both men likely had syphilis.</v>

1843
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Cordy Aes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that how you say that,</v>

1844
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.430
<v Speaker 3>cody?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go with that.</v>

1845
01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:00.150
<v Speaker 3>And other aristocrats immediately copied</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two kings.</v>

1846
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:03.930
<v Speaker 3>They supported wigs and the style</v>
<v Speaker 3>trickled down to the upper middle class.</v>

1847
01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Your Europe's newest fad was born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that crazy.</v>

1848
01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:08.430
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See where it says there,</v>

1849
01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:09.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1850
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.520
<v Speaker 3>the bill for large elaborate Peru</v>
<v Speaker 3>balloon to as high as 800 shillings.</v>

1851
01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:20.480
<v Speaker 3>That turn the word big wig was coined to</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe snobs who could afford big,</v>

1852
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 3>poofy Perutz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the average was 25 and they're paying</v>

1853
01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 3>upwards of 800.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Look at these dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had like crazy wigs,</v>

1855
01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:30.660
<v Speaker 3>like who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those wigs shit.</v>

1856
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.370
<v Speaker 3>All because of an STD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:21:32.371 --> 01:21:35.700
<v Speaker 3>They all were bald with fucking sores</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit everywhere.</v>

1858
01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 3>It looks like one on his feet flat on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his face.</v>

1859
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Probably got a hole in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Losing his teeth still still fucking was</v>

1860
01:21:45.411 --> 01:21:48.150
<v Speaker 3>still fogging up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Semi getting a semi hard.</v>

1861
01:21:48.190 --> 01:21:50.640
<v Speaker 3>They're shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're poisoning into people</v>

1862
01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:53.110
<v Speaker 1>on an education here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1863
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:58.470
<v Speaker 1>imagined life before antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine life before like the</v>

1864
01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:03.190
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People did shit.</v>

1865
01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were having a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about like,</v>

1866
01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.960
<v Speaker 1>how do people do this in the covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>wagon?</v>

1867
01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Like just going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1868
01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>They still do in bathtubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these assholes and rice fields.</v>

1869
01:22:12.401 --> 01:22:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I was reading these things about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies that'll go out and rice field and</v>

1870
01:22:15.071 --> 01:22:18.520
<v Speaker 1>stand in the hold and they'll drop it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the water.</v>

1871
01:22:18.730 --> 01:22:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it goes in water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just natural and squat and then</v>

1872
01:22:22.241 --> 01:22:26.200
<v Speaker 1>they'll just have it and have someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to catch it and fuck.</v>

1873
01:22:26.201 --> 01:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

1874
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I think in Baltimore and mercy it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Mercy Hospital.</v>

1875
01:22:30.551 --> 01:22:33.430
<v Speaker 1>They were the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they pioneered the</v>

1876
01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:36.160
<v Speaker 1>underwater birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can go get in a tub there,</v>

1877
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:38.650
<v Speaker 1>a big tub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they say,</v>

1878
01:22:38.651 --> 01:22:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the most natural way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a baby.</v>

1879
01:22:41.051 --> 01:22:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess it makes sense if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>placenta and you're just basically</v>

1880
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:47.770
<v Speaker 1>transferring into another one before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out instead of just boom out.</v>

1881
01:22:47.771 --> 01:22:49.870
<v Speaker 1>But they say it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it's natural.</v>

1882
01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean how can it be natural waters not</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to it either.</v>

1883
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.413
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breathe?</v>

1884
01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't know that quick and</v>

1885
01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 1>bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1886
01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:03.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's in like a tank and you sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She sits in there and then they just</v>

1887
01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>deliver it in this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big water tank.</v>

1888
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Like how's it kid breathing when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the womb?</v>

1889
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about that.</v>

1890
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Have literally never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they're attached to the umbilical</v>

1891
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 3>cord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biblical cord.</v>

1892
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:17.200
<v Speaker 3>They're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

1893
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.030
<v Speaker 3>They're all curled up in a fetal</v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

1894
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.530
<v Speaker 3>How they get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1895
01:23:20.531 --> 01:23:22.580
<v Speaker 3>what's it going through the court?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1896
01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think all life comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1897
01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:27.940
<v Speaker 3>The court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do they not have to breathe while</v>

1898
01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:30.520
<v Speaker 3>they're still attached to the court?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

1899
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fetus is not actually breathing</v>

1900
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:37.830
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mother breeds for the fetus and</v>

1901
01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 3>essential oxygen is passed to the fetus</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the umbilical cord to the fetus</v>

1902
01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 3>does not make breathing like movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1903
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 3>These began at nine weeks of pregnancy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and allow the fetus to practice this</v>

1904
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.400
<v Speaker 3>breathing movement movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man,</v>

1905
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:54.760
<v Speaker 3>that is just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really weird?</v>

1906
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:56.110
<v Speaker 3>You take a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you chuck them in the water.</v>

1907
01:23:56.111 --> 01:23:58.210
<v Speaker 3>They immediately hold their breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know exactly what to do,</v>

1908
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.610
<v Speaker 3>but monkeys don't throw a monkey in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

1909
01:24:00.611 --> 01:24:03.160
<v Speaker 3>They fucking panic and start breathing</v>
<v Speaker 3>water and they die.</v>

1910
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps to now kick.</v>

1911
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 3>I can't get over the education.</v>

1912
01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.190
<v Speaker 3>We tell it to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you know chinchillas drown in the</v>

1913
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Joe Rogan?</v>

1914
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I did 100 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all ground 100 rounds.</v>

1915
01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 3>This must have a peer review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:24:20.921 --> 01:24:23.890
<v Speaker 3>There's something about people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know how to hold our breath even when</v>

1917
01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:25.620
<v Speaker 3>we're babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone takes a look like that</v>

1918
01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:28.060
<v Speaker 3>nirvana picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that baby?</v>

1919
01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:31.030
<v Speaker 3>That was a real baby swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kids love it as long as you do it</v>

1920
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 3>to them on an early age and you're there</v>
<v Speaker 3>to catch them,</v>

1921
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:33.881
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is horrible.</v>

1922
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Don't watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't show me this.</v>

1923
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>baptism.</v>

1924
01:24:38.621 --> 01:24:43.621
<v Speaker 3>That slamming this baby into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What races that were Greek Orthodox.</v>

1925
01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

1926
01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.260
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy shit of what somebody said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Sarah sent me that.</v>

1927
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

1928
01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Or babies in a pool and that popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's end all this baby stuff.</v>

1929
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.040
<v Speaker 3>That's how the horrible thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1930
01:24:57.041 --> 01:25:00.550
<v Speaker 3>They smash that kid into the water and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick them up by their arms and smash</v>

1931
01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:03.850
<v Speaker 3>them down in the water again and they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it a bunch of times and then they cut</v>

1932
01:25:03.851 --> 01:25:05.340
<v Speaker 3>his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 3>slice and dice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was glad I didn't have a boy because</v>

1937
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:15.244
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Three girls.</v>

1941
01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:20.680
<v Speaker 3>If you had a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd you get?</v>

1942
01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Circumcised?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I,</v>

1943
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:24.630

<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It happens every year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every year to shot a little</v>

1950

1951
01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:44.680
<v Speaker 3>kids get infections from circumcisions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they lose their Dick every year.</v>

1952
01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

1953
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:49.690
<v Speaker 3>this has happened multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids have been circumcised by a</v>

1954

<v Speaker 3>traditional,</v>

1956
01:25:54.641 --> 01:25:58.210
<v Speaker 3>herpes and they've transferred it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the rabbi has to suck the kids.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Dick stop the bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1958
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.570
<v Speaker 3>They still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1959
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still do that and they still defend</v>

1960
01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a traditional way of doing it and</v>

1961
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you're giving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herpes.</v>

1962
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 3>People have given the baby's herpes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids have died from it.</v>

1963
01:26:11.961 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1964
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 3>they've died from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1965
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:20.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still gone down to they suck the baby</v>

1966
01:26:20.331 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 3>penis and there's a fucking video of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one rabbi explaining the necessity</v>

1967
01:26:25.251 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>of doing this because it's the part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient book.</v>

1968
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:29.300
<v Speaker 3>It's in the Torah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it is.</v>

1969
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Robert Baker estimates 229 deaths per</v>
<v Speaker 3>year from circumcision in the United</v>

1970
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:36.550
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ballinger estimates that approximately</v>

1971
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.560
<v Speaker 3>119 infant boys die from circumcision</v>
<v Speaker 3>related each year in the U.</v>

1972
01:26:42.061 --> 01:26:47.061
<v Speaker 3>s one point three percent of all male</v>
<v Speaker 3>neonatal deaths from all causes are from</v>

1973
01:26:48.801 --> 01:26:49.970
<v Speaker 3>circumcision.</v>

1974
01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.130
<v Speaker 3>These are several cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are several case reports of death</v>

1975
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.820
<v Speaker 3>in the medical literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1976
01:26:58.090 --> 01:27:01.710
<v Speaker 3>people die all the time from</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumcision or just understand that</v>

1977
01:27:01.711 --> 01:27:05.460
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an elected unnecessary surgery</v>

1978
01:27:05.461 --> 01:27:09.600
<v Speaker 3>that you're doing to a fucking baby and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no medical reason to do it,</v>

1979
01:27:09.601 --> 01:27:10.690
<v Speaker 3>but oh well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1980
01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:13.590
<v Speaker 3>it's prevents people say stupid shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1981
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:14.790
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1982
01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:17.040
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1983
01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to justify the fact they've done it</v>

1984
01:27:19.831 --> 01:27:21.720
<v Speaker 3>forever and try to come up with wool</v>
<v Speaker 3>hygiene.</v>

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Wash your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you dirty bitch soap and water.</v>

1986
01:27:24.691 --> 01:27:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Wash your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a guy at the gym one time as</v>

1987
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.290
<v Speaker 3>the old Dube stood underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the hand dryers?</v>

1989
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he rolled his circumcised dick down to</v>

1990
01:27:34.561 --> 01:27:37.400
<v Speaker 3>dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never used that edge right here to</v>

1991
01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.070
<v Speaker 3>get out.</v>

1992
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:40.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking there move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1993
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:42.160
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1994
01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't have any shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1995
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if those numbers are</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate that you just read or that we</v>

1996
01:27:47.101 --> 01:27:50.090
<v Speaker 3>just pulled up on another article</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about it and this is an</v>

1997
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Australian link to talk about the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that says that by or</v>

1998
01:27:55.890 --> 01:27:59.940
<v Speaker 3>according to this study that not all</v>
<v Speaker 3>deaths that might be circumstantial,</v>

1999
01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.880
<v Speaker 3>unrelated are officially recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2000
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:04.740
<v Speaker 3>there might be more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they hide it.</v>

2001
01:28:04.741 --> 01:28:07.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess they call it something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it's an infection or something</v>

2002
01:28:07.531 --> 01:28:08.364
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2003
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:10.230
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unnecessary.</v>

2004
01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.490
<v Speaker 3>It's barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to look back on this 100</v>

2005
01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:15.080
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 years from now and they're gonna</v>

2006
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 3>make fun of it the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make fun of powder wigs,</v>

2007
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:19.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's even worse because you do want</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to babies,</v>

2008
01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:20.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies can eat,</v>

2009
01:28:20.271 --> 01:28:22.470
<v Speaker 3>didn't have any of you say by the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're adults.</v>

2010
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:23.420
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to my Dick?</v>

2011
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we just thought it was ugly.</v>

2012
01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.070
<v Speaker 3>We had you cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut.</v>

2013
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would.</v>

2014
01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.220
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2015
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:33.110
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a decision a person should be</v>

2016
01:28:33.111 --> 01:28:36.350
<v Speaker 3>able to make because I feel like every</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy at the age where they were old</v>

2017
01:28:36.351 --> 01:28:37.630
<v Speaker 3>enough to make that would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2018
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:39.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>

2019
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you just know that some guys are</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to grow their circumstance?</v>

2020
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Their forced back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:48.560
<v Speaker 3>This is what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're taking the skin that they have</v>

2022
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 3>the regular skin around their dick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stretching it out and there's</v>

2023
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:55.210
<v Speaker 3>all these devices like the lip poll and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poll shit.</v>

2024
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:58.960
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get it to go back so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've taken like the base of their,</v>

2025
01:28:58.961 --> 01:29:03.130
<v Speaker 3>their Dick where it was cut and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling skin up a little bit every day.</v>

2026
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding that this like devices</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have,</v>

2027
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:18.380
<v Speaker 3>you pull your pants pull before</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they believe by when they can really</v>

2028
01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 3>pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll reattach and grow.</v>

2029
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:24.511
<v Speaker 3>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks weird.</v>

2030
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:27.180
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a turtle neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never really looked like.</v>

2031
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a single layer of skin.</v>

2032
01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:31.600
<v Speaker 3>At the top you've got a double layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's gotTa.</v>

2033
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:34.620
<v Speaker 3>You gotta rolled layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do have skin at the top,</v>

2034
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:36.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.370
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a blanket.</v>

2036
01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:40.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2037
01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.260
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get.</v>

2038
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't get over people doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess people do every day.</v>

2039
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Why am I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a whole community of people</v>

2040
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:49.410
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to grow their force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back,</v>

2041
01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.440
<v Speaker 3>they're really angry and they feel all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pain and emotional pain from the</v>

2042
01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:58.170
<v Speaker 3>fact they cut their dick cut when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a little baby and they had no</v>

2043
01:29:58.171 --> 01:30:02.280
<v Speaker 3>say in it and apparently it makes your</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Dick less sensitive when you do</v>

2044
01:30:02.281 --> 01:30:06.300
<v Speaker 3>that and your Dick is naturally self</v>
<v Speaker 3>lubricating the head of your Dick is,</v>

2045
01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:10.520
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as they cut the skin off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it dries out and you know,</v>

2046
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:11.600
<v Speaker 3>we're used to dry dick.</v>

2047
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

2048
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 3>I got plenty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apparently regular discs,</v>

2049
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.810
<v Speaker 3>if you don't cut them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're moist.</v>

2050
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.320
<v Speaker 3>The tip like you pull that force came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and that tip has got like a layer</v>

2051
01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 3>of mucus on which is why you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean it and cut it off.</v>

2052
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was man.</v>

2053
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird practice,</v>

2054
01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:32.294
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>

2055
01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that it's still around in this</v>

2056
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.930
<v Speaker 3>day and age with all that we know and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the risks that we know about where</v>

2057
01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:42.390
<v Speaker 3>kids actually do get sick and die from</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2058
01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.970
<v Speaker 3>That's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens every year.</v>

2059
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many people are out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have fucked up dicks that had just</v>

2060
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:53.990

<v Speaker 3>ancient tradition that we passed on.</v>

2061

01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:11.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing I didn't know was still</v>

2099
01:32:11.321 --> 01:32:12.190
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously,</v>

2100
01:32:12.191 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 1>do they circumcised babies still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know that.</v>

2101
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Do they defend it and said it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Jew tradition.</v>

2102
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he got his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when couldn't use</v>

2103
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.850
<v Speaker 6>because it was hard.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They were keeping the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was deep in the game.</v>

2106
01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Are already went to Israel and lived on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a blitz or something like that.</v>

2108
01:32:30.761 --> 01:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>One of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in one of those colonies where</v>

2109
01:32:33.971 --> 01:32:34.451
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2110
01:32:34.451 --> 01:32:37.270
<v Speaker 3>you're reading the Torah like fucking 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day</v>

2111
01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.630
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talked to me about that.</v>

2112
01:32:39.631 --> 01:32:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And you and it's a funded trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay nothing to go do that.</v>

2113
01:32:42.721 --> 01:32:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It's your um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2114
01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it not right of passage or maybe</v>

2115
01:32:47.791 --> 01:32:48.541
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2116
01:32:48.541 --> 01:32:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's paid for if you want to</v>

2117
01:32:52.201 --> 01:32:53.850
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was telling us how he went there.</v>

2118
01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy because he went</v>

2119
01:32:56.370 --> 01:33:01.370
<v Speaker 1>the other way like they did and they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>him over there and after like he just</v>

2120
01:33:02.161 --> 01:33:03.240
<v Speaker 1>experienced it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2121
01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:04.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all horseshit.</v>

2122
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:06.030
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

2123

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:33:10.691 --> 01:33:12.700

<v Speaker 1>You had the crazy braids.</v>

2125
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:14.430
<v Speaker 1>He went to Kennis and route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2126
01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.100
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the head injury,</v>

2127
01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:20.500
<v Speaker 1>no kid isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that shit came from digital that,</v>

2128
01:33:20.501 --> 01:33:22.750
<v Speaker 1>that all came from a head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

2129
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Kinisons book?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother bill or um,</v>

2130
01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:29.160
<v Speaker 3>my brother Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2131
01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:34.020
<v Speaker 3>his brother Bill wrote a book about him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said that Sam was one way and it</v>

2132
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:35.280
<v Speaker 3>like a normal kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2133
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:36.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calm,</v>

2134
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.980
<v Speaker 3>regular kid and he got hit by a car and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he got hit by a car he was like,</v>

2135
01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:44.700
<v Speaker 3>like seriously injured bad head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then out of that he was a wild</v>

2136
01:33:44.701 --> 01:33:45.530
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

2137
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all changed.</v>

2138
01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.280
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People head injuries.</v>

2139
01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2140
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I had a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she passed away when she was 16 and I</v>

2141
01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.760
<v Speaker 1>was talking to the doctor at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget,</v>

2142
01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:59.870
<v Speaker 1>he said this about the soul and you knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just having this conversation.</v>

2143
01:33:59.871 --> 01:34:01.700
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe the souls in the brain.</v>

2144
01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.601
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2145
01:34:02.601 --> 01:34:03.041
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2146
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Everyone associates the soul with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chest and the heart and the soul and the</v>

2147
01:34:06.801 --> 01:34:07.551
<v Speaker 1>heart and soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2148
01:34:07.551 --> 01:34:12.020
<v Speaker 1>but I can literally replace anything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and you're still Joe Rogan,</v>

2149
01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.500
<v Speaker 1>but the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment I even tweak your brain,</v>

2150
01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you can become a different Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2151
01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.480
<v Speaker 1>that's why I believe the true soul is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

2152
01:34:20.481 --> 01:34:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really fucking interesting</v>

2153
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:26.300
<v Speaker 1>because you can't manipulate a brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

2154
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:29.690
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you start changing even a little</v>

2155
01:34:29.691 --> 01:34:32.200
<v Speaker 1>thing on a brain and it can be like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

2156
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:34.430
<v Speaker 1>become a wild man from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the other way.</v>

2157
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.250
<v Speaker 3>You remember when you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had tvs that weren't that good back</v>

2158
01:34:38.251 --> 01:34:42.760
<v Speaker 3>then in like the TV didn't work good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd fucking smacked that bitch.</v>

2159
01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:44.870
<v Speaker 6>It would work.</v>

2160
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:49.240
<v Speaker 3>There</v>
<v Speaker 3>was something with people.</v>

2161
01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Some people you just fucking rattle</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cage and they become a different</v>

2162
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 3>thing and it works better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a very inexact,</v>

2163
01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>like people had gotten hit in the head</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden been able to play</v>

2164
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:01.790
<v Speaker 3>music and got really good at math.</v>

2165
01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2166
01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:06.480
<v Speaker 4>So Gora talks about that on his special</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a head injury and comes back with,</v>

2167
01:35:07.650 --> 01:35:09.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it tourette's or something?</v>

2168
01:35:09.691 --> 01:35:12.180
<v Speaker 4>They come back different yet accent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

2169
01:35:12.181 --> 01:35:14.480
<v Speaker 4>An accident or sudden accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2170
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.290
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really cool.</v>

2171
01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2172
01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Head injuries there.</v>

2173
01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Dome is a weird thing,</v>

2174
01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:25.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the weird fucking shit going on</v>

2175
01:35:25.441 --> 01:35:29.730
<v Speaker 3>up there and all the different synapses</v>
<v Speaker 3>and neurons firing and one little,</v>

2176
01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:33.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock the somebody throws at you boxing</v>

2177
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:35.880
<v Speaker 3>the side of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a different person.</v>

2178
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forever.</v>

2179
01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so many stories about</v>

2180
01:35:39.481 --> 01:35:43.080
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to so many doctors and</v>

2181
01:35:43.110 --> 01:35:45.630
<v Speaker 3>neurologists that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2182
01:35:45.631 --> 01:35:48.900
<v Speaker 3>they study the human brain and it's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most perplexing things is like</v>

2183
01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you can get the same two people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one person gets hit the same way,</v>

2184
01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:56.790
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens and the other person is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different human being for the rest of</v>

2185
01:35:56.791 --> 01:35:59.130
<v Speaker 3>their life and they'll struggle with</v>

<v Speaker 11>I thought she was joking with me,</v>

2239
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:42.090
<v Speaker 11>but then she showed me that the doctor</v>
<v Speaker 11>had told her she was diagnosed with</v>

2240
01:38:42.091 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 11>foreign accent syndrome and she searched</v>
<v Speaker 11>it and then I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem with that.</v>

2245
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I can talk like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that I talked like this,</v>

2246
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:56.580
<v Speaker 3>so if I come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if I got an operation,</v>

<v Speaker 3>back and I started talking like this,</v>

2257
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they still possess the</v>
<v Speaker 3>original accent as well or is it just</v>

2258
01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:29.310

<v Speaker 10>So 2006.</v>

2268
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.210
<v Speaker 10>She was suffering from bad health for a</v>
<v Speaker 10>little while.</v>

2269
01:40:01.211 --> 01:40:06.211
<v Speaker 10>You'd had headaches and then you spoke</v>
<v Speaker 10>to your sister on the phone and noticed</v>

2270
01:40:06.791 --> 01:40:07.910
<v Speaker 10>that your voice was changing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

2271
01:40:07.911 --> 01:40:10.640
<v Speaker 10>I started off with just the least and</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

2272
01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:13.330
<v Speaker 10>I was a good concern.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I am with ill health.</v>

2273
01:40:13.331 --> 01:40:16.370
<v Speaker 10>I tend to get over fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I fought it to start.</v>

2274
01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:20.080
<v Speaker 10>So Dutch still there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The next wounding solely.</v>

2275
01:40:20.081 --> 01:40:22.090

<v Speaker 10>strange.</v>

2276
01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.380
<v Speaker 10>I run a stock on trends.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My role rose up there.</v>

2277
01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:29.950
<v Speaker 10>Left at that time I could speak.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I record a message.</v>

2278
01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.390
<v Speaker 10>Nobody back.</v>

<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>nothing to worry.</v>

2280
01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:38.350

<v Speaker 10>like an alien by first year to go and</v>

2281
01:40:38.351 --> 01:40:41.140
<v Speaker 10>completely and then I lost my swallow at</v>
<v Speaker 10>the same time,</v>

2282
01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.530
<v Speaker 10>which that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So scary for my family.</v>

2283
01:40:44.531 --> 01:40:47.390
<v Speaker 10>They were still terrified for me,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but we'll stop.</v>

2284
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:48.263
<v Speaker 10>Stuck me in.</v>

2285
01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Why are they scared?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you talking weird or because you</v>

<v Speaker 3>you don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one can call people crazy anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Ken are people that really believe that</v>

2339
01:43:44.551 --> 01:43:47.790
<v Speaker 3>they're in the wrong life form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they should have been born at Fox,</v>

2340
01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:50.100
<v Speaker 3>specifically fox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them foxes.</v>

2341
01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:50.963
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

2344
01:43:57.650 --> 01:44:01.250
<v Speaker 3>This is where it gets real tricky</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think there's people that are</v>

2345
01:44:01.251 --> 01:44:04.340
<v Speaker 3>legitimately transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were born in the wrong body.</v>

2349
01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.910

2350
01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy and they just decide that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should have been born a woman or a</v>

2351
01:44:15.351 --> 01:44:17.990
<v Speaker 3>man or they go back and forth it.</v>

2394
01:46:10.101 --> 01:46:12.260
<v Speaker 2>times when he's off looking over here</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

2398
01:46:25.911 --> 01:46:29.360
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well at night when I'm home alone,</v>

2399
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 2>the doctors come in through my window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drop liquid acid in my ears and</v>

2400
01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:36.980
<v Speaker 2>they knocked me out and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>started taking samples of my body and</v>

2401
01:46:36.981 --> 01:46:40.490
<v Speaker 2>after they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the love of my life comes and I can't</v>

2402
01:46:40.491 --> 01:46:44.150
<v Speaker 2>communicate with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is how I communicate with,</v>

2403
01:46:44.151 --> 01:46:46.820
<v Speaker 2>are these are there for when she comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in to speak for me.</v>

2404
01:46:46.821 --> 01:46:47.654
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:25.460
<v Speaker 3>It basically is when people are around</v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia looks for too long.</v>

2416
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 3>They develop schizophrenia themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2417
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some people who are sympathetic</v>

2418
01:47:31.621 --> 01:47:33.120
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where,</v>

2419
01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say,</v>

2420
01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.840
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's called Allah phrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a some sort of a disease that</v>

2421
01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:45.110
<v Speaker 3>occasionally infects people or gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that visit people in the hospital</v>

2422
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.140
<v Speaker 3>that are schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so someone will come,</v>

2423
01:47:49.141 --> 01:47:54.141
<v Speaker 3>like family member will come visit you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they will get diagnosed and they</v>

2424
01:47:54.631 --> 01:47:59.220
<v Speaker 3>will get admitted themselves and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll actually get it.</v>

2425
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know to what stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it isn't.</v>

2426
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a potential issue for some people</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like,</v>

2427
01:48:06.751 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever been hypnotized?</v>

2428
01:48:10.410 --> 01:48:13.380
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was horse shit to my friend</v>

2429
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Vinny shoreman who is a sports</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotists worse with a lot of fighters.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He hypnotized me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2431
01:48:17.971 --> 01:48:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is real.</v>

2432
01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.230
<v Speaker 3>It just puts you in a very bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>staff.</v>

2433
01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Feel that date.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're awake,</v>

2435
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.920
<v Speaker 3>you're conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're in a strange state.</v>

2436
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:27.370
<v Speaker 3>It's almost feel something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:48:27.371 --> 01:48:28.220
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2438
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.000
<v Speaker 3>like you're in a tube of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like you're in a womb.</v>

2439
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:34.470
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting,</v>

2440
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:37.680
<v Speaker 3>but I'm listening to him and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>

2441
01:48:37.681 --> 01:48:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

2442
01:48:38.851 --> 01:48:40.590

2445
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was Kinda skeptical.</v>

2446
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.473
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is horse shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>guy in Boston and in Rhode Island and he</v>

2452
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:02.610

<v Speaker 3>stage and he would just be able to take</v>

<v Speaker 3>it wasn't real.</v>

2488

2493
01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>would know who was under who wasn't</v>

2495
01:50:29.961 --> 01:50:32.120
<v Speaker 3>under this guy was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would work with people who were</v>

2496
01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:34.560
<v Speaker 3>trying to quit smoking and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit gambling.</v>

2497
01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:37.950
<v Speaker 3>A friend that did the smoking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling booze.</v>

2498
01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:40.680
<v Speaker 3>They can apparently they can do it with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different things with him,</v>

2499
01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.910
<v Speaker 3>but smoking is a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

2500
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:46.010
<v Speaker 3>he just could do it to some people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you quick,</v>

2501
01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.710
<v Speaker 3>he would do it and there's fucking 300</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the room,</v>

2502
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:50.840
<v Speaker 3>but he would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to cut my fingers from the</v>

2503
01:50:50.841 --> 01:50:52.850
<v Speaker 3>count of three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the car and the police are</v>

2504
01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:53.780
<v Speaker 3>chasing you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2505
01:50:53.781 --> 01:50:54.590
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

2506
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:57.080
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the car and the cops are chasing</v>

2507
01:50:57.081 --> 01:50:59.440
<v Speaker 3>me and it was just instant man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was.</v>

2508
01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.580
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>

2509
01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:05.330
<v Speaker 3>they just fall into these states of mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're open to suggestion.</v>

2510
01:51:05.331 --> 01:51:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Some people can be hypnotized and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is why some people I think join cults,</v>

2511
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:12.380
<v Speaker 3>like I'm watching this new netflix</v>
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

2512
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:16.670
<v Speaker 3>wild wild country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck crazy.</v>

2513
01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:21.890
<v Speaker 3>But some people I think are more</v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to suggestion and more</v>

2514
01:51:21.891 --> 01:51:24.890
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to colds and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2515
01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.360
<v Speaker 3>that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's happening with</v>

2516
01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:29.750
<v Speaker 3>this Allah phrenia thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's what it's called,</v>

2517
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be remembering that incorrectly,</v>

2518
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that you've been around a</v>

2519
01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:38.440
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever weird error,</v>

2520
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:42.440
<v Speaker 3>their brain is making your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain tunes into that error and you</v>

2521
01:51:42.441 --> 01:51:43.460
<v Speaker 3>start going crazy too.</v>

2522
01:51:43.590 --> 01:51:46.260
<v Speaker 2>As soon as that shit made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2523
01:51:46.261 --> 01:51:48.810
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get the fuck out of here because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done.</v>

2524
01:51:50.130 --> 01:51:53.310
<v Speaker 2>He's harmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never heard anyone but he still,</v>

2525
01:51:53.311 --> 01:51:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these days he's white.</v>

2526
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:57.990
<v Speaker 2>He's pro guys probably in his sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in any kind of shape,</v>

2527
01:51:57.991 --> 01:52:00.390
<v Speaker 2>but back then when he still knew of</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>

2528
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:04.890
<v Speaker 2>he was dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never hurt anybody but he knew</v>

2529
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:09.720
<v Speaker 2>how to and so one day there's eastern</v>
<v Speaker 2>avenue in Baltimore's,</v>

2530
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:13.530
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ventura Boulevard of Baltimore shops</v>

2531
01:52:13.531 --> 01:52:16.230
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was this one woman that had</v>

2532
01:52:16.231 --> 01:52:21.231
<v Speaker 2>cut his hair one time and for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me to touch his head,</v>

2533
01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.980
<v Speaker 2>was a big deal for him this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he immediately fell in love with this</v>

2534
01:52:25.981 --> 01:52:27.810
<v Speaker 2>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her name was Clarissa.</v>

2535
01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:32.520
<v Speaker 2>So he went home and got his guitar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about this guitar,</v>

2536
01:52:32.521 --> 01:52:35.370
<v Speaker 2>like this dude would pawn his bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his guitar,</v>

2537
01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.233
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2538
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:41.270
<v Speaker 2>But that guitar was always out of tune</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same way.</v>

2539
01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

2540
01:52:43.141 --> 01:52:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So always fucked up,</v>

2541
01:52:44.761 --> 01:52:47.300
<v Speaker 2>but always consistently fucked up every</v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar he had.</v>

2542
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:49.340
<v Speaker 2>That's how he tuned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how he heard it.</v>

2543
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he writes her that he writes her a</v>

2544
01:52:53.991 --> 01:52:57.980
<v Speaker 2>love song and he wants to go up to her</v>
<v Speaker 2>shop and now sing it for her.</v>

2545
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So he goes up and he stands out in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the shop and he's gets her attention.</v>

2546
01:53:04.461 --> 01:53:07.220
<v Speaker 2>He's got his guitar and he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts off where he goes.</v>

2547
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:08.061
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

2548
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I love you in Baltimore accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her name's Clarissa.</v>

2549
01:53:10.971 --> 01:53:11.870
<v Speaker 2>But he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

2550
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you Chris.</v>

2551
01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I need you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he goes,</v>

2552
01:53:16.071 --> 01:53:17.280
<v Speaker 2>chrystal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daggers of Christian,</v>

2553
01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:20.030
<v Speaker 2>all crack because I want to crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's freaking out like,</v>

2554
01:53:20.031 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2555
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:21.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your eyes.</v>

2556
01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 2>So they call the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets arrested.</v>

2557
01:53:26.190 --> 01:53:29.000
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't understand why he's arrested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his mind.</v>

2558
01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.940
<v Speaker 2>What did I do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote a beautiful song for</v>

2559
01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:33.860
<v Speaker 2>someone I care about and I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>share it with her.</v>

2560
01:53:33.861 --> 01:53:36.200
<v Speaker 2>So my cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us were like,</v>

2561
01:53:36.201 --> 01:53:39.480
<v Speaker 2>we gotta go to court and watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to offend because he's</v>

2562
01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:42.370
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to go to court.</v>

2563
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:46.470
<v Speaker 2>So they bring them out from the back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stands up and it's a,</v>

2564
01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:48.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a female judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she's my great aunt.</v>

2567
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:54.650
<v Speaker 2>My grandma's sister buys extended family</v>
<v Speaker 2>big time and we're all there watching.</v>

2568
01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And the judge says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask the girl her side of things.</v>

2569
01:53:58.190 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this happened and he's like,</v>

2571
01:54:02.091 --> 01:54:03.860
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand what I did</v>

2572
01:54:03.861 --> 01:54:04.220
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

2573
01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a song for someone I care about</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wanted to share it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>would you mind sharing some of the</v>

<v Speaker 2>because they understand I'm going to put</v>

2604
01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Jesus really did drop the charges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a clerical error that</v>

<v Speaker 2>never made it to the paperwork.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they were pulling it back and he was</v>

2608

<v Speaker 2>me that nurses would give him head in</v>

2611
01:55:31.191 --> 01:55:33.340
<v Speaker 2>the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2613
01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:41.200

<v Speaker 2>he had this scab on his stomach and he</v>

2614
01:55:42.171 --> 01:55:44.640
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they coming in and cut me and tested me</v>

2615

<v Speaker 2>I think I got something.</v>

2617
01:55:48.571 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I think I got a disease and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cut.</v>

2618
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

2619
01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a plan.</v>

2620
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:55.670
<v Speaker 4>So I talked to him later that day and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

2621
01:55:55.671 --> 01:55:57.500
<v Speaker 4>what did you do about that disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

2622
01:55:57.501 --> 01:55:58.880
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I did with that scab?</v>

2623
01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I picked it off and throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought the scab</v>

2624
01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:07.100
<v Speaker 4>and you can just flick it away and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2625
01:56:07.101 --> 01:56:12.101
<v Speaker 4>that shit's gone.</v>

01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gave him like we all had to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to say Tiki.</v>

2643
01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.673
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would.</v>

2644
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:02.440
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>

2645
01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.480
<v Speaker 2>He smokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would come to my grandma's house.</v>

2646
01:57:04.481 --> 01:57:08.350
<v Speaker 2>When I live with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd sit in a chair and he smoked</v>

2647
01:57:08.351 --> 01:57:09.490
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2648
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:12.940
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't put any farther away than</v>
<v Speaker 2>three by three inches from his mouth and</v>

2649
01:57:12.941 --> 01:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>not just down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Done,</v>

2650
01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:14.951
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

2651
01:57:14.951 --> 01:57:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And he'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll go through three packs.</v>

2652
01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:19.240
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom died of breast cancer and she</v>

2653
01:57:19.241 --> 01:57:21.080
<v Speaker 2>would say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he even has a fucking</v>

2654
01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.980
<v Speaker 2>throat left and I'm dying of cancer over</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and he is.</v>

2655
01:57:23.981 --> 01:57:26.080
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still alive.</v>

2656
01:57:26.081 --> 01:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Smoking cigarettes like that to still</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking cigarettes or a carton in three</v>

2657
01:57:30.851 --> 01:57:31.870
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does a carton?</v>

2658
01:57:32.110 --> 01:57:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty packs.</v>

2659
01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:36.240
<v Speaker 2>That's roughly seven packs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like</v>

2660
01:57:37.090 --> 01:57:39.400
<v Speaker 4>a day for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For decades.</v>

2661
01:57:39.850 --> 01:57:44.570
<v Speaker 4>For decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2662
01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:47.060
<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2663
01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:48.850
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember what he was like before?</v>

2664
01:57:48.851 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2665
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Phrenic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't because when I was a kid he was</v>

2666
01:57:52.591 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 2>already gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my dad loved them and would bring</v>

2667
01:57:55.081 --> 01:57:56.610
<v Speaker 2>them out to the house because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>

2668
01:57:56.611 --> 01:57:58.920
<v Speaker 2>He was just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would say shit and he'd be like,</v>

2669
01:57:58.921 --> 01:58:00.270
<v Speaker 2>don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give them a break.</v>

2670
01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget to write and be nice.</v>

2671
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Don't give them a bug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Brit.</v>

2672
01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:06.930
<v Speaker 2>But my dad will tell me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a phenomenal athlete.</v>

2673
01:58:06.931 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great at karate.</v>

2674
01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:10.920
<v Speaker 2>He had a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was cross.</v>

2675
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a sweat.</v>

2676
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:15.630
<v Speaker 2>He tried to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so highland town is the area where,</v>

2677
01:58:15.631 --> 01:58:17.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my aunt never,</v>

2678
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:19.590
<v Speaker 2>this is the old Greek town in Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2679
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:20.483
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2680
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Greek as long gone in that neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's where he grew up and he would</v>

2681
01:58:23.461 --> 01:58:27.150
<v Speaker 2>try to tell me that highland town was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Haight Ashbury in Baltimore.</v>

2682
01:58:27.151 --> 01:58:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here with that</v>

2683
01:58:28.681 --> 01:58:30.480
<v Speaker 2>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was doing acid,</v>

2684
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 11.</v>

2685
01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And he dabble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said that early and then</v>

2686
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:41.170
<v Speaker 2>eventually after like into the college</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2687
01:58:41.171 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 2>the twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really</v>

2688
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.090
<v Speaker 3>fucking ramped it up and he was almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

2689
01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:50.500
<v Speaker 3>He made himself crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The common story is people that have a</v>

2690
01:58:50.501 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 3>tendency to schizophrenia or they may be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the likelihood of developing it later in</v>

2691
01:58:55.271 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acid trips,</v>

2692
01:58:57.190 --> 01:58:58.630
<v Speaker 3>mushroom trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy.</v>

2693
01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:01.090
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics tend to bring out</v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>

2694
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 3>They tend to make it manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe he was ripe for it because</v>

2695
01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 3>there's no other mental illness in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

2696
01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just him.</v>

2697
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2698
01:59:11.951 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I think especially when you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2699
01:59:14.411 --> 01:59:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about how many people have had</v>

2700
01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:19.630
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible acid trips just taken way too</v>

2701
01:59:19.631 --> 01:59:24.370
<v Speaker 3>much and tried to fight it and just been</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up for days and weeks and then</v>

2702
01:59:24.371 --> 01:59:27.640
<v Speaker 3>you still feel slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You life feels weird.</v>

2703
01:59:27.641 --> 01:59:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Even after those trips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a DMT trip one time that fucked me</v>

2704
01:59:31.661 --> 01:59:34.660
<v Speaker 3>up for a couple weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for a couple of weeks afterwards</v>

2705
01:59:34.661 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 3>I'd be driving my car to be thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a car.</v>

2706
01:59:37.130 --> 01:59:41.470
<v Speaker 3>It's going to launch itself off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking the the oncoming lane and fly</v>

2707
01:59:41.471 --> 01:59:43.720
<v Speaker 3>right into me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking I had this image that was</v>

2708
01:59:43.721 --> 01:59:45.280
<v Speaker 3>going to be upside down in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

2709
01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 3>The car was going to hit the windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying upside down and down and just</v>

2710
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:51.850
<v Speaker 3>slammed for weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

2711
01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:54.430
<v Speaker 3>weeks afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm scared of that shit.</v>

2712
01:59:54.450 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 3>It's because I tried to think about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>was possibly happening.</v>

2713
01:59:58.301 --> 02:00:03.301
<v Speaker 3>I think it dissolved my ego so much and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made me think so much about how</v>

2714
02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:11.460
<v Speaker 3>relatively unimportant every single</v>
<v Speaker 3>person is in terms of the greater scheme</v>

2715
02:00:12.521 --> 02:00:17.521
<v Speaker 3>of the universe that whatever it did to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me had broke down all my conceptions of</v>

2716
02:00:18.941 --> 02:00:21.760
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my preconceived notions of myself so</v>

2717
02:00:21.761 --> 02:00:26.761
<v Speaker 3>much that my ego was freaking out so it</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to invent danger,</v>

2718
02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 3>so I would have to be more primal to</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend myself again,</v>

2719
02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 3>look out and look out over there.</v>

2720
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:33.370
<v Speaker 3>There's danger instead of me going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2721
02:00:33.371 --> 02:00:35.110
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

2722
02:00:35.111 --> 02:00:37.810
<v Speaker 3>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the energy that courses through</v>

2723
02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:39.610
<v Speaker 3>your body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the purpose of the human race?</v>

2724
02:00:39.611 --> 02:00:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we moving towards?</v>

2725
02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Why are we so committed to innovation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and technology?</v>

2726
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I all these crazy thoughts where I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out what the purpose of</v>

2727
02:00:48.570 --> 02:00:53.500
<v Speaker 3>the activities of the human race war</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was so bizarrely different than</v>

2728
02:00:53.501 --> 02:00:57.070
<v Speaker 3>my normal pattern of thought that my</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind just started coming up with all</v>

2729
02:00:57.071 --> 02:00:59.980
<v Speaker 3>sorts of weird paranoid ideas with</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2730
02:01:00.230 --> 02:01:03.700
<v Speaker 3>It took me like two weeks before a</v>
<v Speaker 3>normalized and after two weeks I felt</v>

2731
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:06.520
<v Speaker 3>nora and I didn't do dmt again for years</v>
<v Speaker 3>after that.</v>

2732
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:09.100
<v Speaker 3>So here's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedians have come on and talked about</v>

2733
02:01:09.110 --> 02:01:10.510
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

2734
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Is it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously asking you because I'm</v>

2735
02:01:13.301 --> 02:01:15.580
<v Speaker 3>ignorant is DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the chemical?</v>

2736
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Your body releases as you die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body releases you die,</v>

2737
02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that your body makes it.</v>

2738
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 3>They know that your liver makes in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>lungs,</v>

2739
02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:27.280
<v Speaker 3>make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they think that your pineal gland</v>

2740
02:01:27.281 --> 02:01:30.190
<v Speaker 3>makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is your third eye and reptiles</v>

2741
02:01:30.191 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 3>that actually has a retina and a lens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2742
02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2743
02:01:33.551 --> 02:01:36.280
<v Speaker 3>The pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sits in the center of your brain</v>

2744
02:01:36.281 --> 02:01:39.470
<v Speaker 3>literally die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at like a third and the</v>

2745
02:01:39.471 --> 02:01:41.870
<v Speaker 3>eastern mysticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the pineal gland is,</v>

2746
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:45.830
<v Speaker 3>and now they know that rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they're alive,</v>

2747
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 3>produced dmt and the pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a new study that was done.</v>

2748
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I think this research was published over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last five or six years,</v>

2749
02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:59.150
<v Speaker 3>so because of the fact that they know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now they're assuming that human</v>

2750
02:01:59.151 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 3>beings also produce in the pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would,</v>

2751
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of sort of verifies what</v>

2752
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:08.510
<v Speaker 3>everybody always thought the pineal</v>
<v Speaker 3>gland as they thought they would call</v>

2753
02:02:08.511 --> 02:02:09.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seed of the soul,</v>

2754
02:02:10.030 --> 02:02:14.120
<v Speaker 3>that this is where your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your journey to the afterlife begins and</v>

2755
02:02:14.121 --> 02:02:18.140
<v Speaker 3>the pineal gland and that this chemical</v>
<v Speaker 3>gateway opens up and your soul passes</v>

2756
02:02:18.141 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 3>through to the great beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it can it be like a bad trip on the</v>

2757
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:23.234
<v Speaker 3>way out?</v>

2758
02:02:23.650 --> 02:02:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2759
02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:25.503
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met.</v>

2760
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:28.040
<v Speaker 3>I've been with people who've had bad dmt</v>
<v Speaker 3>trips.</v>

2761
02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I was his stan hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got stan hope high on DMT and I</v>

2762
02:02:32.331 --> 02:02:33.770
<v Speaker 3>thought he was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at,</v>

2763
02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:36.560
<v Speaker 3>he's at my house and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's moaning and foaming at the mouth.</v>

2764
02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:38.260
<v Speaker 3>He's like raw.</v>

2765
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:42.620
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen anybody do that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd see a bunch of people.</v>

2766
02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Most people smoke dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do this,</v>

2767
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:46.730
<v Speaker 3>they smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they just go.</v>

2768
02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:52.850
<v Speaker 3>They lay back and then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this overwhelming experience happens to</v>

2769
02:02:52.851 --> 02:02:56.060
<v Speaker 3>them for like 15 minutes and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back to it and then they come back.</v>

2770
02:02:56.061 --> 02:02:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't move.</v>

2771
02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:58.730
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not ours.</v>

2772
02:02:58.780 --> 02:02:59.421
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2773
02:02:59.421 --> 02:03:00.800
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a quick experience.</v>

2774
02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca is an orally active experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Dmt,</v>

2775
02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:09.710
<v Speaker 3>with Iowasca is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tried to eat dmt,</v>

2776
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:14.090
<v Speaker 3>dmt is broken down in your gut by</v>
<v Speaker 3>something called Mano Aiming Oxidase.</v>

2777
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:18.290
<v Speaker 3>So when they make Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they take part of one</v>

2778
02:03:18.291 --> 02:03:21.950
<v Speaker 3>plant which has dimethyltryptamine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of another plant which has</v>

2779
02:03:21.951 --> 02:03:24.380
<v Speaker 3>something called harming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a dmp.</v>

2780
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:28.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a mano aiming oxidase inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2781
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.990
<v Speaker 3>Mao inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some and medications and the sub</v>

2782
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.770
<v Speaker 3>is a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you gotta be very careful if you're</v>

2783
02:03:33.771 --> 02:03:37.670
<v Speaker 3>taking mushrooms or something else that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you not taking Mao inhibitors as well.</v>

2784
02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:41.330
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you take this stuff together and what</v>

2785
02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:43.880
<v Speaker 3>it does is it gives you an orally active</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt trip.</v>

2786
02:03:43.881 --> 02:03:48.090
<v Speaker 3>So as it's broken down by your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a slow release dmt trip that</v>

2787
02:03:48.091 --> 02:03:53.091
<v Speaker 3>will take several hours as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking rocket ship ride to the</v>

2788
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:55.640
<v Speaker 3>center of the universe that you get when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take it,</v>

2789
02:03:55.641 --> 02:03:58.430
<v Speaker 3>when you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you smoke it or intravenous</v>

2790
02:03:58.431 --> 02:04:00.330
<v Speaker 3>use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to a doctor and knows how to</v>

2791
02:04:00.331 --> 02:04:03.060
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes directly into your bloodstream</v>

2792
02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:06.410
<v Speaker 3>and it's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is impossible to avoid.</v>

2793
02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.210
<v Speaker 3>You cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't hang on,</v>

2794
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to take you to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>center of the universe and you're going</v>

2795
02:04:11.991 --> 02:04:16.991
<v Speaker 3>to experience life forms and interaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>with spirits and angels and aliens and</v>

2796
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:18.740
<v Speaker 3>gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

2797
02:04:18.741 --> 02:04:20.930
<v Speaker 3>it was a bunch of gestures that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving me the finger.</v>

2798
02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:24.830
<v Speaker 3>It was rate giving me the finger like</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

2799
02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Like it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2800
02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:28.550
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful.</v>

2801
02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that Stan hope one was the only time</v>

2802
02:04:31.131 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I ever saw someone who I thought they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were going to die.</v>

2803
02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I killed one of my best friends?</v>

2804
02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:36.291
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have I killed?</v>

2805
02:04:36.291 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope I get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2806
02:04:39.370 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I did it first because I think</v>

2807
02:04:41.851 --> 02:04:42.840
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hadn't done it before,</v>

2808
02:04:42.841 --> 02:04:43.531
<v Speaker 3>so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

2809
02:04:43.531 --> 02:04:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Just watch me do it and just sit down</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and then you do it next.</v>

2810
02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:47.820
<v Speaker 3>So I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone.</v>

2811

<v Speaker 3>Fifteen minutes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're ready.</v>

2813

<v Speaker 3>He's like one of those no MRI guys.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and this was more than 10 years ago.</v>

2836
02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:55.060
<v Speaker 3>This was probably 2002 while this was</v>

<v Speaker 3>some farms coming out of the corner of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mouth and he's like,</v>

02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:19.090
<v Speaker 3>seen maybe a handful of people do dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all do the same thing.</v>

2843
02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:20.590
<v Speaker 3>They smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they laid back,</v>

2844
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:22.870
<v Speaker 3>they tripped balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come back in 15 minutes and they're</v>

2845
02:06:22.871 --> 02:06:24.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2849
02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:33.520
<v Speaker 3>it just goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the next thing and then life goes</v>

<v Speaker 3>on and life is like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>one hit and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me have a more.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so we get out of the car and he's like,</v>

2890
02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:17.020
<v Speaker 1>just standing up and he's got his hand.</v>

2891
02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:19.750
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he just stole second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his hands on his knees,</v>

2892
02:08:19.751 --> 02:08:22.480

2894
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm walking down the driveway and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember visually seeing that gust of</v>

2895

<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get the shakes.</v>

2897
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:39.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like two degrees outside when we go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the house and we're just start</v>

2898
02:08:39.341 --> 02:08:41.650
<v Speaker 1>throwing thermals and shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I'm doing,</v>

2899
02:08:41.651 --> 02:08:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at him and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2900
02:08:43.571 --> 02:08:46.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't look so good dude.</v>

2901
02:08:46.241 --> 02:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2902
02:08:47.411 --> 02:08:49.690
<v Speaker 1>he's touching himself in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's turning gray,</v>

2903
02:08:49.691 --> 02:08:50.650
<v Speaker 1>start sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>

2904
02:08:50.651 --> 02:08:52.440

<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking feel good.</v>

2905
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go upstairs and get some water right</v>

2906
02:08:54.281 --> 02:08:56.890
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it progressed so quickly and he</v>

2907
02:08:56.891 --> 02:09:00.010
<v Speaker 1>looked like shit so bad that I'm over in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mirror looking at myself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I heard everything you said couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>respond though.</v>

02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:45.260
<v Speaker 3>I heard everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was stuck inside myself.</v>

2952
02:10:45.590 --> 02:10:49.610
<v Speaker 3>He had come out now his teeth or through</v>
<v Speaker 3>his lip here because he's hit the</v>

2953
02:10:49.611 --> 02:10:54.530
<v Speaker 3>banister and the chicks on acid now see</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blood and now they start freaking</v>

2954
02:10:54.531 --> 02:10:55.490
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2955
02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:56.540
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>17 girls have 19.</v>

2957
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking him to the hospital,</v>

2958
02:11:02.631 --> 02:11:06.080
<v Speaker 3>we can't go to the hospital and tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>them we've got a bunch of kids on and</v>

2959
02:11:06.150 --> 02:11:07.370
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2960
02:11:07.371 --> 02:11:09.500
<v Speaker 3>you just got to suck it up and tough it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2961
02:11:09.501 --> 02:11:13.160
<v Speaker 3>So he waited until the morning and got</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uncle because it just busted his lip</v>

2962
02:11:13.161 --> 02:11:15.260
<v Speaker 3>all up and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just tripped down into steps and hit</v>

2963
02:11:15.261 --> 02:11:17.720
<v Speaker 3>the banister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was the second time that we</v>

2964
02:11:17.721 --> 02:11:18.680
<v Speaker 3>almost killed his ass.</v>

2965
02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:21.140
<v Speaker 3>He did a gravity bong one time out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kitchen sink.</v>

2966
02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:22.580
<v Speaker 3>I really thought he was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2967
02:11:22.581 --> 02:11:27.581
<v Speaker 3>why would you ever touch weed again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in New York film it fear factor</v>

2968
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:32.990
<v Speaker 3>and I was with some friends that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if they get high and they</v>

2969
02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:34.700
<v Speaker 3>definitely don't get high on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>basis,</v>

2970
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but we're all having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're at a bar and it's post nine slash</v>

2971
02:11:38.121 --> 02:11:38.954
<v Speaker 3>11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2972
02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And so New York had a lively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird feel to it,</v>

2973
02:11:41.961 --> 02:11:44.420
<v Speaker 3>like a friendly feel to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very strange,</v>

2974
02:11:44.421 --> 02:11:47.600
<v Speaker 3>like after nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something happened in New York where it</v>

2975
02:11:47.601 --> 02:11:51.170
<v Speaker 3>was so devastated and horrible that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recovery process</v>

2976
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:54.680
<v Speaker 3>people are nicer to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very strange.</v>

2977
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.050
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a friendly feeling.</v>

2978
02:11:57.260 --> 02:11:59.750
<v Speaker 3>So we're all sitting outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in this bar,</v>

2979
02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:01.700
<v Speaker 3>we're having a couple of drinks were,</v>

02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:29.300
<v Speaker 3>it was really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all take a hit of this joint.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I take a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I passed to my friend.</v>

2995
02:12:31.251 --> 02:12:33.680
<v Speaker 3>He takes a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he passes it to this other guy and then</v>

2996
02:12:33.681 --> 02:12:37.040
<v Speaker 3>he passes it to my friend shy and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the producers on the show.</v>

2997
02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.090
<v Speaker 3>She takes a hit of it and her eyes</v>
<v Speaker 3>rolled back inside of her head and her</v>

2998
02:12:41.091 --> 02:12:44.100
<v Speaker 3>knees buckle and then she just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

2999
02:12:44.130 --> 02:12:47.270
<v Speaker 3>where on the street she dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped,</v>

3000
02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:49.610
<v Speaker 3>caught her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I caught her just in time,</v>

3001
02:12:50.090 --> 02:12:51.810
<v Speaker 3>caught her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3002
02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:52.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3003
02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:54.440
<v Speaker 3>we had to call the fire department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3004
02:12:54.441 --> 02:12:56.420
<v Speaker 3>we call nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fire department came and they</v>

3005
02:12:56.421 --> 02:13:00.030
<v Speaker 3>checked her out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could probably smell we a Myra if</v>

3006
02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.220
<v Speaker 3>somebody ran over a fucking scar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

3007
02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:05.061
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

3008
02:13:05.061 --> 02:13:05.421
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3009
02:13:05.421 --> 02:13:07.250
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're filming a fear factor here.</v>

3010
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:08.084
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3011
02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.320
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got dizzy.</v>

3012
02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:10.020
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3013
02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:10.853
<v Speaker 3>she got dizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3014
02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.880
<v Speaker 3>But just lucky we caught her man because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't catch her she was going to</v>

3015
02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 3>bounce her head off the concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she just went limp.</v>

3016
02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:23.600
<v Speaker 3>She just went like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our eyes went back and just went</v>

3017
02:13:23.601 --> 02:13:27.170
<v Speaker 3>like this and I think it was me and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend Tom Wind up catching her,</v>

3018
02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:29.720
<v Speaker 3>but it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was weird,</v>

3019
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 3>like her body just shut off or bodies</v>
<v Speaker 3>like too</v>

3020
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>much pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

3021
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Like her body was more comfortable going</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious than it was dealing with</v>

3022
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:39.060
<v Speaker 2>being that high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That quick,</v>

3023
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:41.800
<v Speaker 2>tell me if you've ever heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be the person that asked.</v>

3024
02:13:41.801 --> 02:13:44.430
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done acid coke.</v>

3025
02:13:44.431 --> 02:13:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd,</v>

3026
02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I've done ecstasy a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not For me.</v>

3027
02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I've done shrooms a couple times where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed it,</v>

3028
02:13:50.701 --> 02:13:51.870
<v Speaker 2>but after awhile I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3029
02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3030
02:13:53.341 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enough,</v>

3031
02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:55.800
<v Speaker 2>it's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3032
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:59.610
<v Speaker 2>But a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was when I first moved out here,</v>

3033
02:13:59.611 --> 02:14:03.990
<v Speaker 2>we went and saw pink floyd at the Rose</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bowl and we take a bunch of weed and</v>

3034
02:14:03.991 --> 02:14:06.390
<v Speaker 2>some drinks and he's got a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy and girl,</v>

3035
02:14:06.391 --> 02:14:10.200
<v Speaker 2>we're going to meet us there and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>brings shrooms and I'm just like,</v>

3036
02:14:10.201 --> 02:14:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pass.</v>

3037
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:15.360
<v Speaker 2>But the three of them do the shrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the middle of the concert and</v>

3038
02:14:15.361 --> 02:14:19.560
<v Speaker 2>fuck the pigs are inflated their balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're having a great fucking time.</v>

3039
02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:24.330
<v Speaker 2>And I looked to my left over here and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked back to my right and my friends</v>

3040
02:14:24.331 --> 02:14:27.510
<v Speaker 2>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gone and I hear screams and I</v>

3041
02:14:27.511 --> 02:14:32.511
<v Speaker 2>looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I looked down and he's passed out.</v>

3042
02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gone into a seizure.</v>

3043
02:14:34.801 --> 02:14:38.310
<v Speaker 2>So rose bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bleacher stadium seats.</v>

3044
02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:41.250
<v Speaker 2>So He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was he fell back and his</v>

3045
02:14:41.251 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 2>feet got locked up under the bleachers</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of him.</v>

3046
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:48.870
<v Speaker 2>So he's bent completely like this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking idiots behind him.</v>

3047
02:14:48.871 --> 02:14:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame them.</v>

3048
02:14:50.641 --> 02:14:52.470
<v Speaker 2>They got scared instead of catching</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

3049
02:14:52.471 --> 02:14:55.440
<v Speaker 2>they moved out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his head strikes the bleachers and he</v>

3050
02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:58.470
<v Speaker 2>starts going into a seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3051

3054
02:15:04.230 --> 02:15:08.100

<v Speaker 2>she saw it and she just immediately had</v>

3158
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I remember it took me when I first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

3159
02:19:23.350 --> 02:19:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I was a late bloomer on weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 21 when I started smoking.</v>

3160
02:19:26.381 --> 02:19:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I was 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3161
02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:28.423
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>

3162
02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:29.773
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

3163
02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:30.950
<v Speaker 2>It took me a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3164
02:19:31.170 --> 02:19:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I was ignorant to the whole idea of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to learn how to smoke,</v>

3165
02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:37.090
<v Speaker 2>how to take smoke into my lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3166
02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.490
<v Speaker 2>just that you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even dawn on me and I would</v>

3167
02:19:39.491 --> 02:19:40.030
<v Speaker 2>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3168
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 2>just take it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't call for anything.</v>

3169
02:19:41.541 --> 02:19:46.070
<v Speaker 2>So it took like a month before I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>high and the first time I got high I</v>

3170
02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:48.710
<v Speaker 2>remember freaking the fuck out and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to talk myself through it.</v>

3171
02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:49.544
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a plant,</v>

3172
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>you can't overdose unless you smoke your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body weight.</v>

3173
02:19:51.841 --> 02:19:54.260
<v Speaker 2>At least I heard that one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's even a newborn.</v>

3174
02:19:54.261 --> 02:19:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Preemie can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying this shit to myself,</v>

3175
02:19:56.151 --> 02:20:01.151
<v Speaker 2>but I kept asking questions out loud</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you guys hear my heartbeat and I</v>

3176
02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 2>was so scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3177
02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying and no one's</v>

02:20:04.741 --> 02:20:06.020
<v Speaker 3>It's got a fucked up guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

3180
02:20:06.021 --> 02:20:07.940
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go downstairs dude.</v>

3181
02:20:07.941 --> 02:20:11.370
<v Speaker 3>You're brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My step dad smoked weed and we stole it</v>

3182
02:20:11.371 --> 02:20:15.680
<v Speaker 3>once when I was in high school and me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my girlfriend and my friend Josh</v>

3183
02:20:15.681 --> 02:20:19.310
<v Speaker 3>smoked pot over my girlfriend's house</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were</v>

3184
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:23.950
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was 16.</v>

3185
02:20:23.970 --> 02:20:28.970
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend was 15 and we got so high</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we would wake up in the kitchen and</v>

3186
02:20:29.971 --> 02:20:33.330
<v Speaker 3>then wake up in the living room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we would miss time.</v>

3187
02:20:33.570 --> 02:20:35.880
<v Speaker 3>We'd be missing spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how did we get here?</v>

3188
02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Like I never forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're 16 you don't really get</v>

3189
02:20:39.691 --> 02:20:42.300
<v Speaker 3>paranoid because you're not worried too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much about stuff.</v>

3190
02:20:42.301 --> 02:20:45.280
<v Speaker 3>You too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain has a fully formed yet,</v>

3191
02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't really understand pot.</v>

3192
02:20:47.731 --> 02:20:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how much we smoked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just kept smoking it,</v>

3193
02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're 16 you don't know to stop,</v>

3194
02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:56.970
<v Speaker 3>you just keep smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just remember like my whole body</v>

3195
02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:02.160
<v Speaker 3>was tingling and were like lying on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>couch together and we couldn't move or</v>

3196
02:21:02.161 --> 02:21:02.971
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

3197
02:21:02.971 --> 02:21:04.710
<v Speaker 3>I can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden we were in the</v>

3198
02:21:04.711 --> 02:21:06.570
<v Speaker 3>kitchen stand in front of refrigerator.</v>

3199
02:21:08.390 --> 02:21:09.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3200
02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh we were too high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just didn't know what we had no idea</v>

3201
02:21:14.161 --> 02:21:15.840
<v Speaker 3>what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

3202
02:21:15.870 --> 02:21:19.740
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing that's cool about</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting people that don't get high as</v>

3203
02:21:19.741 --> 02:21:24.060
<v Speaker 3>you get to see that overwhelming rush</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they don't really know what this</v>

3204
02:21:24.061 --> 02:21:25.800
<v Speaker 3>is or what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3205

<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to give him weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3237
02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:33.030

3238
02:22:33.031 --> 02:22:36.030
<v Speaker 2>let them smoke a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he goes down and he gives him some</v>

3239
02:22:36.031 --> 02:22:38.060
<v Speaker 2>weed and he smokes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3240
02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:39.600
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stay here with you for</v>

3241
02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:42.960
<v Speaker 2>a few hours and few hours go by.</v>

3242
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:43.621
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to go to bed.</v>

3245
02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And the next day my cousin goes back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see him with some more weed and he's</v>

3246
02:22:49.470 --> 02:22:50.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was last night?</v>

3247
02:22:50.341 --> 02:22:52.140

<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel weird.</v>

3248
02:22:52.141 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I slept like a baby and he's like,</v>

3249
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:55.801
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

3250
02:22:55.801 --> 02:22:57.060
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try this again.</v>

3251
02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Day to not eating after almost two</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

3252
02:22:59.401 --> 02:23:03.240
<v Speaker 2>nothing smokes weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's sitting with them for a couple</v>

3253
02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:03.781
<v Speaker 2>of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3254
02:23:03.781 --> 02:23:04.840
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3255
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I could ate and he ate a plate</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Spaghetti and meatballs,</v>

3256
02:23:09.121 --> 02:23:12.600
<v Speaker 2>heavy ass meatballs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom on day two from smoking marijuana.</v>

3257
02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:15.690
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going because Maryland's way</v>

3258
02:23:15.691 --> 02:23:17.400
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>

3259
02:23:17.401 --> 02:23:22.401
<v Speaker 2>first and only a legal dispensary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the prime candidate for that shit.</v>

3260
02:23:23.131 --> 02:23:24.000
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3261
02:23:24.001 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 2>go get him a prescription now and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him smoke himself on the way out.</v>

3262
02:23:28.430 --> 02:23:31.400
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the saddest things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it being illegal and stigmatized for so</v>

3263
02:23:31.401 --> 02:23:33.510
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The so many people with diseases and</v>

3264
02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:36.350
<v Speaker 3>arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation,</v>

3268
02:23:43.941 --> 02:23:46.280
<v Speaker 3>going to give them relief and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurting anybody.</v>

3269
02:23:46.310 --> 02:23:47.143
<v Speaker 3>It's just a plant.</v>

3270

<v Speaker 3>whenever it doesn't hurt and the next</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

3309
02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of inflammation diseases,</v>

3310
02:25:12.231 --> 02:25:15.110
<v Speaker 3>like people that have like sore joints</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3311
02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:17.720
<v Speaker 3>problems with muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff's amazing.</v>

3312
02:25:17.721 --> 02:25:20.690
<v Speaker 3>It just loosens you up and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get you high.</v>

3314
02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:26.230
<v Speaker 3>You feel exactly the same and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will take it orally.</v>

3315
02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I take it orally occasionally,</v>

3316
02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.810
<v Speaker 3>any part that's sore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you take it orally,</v>

3317
02:25:31.811 --> 02:25:34.390
<v Speaker 3>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find that it relieves anxiety,</v>

3318
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:37.240
<v Speaker 3>it helps them relax and it doesn't fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>you up,</v>

3319
02:25:37.241 --> 02:25:39.130
<v Speaker 3>but you can drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're high,</v>

3320
02:25:39.131 --> 02:25:41.380
<v Speaker 3>you're paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just chills you out a little bit.</v>

3321
02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Just calms you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got a CBD vape pen.</v>

3322
02:25:45.251 --> 02:25:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I've tried the vape so the vape pens</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't work well for me.</v>

3323
02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:53.230
<v Speaker 3>The marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I plant works well for my system.</v>

3324
02:25:53.650 --> 02:25:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Even edibles don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took two stars.</v>

3325
02:25:55.841 --> 02:25:59.230
<v Speaker 3>A death in front of Joey Diaz didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>a damn thing to you.</v>

3326
02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:00.670
<v Speaker 3>This fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

3327
02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:01.630
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't get.</v>

3328
02:26:01.631 --> 02:26:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Jamie.</v>

3329
02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Jamie has one of those weird bodies</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he can eat like,</v>

3330
02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 3>what's the most amount of edibles you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever eaten?</v>

3331
02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen hundred milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

3332
02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:10.600
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what.</v>

3333
02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I would have to figure out</v>

3334
02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:18.190
<v Speaker 3>what that number is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go past that point and then dial it back</v>

3335
02:26:18.191 --> 02:26:20.500
<v Speaker 3>from there and I don't really want to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>past that fucking point,</v>

3336
02:26:20.501 --> 02:26:22.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1300 and saying I was trying to test to</v>

3337
02:26:22.871 --> 02:26:27.130
<v Speaker 3>see what a tip to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I don't know that I did.</v>

3338
02:26:27.131 --> 02:26:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I did a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I had to have like I did it</v>

3339
02:26:30.941 --> 02:26:32.980
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a thousand and played video games</v>

3340
02:26:32.981 --> 02:26:34.710
<v Speaker 3>and like five hours in.</v>

3341
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really tough to play games.</v>

3342
02:26:36.491 --> 02:26:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care,</v>

3343
02:26:37.511 --> 02:26:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to sit there anymore so</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to keep my attention on it.</v>

3344
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:44.410
<v Speaker 3>So it obviously worked at some point but</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't free.</v>

3345
02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't freaking out or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you describe.</v>

3346
02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I can't take more than a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go into the hundreds and I started</v>

3347
02:26:50.231 --> 02:26:55.231
<v Speaker 3>getting weirded out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I like I'm a 25 to 50 milligram guy</v>

3348
02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:57.160
<v Speaker 3>because it gives me a little little</v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

3349
02:26:57.161 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Just get a little high and I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless I want to go into the tank,</v>

3350
02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take 100 and going in the tank,</v>

3351
02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>but when I get in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>lied to and I stopped thinking,</v>

3352
02:27:07.841 --> 02:27:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I literally start thinking about things</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did when I was 14.</v>

3353
02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Like why did I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did I do that?</v>

3354
02:27:12.251 --> 02:27:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3355
02:27:13.121 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 3>forgive yourself.</v>

3356
02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:15.820
<v Speaker 3>You were 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop beating yourself up.</v>

3357
02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.150
<v Speaker 3>You're 40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I literally will think about stupid</v>

3358
02:27:19.151 --> 02:27:21.200
<v Speaker 3>shit that I did when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3359
02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.090
<v Speaker 3>it's so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it forces you to examine anything in</v>

3360
02:27:25.091 --> 02:27:27.490
<v Speaker 3>your life that you might have pushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside,</v>

3361
02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:31.750
<v Speaker 3>like you have to come to grips and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>restitution and figure out what the fuck</v>

3362
02:27:31.751 --> 02:27:36.370
<v Speaker 3>you did that for and why did you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>those thoughts and why'd you behave that</v>

3363
02:27:36.371 --> 02:27:38.890
<v Speaker 3>way and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you different now and how have</v>

3364
02:27:38.891 --> 02:27:42.010
<v Speaker 3>you grown past that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about marijuana that</v>

3365
02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:43.750
<v Speaker 3>it's really highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

3366
02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say it makes you paranoid and it</v>

3367
02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:51.280
<v Speaker 3>certainly does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of what that is is</v>

3368
02:27:51.281 --> 02:27:54.310
<v Speaker 3>just making you aware of things you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to.</v>

3369
02:27:54.311 --> 02:27:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Not think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's convenient for you in normal life</v>

3370
02:27:57.041 --> 02:28:00.190
<v Speaker 3>to not think about those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you get high on marijuana</v>

3371
02:28:00.191 --> 02:28:01.024
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3372
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:03.820
<v Speaker 3>there's some shit that's bothering you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're not even thinking about it.</v>

3373
02:28:03.970 --> 02:28:05.830
<v Speaker 3>He'd come with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go to the back of your head and I'm</v>

3374
02:28:05.831 --> 02:28:08.470
<v Speaker 3>going to shine a light on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at all this stuff.</v>

3375
02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:10.510
<v Speaker 3>What are you gonna do with that dress?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker?</v>

3376
02:28:10.511 --> 02:28:13.090
<v Speaker 3>How much you clean this shit up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3377
02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:14.950
<v Speaker 3>those pens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like them?</v>

3378
02:28:14.951 --> 02:28:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

3379
02:28:16.810 --> 02:28:18.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3380
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3381
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I occasionally will use a pen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I prefer</v>

3382
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:24.650
<v Speaker 2>smoking joints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I liked it.</v>

3383
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

3384
02:28:26.050 --> 02:28:26.883
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3385
02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:30.410
<v Speaker 2>so when from time to time I'll clean out</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3386
02:28:30.411 --> 02:28:33.170
<v Speaker 2>just my place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in just getting cluttered</v>

3387
02:28:33.171 --> 02:28:36.080
<v Speaker 2>opens up so many different avenues to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring other things in.</v>

3388
02:28:36.081 --> 02:28:39.380
<v Speaker 2>So I instead of just throwing it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

3389
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I make a game out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go out to the Pasadena Rose Bowl</v>

3390
02:28:42.471 --> 02:28:46.020
<v Speaker 2>and I just sell my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sit there in a parking space in</v>

3391
02:28:46.021 --> 02:28:50.240
<v Speaker 2>half by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I fucking sell garbage and my goal</v>

3392
02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:54.290
<v Speaker 2>every time is to sell everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever I don't sell,</v>

3393
02:28:54.291 --> 02:28:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I swing by goodwill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd donate it,</v>

3394
02:28:56.151 --> 02:28:58.580
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much have you made doing that?</v>

3395
02:28:59.050 --> 02:29:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I would average 350 bucks,</v>

3396
02:29:01.461 --> 02:29:03.760
<v Speaker 2>which is solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four or five hour day out there,</v>

3397
02:29:03.770 --> 02:29:05.270
<v Speaker 2>having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just yelling at people,</v>

3398
02:29:05.271 --> 02:29:07.190
<v Speaker 2>watching the goofs because you see a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

3399
02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:10.340
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird social experiment because</v>

3400
02:29:10.341 --> 02:29:15.341
<v Speaker 2>you see the people that are addicts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

3401
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:17.150
<v Speaker 2>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>belts,</v>

3402
02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:18.200
<v Speaker 2>leather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3403
02:29:18.201 --> 02:29:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Then you see people who are addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sale.</v>

3404
02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just too good to pass up.</v>

3405
02:29:23.781 --> 02:29:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that fucking iron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fifty cents.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm buying that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you have to have a license?</v>

3432
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:22.070
<v Speaker 2>You buy a permit and basically your park</v>
<v Speaker 2>at your space as a parking space in a</v>

3433
02:30:22.071 --> 02:30:23.120
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you get.</v>

3434
02:30:23.121 --> 02:30:25.070
<v Speaker 2>It's narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are right on top of you.</v>

3435
02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So I pull the truck in and then I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>set everything up behind it so I can</v>

3436
02:30:28.861 --> 02:30:31.240
<v Speaker 2>chill on the truck and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just put blankets down.</v>

02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like black and I just start yelling</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3438
02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Like God got cds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people still need to set up,</v>

3439
02:30:38.250 --> 02:30:39.110
<v Speaker 2>ready to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

3440
02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:44.750
<v Speaker 2>it's so much fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get out in the lane and also play a</v>

3441
02:30:44.751 --> 02:30:47.120
<v Speaker 2>game to a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would go once in a while and I'm</v>

3444
02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:56.471
<v Speaker 2>but our goal is you got to fucking sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had had a vhs self prostate exam</v>

3470
02:31:53.701 --> 02:31:58.530
<v Speaker 2>to feel this weird sensation in my chest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it spreads to my arms and it's</v>

3471
02:31:58.531 --> 02:32:01.320
<v Speaker 2>almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm almost powerless.</v>

3473
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:06.150
<v Speaker 2>And I see the circle start to close and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3474
02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.860
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm by myself.</v>

3475
02:32:07.861 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking away.</v>

3479
02:32:16.690 --> 02:32:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and I caught myself and I was able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep with it and I was texting,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I get back to myself and I start selling</v>

3486
02:32:35.191 --> 02:32:37.860
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of that day I fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>I thought I'd make 3:50.</v>

3492
02:32:46.770 --> 02:32:50.040
<v Speaker 2>So they start telling me that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the apartment complex have bets</v>

3493

<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're at the hospital.</v>

3508
02:33:29.490 --> 02:33:31.590
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what a hospital was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3509
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:35.920
<v Speaker 2>he said it took him a minute to come</v>

<v Speaker 2>feeling of like I didn't have my</v>

<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3546
02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:03.450
<v Speaker 3>It's got some sort of a nice tobacco</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaf outside,</v>

3547
02:35:03.641 --> 02:35:05.290
<v Speaker 3>but powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd inside.</v>

3548
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:07.390
<v Speaker 3>You just got to be careful at how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>hits you take.</v>

3549
02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

3551
02:35:09.731 --> 02:35:13.960
<v Speaker 3>like a little elevated thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had Charlie Murphy was always</v>

3552
02:35:13.961 --> 02:35:16.950
<v Speaker 3>into them and that's how I first got</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced to blunts,</v>

3553
02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:20.140
<v Speaker 3>was hanging out with Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did a tour together and when we would</v>

3554
02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:22.200
<v Speaker 3>get high together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie was always rolling blunts.</v>

3555
02:35:22.250 --> 02:35:22.811
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3556
02:35:22.811 --> 02:35:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try it.</v>

3557
02:35:24.011 --> 02:35:24.491
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3558
02:35:24.491 --> 02:35:25.600
<v Speaker 3>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3559
02:35:25.601 --> 02:35:26.770
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's different,</v>

3560
02:35:26.771 --> 02:35:28.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

3561
02:35:28.751 --> 02:35:30.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also something else.</v>

3562
02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:33.220
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a little extra kick,</v>

3563
02:35:34.090 --> 02:35:35.470
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3564
02:35:35.530 --> 02:35:40.120
<v Speaker 3>this pen thing and just people always</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find new ways to get fucked</v>

3565
02:35:40.121 --> 02:35:42.190
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's enough ways they're already</v>

3566
02:35:42.191 --> 02:35:43.200
<v Speaker 3>established.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3567
02:35:43.450 --> 02:35:44.220
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3568
02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:46.920
<v Speaker 3>the jaw joints are the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those dot.</v>

3569
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I was telling you about those doctors</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were talking before the show and</v>

3570
02:35:50.590 --> 02:35:55.120
<v Speaker 3>the thing he said about smoking a bowl</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just the only thing you have to worry</v>

3571
02:35:55.121 --> 02:35:55.390
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

3572
02:35:55.390 --> 02:35:57.190
<v Speaker 3>The butane you're sucking in from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighter.</v>

3573
02:35:57.430 --> 02:36:01.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not the smoking in glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't put it in like taste it.</v>

3574
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

3575
02:36:01.721 --> 02:36:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw a lighter the other day at a</v>

3576
02:36:03.451 --> 02:36:06.580
<v Speaker 3>shop that was a alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that before and I don't</v>

3577
02:36:06.581 --> 02:36:08.560
<v Speaker 3>know if that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's any better for</v>

3578
02:36:08.561 --> 02:36:10.540
<v Speaker 3>you or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was an alcohol lighter instead of</v>

3579
02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:12.520
<v Speaker 3>a butane lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine it would be better,</v>

3580
02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:15.760
<v Speaker 3>but I've used matches before for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>very reason because I could smell.</v>

3581
02:36:16.390 --> 02:36:19.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what cigars like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to light a cigar</v>

3582
02:36:19.031 --> 02:36:22.200
<v Speaker 3>with a butane lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stink and you're supposed to light</v>

3583
02:36:22.201 --> 02:36:23.950
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love the real cigar dorks,</v>

3584
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:26.980
<v Speaker 3>they'll take a cigar or or lighter</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>

3585
02:36:26.981 --> 02:36:31.981
<v Speaker 3>and they'll light a piece of cedar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the use that piece of Cedar to</v>

3586
02:36:32.111 --> 02:36:34.870
<v Speaker 3>light the cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no bullshit,</v>

3587
02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:36.700
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit fumes.</v>

3588
02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:40.690
<v Speaker 3>They'll take a match light the Cedar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then take that Cedar Light.</v>

3589
02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:43.210
<v Speaker 3>The cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3590
02:36:43.270 --> 02:36:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Not to blend fan though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I get it.</v>

3591
02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I've smoked enough of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

3592
02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I really liked the test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3593
02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Like joints?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can taste the weed guy.</v>

3594
02:36:50.191 --> 02:36:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the taste of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>
