17
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Once they get into office and thinking about some of the laws that are in place</v>

18
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 1>to protect corporations,</v>

19
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>think about some of the laws that are in place that fuck people over every day.</v>

20
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.461
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this desire to have someone lead us.</v>

24
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:47.491
<v Speaker 1>We all have this,</v>

25
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>this feeling where we need someone who's smarter and wiser,</v>

26
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>who represents us.</v>

00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>don't say Jack Shit.</v>

37
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>They say nothing.</v>

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>They grew up around dumb people.</v>

43
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>They go to work with don people.</v>

44
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no one in their family that's interesting or ask any questions at all</v>

45
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>and they just get stuck</v>

46
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.941
<v Speaker 3>right into it.</v>

47
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:24.774
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

48
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.641
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

49
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 3>society is so greedy.</v>

50
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 3>We're willing to go to war.</v>

51
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 3>We're willing to go places in [inaudible],</v>

52
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 3>these big metal machines that kill people and fuck people up just so we can make</v>

53
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.544
<v Speaker 3>more money.</v>

54
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 3>And the way our society is set up,</v>

55
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:40.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

56
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it argued and argued successfully that our society runs on war.</v>

57
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

58
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 3>it runs on the domination of the other parts of the world and literally that's</v>

59
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 3>the only way you can control a gigantic chunk of the glove.</v>

60
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 3>You have to keep everybody down.</v>

61
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

62
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 3>and that's what our society is based on.</v>

63
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>We can't be fighting over each other because you know this guys are like a</v>

64
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>million people die in Iraq.</v>

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.434
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

71
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.041
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

72
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And some people you don't know that were born somewhere else who fucking got</v>

<v Speaker 1>feels good.</v>

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>The fucking brother of the president of Afghanistan,</v>

106
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>his brother was selling heroin and getting paid by the CIA.</v>

107
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Heroin is absolutely addictive,</v>

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

111
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>People who try heroin get hooked on heroin is everywhere.</v>

112
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

113
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>so you need to sell it.</v>

114
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Someone selling who's selling it,</v>

115
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

116
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but 90% of it comes from this one place where we have to be to save our freedom.</v>

117
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't criticize it because if you criticize it,</v>

118
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you're a shithead.</v>

119
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't appreciate the troops and what they're doing for you,</v>

120
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the case at all.</v>

121
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like the idea of these fucking people leading us in any direction</v>

122
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>where you need to sacrifice your life.</v>

123
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>

124
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe them when there's been so many fucking lies.</v>

125
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean the more you look it up,</v>

126
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>the more they may go go into any of the stories on the weapons of mass</v>

127
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>destruction before we invaded and compare them to what we actually know that</v>

128
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>they really knew when they said that.</v>

129
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like they did it on purpose.</v>

130
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to get in there for whatever fucking reason and if it's some crazy,</v>

131
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>the world is going to end.</v>

132
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>If we don't stop this,</v>

133
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>but we can't tell you shit like I would love to believe you.</v>

134
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I would love to believe that the reason why you're a,</v>

135
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not telling us exactly what the fuck is going on is because you're really</v>

136
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>protecting us from some insanely evil thing that if we knew about it,</v>

137
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

138
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>society would collapse,</v>

139
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but our strong,</v>

140
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:42.641
<v Speaker 1>brave,</v>

141
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>powerful leaders or gun to guide us without our knowledge.</v>

142
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I would love to believe you if you weren't all full of shit.</v>

143
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have to step back and look at it all in a different way.</v>

144
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Dealing with all this nonsense that we have with the two party system.</v>

145
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 4>We're spinning our wheels.</v>

146
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:05.990
<v Speaker 4>We're not getting any traction.</v>

147
00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 4>This is all nonsense to same nonsense with Obama.</v>

148
00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:11.570
<v Speaker 4>If we dealt with with Bush special interest groups,</v>

149
00:05:11.571 --> 00:05:15.860
<v Speaker 4>controlling what people say and do and what direction the country goes in and</v>

150
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.810
<v Speaker 4>save us from the bad guys,</v>

151
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up,</v>

152
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:19.361
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

153
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:20.540
<v Speaker 4>It's the same nonsense.</v>

154
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.751
<v Speaker 4>Operation.</v>

155
00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:28.751
<v Speaker 4>Northwoods was something that was plotted out during the 1960s signed by the</v>

156
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Joint Chiefs of staff where they were going to fake terrorist attacks that</v>

157
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:37.640
<v Speaker 4>American civilians and blame it on the Cuban so we could go to war with Cuba and</v>

158
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 4>involved a bunch of Shit like blowing up a jetliner.</v>

159
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.030
<v Speaker 4>They were going to have a drone jetliner blow it up and say that people died on</v>

160
00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:44.121
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

161
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 4>And this was going to get everybody fired up about going to war with Cuba.</v>

162
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.950
<v Speaker 4>They were even going to tack won ton him obey.</v>

163
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.390
<v Speaker 4>They were going to arm Cuban friendlies to attack Guantanamo Bay so that we</v>

164
00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:54.560
<v Speaker 4>would have to go to war with Cuba.</v>

165
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.670
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the,</v>

166
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 4>our own government,</v>

167
00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 4>they plotted out.</v>

168
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 4>This is like real shit.</v>

169
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.800
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I,</v>

170
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.430
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>

171
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

172
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 4>JFK,</v>

173
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 4>the Oliver Stone movie and that was like,</v>

174
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 4>part of the premise that JFK,</v>

175
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 4>that Oliver Stone was,</v>

176
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

177
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 4>was pushing in this film is that they kill JFK because they want to stay in</v>

178
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam because they were making a lot of money into Vietnam.</v>

179
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 4>And I remember at the time seen that movie going,</v>

180
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 4>that is absolutely ridiculous.</v>

181
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck believes that I going to start wars and keep wars going just so</v>

182
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 4>that they can make money even though it's not a real war on a just war.</v>

183
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to go to a ward.</v>

184
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 4>That stupid hippie bullshit.</v>

185
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.401
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

186
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 4>as I got older and I started investigating history,</v>

187
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 4>you know from way back to Vietnam to the Gulf of Tonkin to all the shit that</v>

188
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 4>happened when the Kennedy and Nixon were an office to all the shit that happened</v>

189
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 4>with Reagan and the contras in Nicaragua and that sends an Easter and all the</v>

190
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 4>difference,</v>

191
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 4>various things that have happened in human history where it's clear that the</v>

192
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:47.860
<v Speaker 4>United States is,</v>

193
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

194
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking around with all kinds of things all the time to make money and</v>

195
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 4>that there's a bunch of people that are profiting off of war.</v>

196
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 4>And then there were doctors profiting like a little bit of money here and there.</v>

197
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.011
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>

198
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:58.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

199
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 4>you look at like what's going on with like how much money,</v>

200
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 4>how a and made for the war.</v>

201
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about billions and billions of dollars.</v>

202
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 4>That's like real money.</v>

203
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Eisenhower leaving office and he's giving a speech warning the American people</v>

204
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 4>about the power of the military industrial complex.</v>

205
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 4>You know when you watch that you like,</v>

206
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:17.811
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

207
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 4>here is a sitting president who's leaving office and what was the most important</v>

208
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 4>thing that he wants to tell people is that you have to be careful because there</v>

209
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 4>is a machine here that wants to go to war.</v>

210
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.430
<v Speaker 4>There's a business behind going to other countries and fucking people up and</v>

211
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 4>taking their shit,</v>

212
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 4>and they come up with reasons to do this and they sacrifice American lives to do</v>

213
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 4>this and they do it for profit.</v>

214
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 4>And it sounds absolutely ridiculous.</v>

215
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 4>It sounds absolutely outrageous that the greatest country on earth could be</v>

216
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 4>involved in something like that from the get go,</v>

217
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 4>but yet that's what history says.</v>

218
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 4>That's how it points the points in that direction.</v>

219
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 4>It points to that direction that it's going in</v>

220
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 5>and the councils of government,</v>

221
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.260
<v Speaker 5>we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,</v>

222
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.000
<v Speaker 5>whether sought an orange zone by the military industrial complex.</v>

223
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.940
<v Speaker 5>The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will</v>

224
00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:12.774
<v Speaker 5>persist.</v>

225
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 5>We must never let the weight of this combination in danger,</v>

226
00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:18.450
<v Speaker 5>our liberties or democratic processes.</v>

227
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.283
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

228
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

229
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.120
<v Speaker 6>Tower seven disturbs me the most.</v>

230
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 6>That tower seven just went just like a controlled demolition</v>

231
00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.341
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>

232
00:08:59.341 --> 00:08:59.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

233
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>but it had holes in the building and you see the hole in the building.</v>

234
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.401
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

235
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I see the hole in the building,</v>

236
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't it fall towards that whole,</v>

237
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>why is it falling like that?</v>

238
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense to me.</v>

239
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:10.314
<v Speaker 1>With tower seven</v>

240
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>the way tower seven foul,</v>

241
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:18.411
<v Speaker 1>it just kinked in the middle and fell down three false bead almost.</v>

242
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody liked they'll,</v>

243
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll nitpick at you.</v>

244
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:20.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

245
00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>it was one 10th of a second slower than free fall.</v>

246
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Even if it was just close to free fall.</v>

247
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.231
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

248
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>There was no resistance.</v>

249
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It just gave up why we did life wiggle and collapse towards where Jack got</v>

250
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:31.531
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>

251
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

252
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a controlled demolition that that bothers me.</v>
