00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Play it on Youtube and,</v>

152
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>and we also play,</v>

153
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

154
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>the audio is what's incredible,</v>

155
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 2>but then he starts talking about glassine and he's like,</v>

156
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>we were just coming around the meadow.</v>

157
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.330
<v Speaker 2>We were just glass and go.</v>

158
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.071
<v Speaker 2>And then we were like,</v>

159
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>let's go,</v>

160
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Speaker 2>let's go ask.</v>

161
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 2>And he gives,</v>

162
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.051
<v Speaker 2>keeps going.</v>

163
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:41.411
<v Speaker 2>Glass,</v>

164
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:41.711
<v Speaker 2>glass,</v>

165
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.011
<v Speaker 2>glass,</v>

166
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:42.551
<v Speaker 2>glass and glass,</v>

167
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 2>which is looking through binoculars,</v>

168
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 2>which we discovered,</v>

169
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 2>but then we played it so much.</v>

170
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.731
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>

171
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I would post a picture of myself,</v>

172
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>like I'm about to go on and be like,</v>

173
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.014
<v Speaker 2>are you glassing?</v>

174
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

175
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.341
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

176
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 2>like if you talk to somebody like,</v>

177
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.201
<v Speaker 2>what'd you do today?</v>

178
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:56.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

179
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:56.471
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

180
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:56.921
<v Speaker 2>I hung out.</v>

181
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>And they were like glassing and you're like,</v>

182
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:58.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

183
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:00.860
<v Speaker 2>So then it morphed into meaning like just chill.</v>

184
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>And I dunno,</v>

186
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of picked up from there.</v>

187
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 2>So I just have so many of these though.</v>

188
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

189
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.770
<v Speaker 2>What's the deal with jeans</v>

190
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>calling everybody jeans?</v>

191
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Like when you guys were on that and you had to explain it to me.</v>

192
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 2>You know what the latest thing is with that?</v>

194
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 2>First we had an electrician over at the house and whenever you're in the house,</v>

195
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>you know you're calling your spouse,</v>

196
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.171
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

197
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Jane's do you know,</v>

198
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>cause that's what I call her.</v>

199
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 2>So then she walked down the stairs and he goes,</v>

200
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>gene,</v>

201
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 2>would you like me to put the,</v>

202
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 2>so he and we just let it go.</v>

203
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 2>We called her jeans,</v>

204
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.611
<v Speaker 2>but then we started,</v>

205
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Starbucks and ordering our drinks.</v>

206
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a stupid thing like that we told our listeners,</v>

207
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>

208
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 2>we do this regularly just to amuse ourselves,</v>

209
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:44.711
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

210
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 2>we'll call them jeans and then say thank you mommy,</v>

211
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 2>or I love you mommy at the end.</v>

212
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 2>And no one ever,</v>

213
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 2>the order happens so fast and it's so like programmed that they never catch it.</v>

214
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.291
<v Speaker 2>Never say like,</v>

215
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.124
<v Speaker 2>what did you say?</v>

216
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.153
<v Speaker 2>So like when I,</v>

217
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.480
<v Speaker 2>when I pulled up like,</v>

218
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 2>welcome to Starbucks,</v>

219
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.801
<v Speaker 2>what can I get for you?</v>

220
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.634
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like a,</v>

221
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.811
<v Speaker 2>hey jeans,</v>

222
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I want to get an iced coffee,</v>

223
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 2>extra ice and what do you want?</v>

224
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 2>A double tall sort latte.</v>

225
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

226
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>That'll be a six many words.</v>

227
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

228
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 2>thanks mommy.</v>

229
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I just pull up.</v>

230
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 2>So we told them we did that.</v>

231
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>People sent us videos of them doing it.</v>

232
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hilarious.</v>

233
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like getting his,</v>

234
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>he was talking to a bill play place and he's like,</v>

236
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>hey mommy,</v>

237
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what this bill means.</v>

238
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:27.724
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy's like,</v>

239
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.031
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

240
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 2>So that first section,</v>

241
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>like they don't even address that you're calling someone mommy or jeans or</v>

242
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 2>saying thank you mommy,</v>

243
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 2>or I love you mommy.</v>

244
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.051
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

245
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:35.321
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

246
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:36.150
<v Speaker 2>have a good day.</v>

247
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.983
<v Speaker 2>Like they just,</v>

248
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>it speaks more to almost how preprogrammed customer service becomes,</v>

249
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 2>they're not even acknowledging that you're saying something ridiculous to them.</v>

251
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.443
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

252
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

253
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

254
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

255
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

256
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.051
<v Speaker 2>But also like,</v>

257
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying when someone says something like that to you?</v>

258
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You probably like,</v>

259
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 2>you're so scrambled.</v>

260
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:54.191
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

261
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

262
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Cause it doesn't make any sense.</v>

263
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>It started off not making any sense,</v>

264
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 2>but then it picked up and made a lot of sense.</v>

265
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

266
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.501
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

267
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.090
<v Speaker 2>well clearly you can talk English and then it gets to the end.</v>

268
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>He calls you mommy and you're like,</v>

269
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

270
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

271
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>One time we called the,</v>

272
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 2>the renaissance in Cincinnati,</v>

274
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>the hotel,</v>

275
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.411
<v Speaker 2>the hotel,</v>

276
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 2>because the year before,</v>

277
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.014
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

278
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 2>a few months before my son was born,</v>

279
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 2>we were there for a wedding and Christina had like a 32nd fart.</v>

280
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

281
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 2>she's very pregnant.</v>

282
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.970
<v Speaker 2>We came back and we talked about it and we decided it deserved its own names.</v>

283
00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>What's called the Cincinnati Fart.</v>

284
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

285
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:29.361
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

286
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:34.361
<v Speaker 2>And we figured out what room number we were in and we called the hotel and I go,</v>

287
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

288
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.881
<v Speaker 2>can I help you?</v>

289
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

290
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.943
<v Speaker 2>I want a book.</v>

291
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I want to stay there,</v>

292
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 2>but I want to commemorate the Cincinnati part.</v>

293
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

294
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

295
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.663
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

296
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

297
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.620

00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Unless he only had a tag for a cow.</v>

508
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

509
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.090

<v Speaker 1>not a bull.</v>

513
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it depends on the unit.</v>

514
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how many cows they have versus how many bowls they have.</v>

515
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:23.690
<v Speaker 1>They might want people to kill cows.</v>

516
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.690
<v Speaker 1>They probably want a certain amount of cows to be killed a year.</v>
