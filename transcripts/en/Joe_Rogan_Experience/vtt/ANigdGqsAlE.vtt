00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

2
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>What's up boys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nice to have you guys on man.</v>

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice first of all to a nice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you guys in studio,</v>

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's nice to have more tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've been a giant fan of for so</v>

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's starting to get more</v>

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>ground in America and we've done our</v>
<v Speaker 1>best to try to promote it as much as</v>

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>possible and here and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating for the longest time for me</v>

8
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>watching what I think is like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most exciting combat sports in the world</v>

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of kind of slip under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>radar man when golf is taken off golf,</v>

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>so everywhere they had a scrabble on</v>
<v Speaker 1>espn one time and that was just gut</v>

11
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>wrenching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scrabble.</v>

12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Well it is a sport so a lot of training</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>But to see that and then to see us just</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nothing,</v>

15
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>no coverage whatsoever for so long and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>finally on tv but still relatively under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radar.</v>

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to watch but you knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be there eventually,</v>

18
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's nice every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time we take another step,</v>

20
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>like when it got on access tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was such a giant leap compared to</v>

21
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>where it was prior to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>what's coming next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's coming next?</v>

23
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time and the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>people coming along and doing the right</v>

24
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One can only hope it's when we talked</v>

25
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>about this today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

26
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>the Dana white had a point that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably right about,</v>

27
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>is that in a lot of people's eyes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing got poisoned with that old</v>
<v Speaker 1>pka karate stuff that was on and like</v>

29
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>the eighties and the nineties put a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste in people's mouth.</v>

30
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to break free from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality of you think kickboxing,</v>

31
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Muay Thai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think pants fighting?</v>

32
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the shoes and everything.</v>

33
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

34
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you do that thing with the pants and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

35
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I took a buddy of mine who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>he's a producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a producer of fear factor.</v>

37
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Actually my friend David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took him to some Moy Thai fights in</v>

38
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a local show that was at some</v>

39
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.091
<v Speaker 1>hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:02.091
<v Speaker 1>they just had a ballroom and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was back when I'm God,</v>

41
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck was fighting on that card</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

42
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember,</v>

43
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some good names,</v>

44
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>some really good fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like back in 2000,</v>

45
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2002.</v>

46
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had never seen like Moitai before.</v>

47
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>He really had no idea what to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

48
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they kicked the legs,</v>

49
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>it makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

50
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a fucking huge difference.</v>

51
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you have to,</v>

52
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>somebody asks you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was more tight every I feel.</v>

53
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really dislike when I have to say it's</v>

54
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>like kickboxing with elbows and knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I died a little bit inside every</v>

55
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>time I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of how long you want to</v>

56
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>sit there and talk to this person</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can be like,</v>

57
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually this,</v>

58
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:39.331
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

59
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like fixed kickboxing?</v>

60
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

61
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>see you later with Ella was a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're late like well kick as hard to</v>

62
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks the same when you're looking at</v>

63
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're watching glory it looks</v>

64
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

65
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And then when people talk about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

66
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I've had people over watching the fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go,</v>

67
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't Moitai well it's similar.</v>

68
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like on the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the difference between</v>

69
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>American football and rugby.</v>

70
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Like they're similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're running,</v>

71
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the same whatsoever.</v>

72
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>The two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're two different sports that</v>

73
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>dissimilar because it is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely because it's a completely</v>

74
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>different pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different mentality.</v>

75
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

76
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you're limited on a just a few weapons</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems very minor,</v>

77
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but in an icu fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you do it,</v>

78
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's night and day.</v>

79
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It's night day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that it would make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

81
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a big adjustment for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are listening that don't know what</v>

82
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxing,</v>

83
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>if you watch like glory or now Bella</v>
<v Speaker 1>tours having kickboxing as well,</v>

84
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>and of course k one was really the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>one to start it on a global scale and</v>

85
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>make these big gigantic events over in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

86
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxing does not allow the use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>elbows or knees and the very limited</v>

87
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>amount of clinching.</v>

88
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in Moitai,</v>

89
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>especially in Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a tremendous amount of clinching</v>

90
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's very technical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on in that clenching</v>

91
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and I've always maintained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a big fan of lion fight</v>

92
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>because what lion fight is doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving you the actual pure Moitai you</v>

93
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the dancing and the music and</v>

94
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff that happens before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>in a traditional Moitai fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a really good job.</v>

97
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you said,</v>

98
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>they've had to a limit a few of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in order to get it out there to</v>

99
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>the general public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's unfortunate that you can't</v>

100
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just like throw it out there</v>

101
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and people's faces with all the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tradition is particularly here</v>

102
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:25.961
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people turn away from it so fast.</v>

104
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>So I think at some point we'll be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build up to that,</v>

105
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start slowly,</v>

106
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm educating people on what that is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history and everything and hopefully</v>

107
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>eventually we won't get so far away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

108
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does become kickboxing because</v>

109
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>we've taken so much from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

110
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And for people who don't know what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

111
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.714
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

112
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dance that you do,</v>

113
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>the warmup dance before a Moitai match</v>
<v Speaker 1>called why crew.</v>

114
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how long does it usually take it?</v>

115
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>It depends really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

116
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different gyms,</v>

117
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a different people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

118
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>do longer and shorter ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a very limited,</v>

120
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 1>a shorter one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a when I fight.</v>

121
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it in forever but,</v>

122
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and knowing that people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to really want to see it,</v>

124
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of Americanize it and shorten</v>

125
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>it where some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some,</v>

126
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Cruz and then fights in the past.</v>

127
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what's a long one?</v>

128
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of has like one of the longest ones</v>

129
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he takes his sweet time,</v>

130
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes down those everything like</v>

131
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

132
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a whole routine.</v>

133
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>But then in those situations like people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very educated and they want to see</v>

134
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>that they want to see the beauty of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost becomes part of the entertainment</v>

135
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>part of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but besides the fight itself.</v>

136
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>But when you go see a professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moitai match,</v>

137
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I would estimate that like 50 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd trains.</v>

138
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>They're very educated in what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

139
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like baseball here in America where</v>

140
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to play baseball in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to appreciate and love it because it's</v>

141
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>our pastime and that's what it is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand.</v>

142
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyone there is actively training</v>

143
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>or fighting or has fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so embedded in their culture</v>

144
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they just love it and they</v>

145
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it.</v>

146
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So to go to a live Muay Thai fight in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand is just,</v>

147
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you can't even describe it.</v>

148
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I could only imagine it's on my bucket</v>
<v Speaker 1>list for sure,</v>

149
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to see a live event in</v>

150
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of the audience at least is either</v>

151
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>people from the gym or people that know</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from the gym and it's sort of</v>

152
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>almost an incestuous kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

153
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially like when I was coming up,</v>

154
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the only people that were there trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>were family or friends of the people</v>

155
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>so that you weren't hitting this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wider audience,</v>

157
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are now.</v>

158
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It is getting on TV and there are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it who,</v>

159
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>who don't know anything about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's slowly building momentum and</v>

160
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>getting out there and getting a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more popular.</v>

161
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's just one of those sports where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not for everybody.</v>

163
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you gotta find the way to,</v>

164
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>to bring it to everyone.</v>

165
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

166
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have this mass appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight in itself does,</v>

167
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all,</v>

168
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes with it is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very traditional.</v>

170
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>The Thai style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the music is very traditional</v>

171
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for a lot of people,</v>

172
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't have an open mind.</v>

173
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.780
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

174
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

175
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.170
<v Speaker 1>It's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like we were saying,</v>

176
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it live compared to watching it</v>

177
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like two different things.</v>

178
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

179
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even for me,</v>

180
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch it on TV and then I'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in person.</v>

181
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez man,</v>

182
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>like why do people do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

183
00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this.</v>

184
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sad,</v>

185
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's without any combat sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

186
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 1>when you're there live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could feel it.</v>

187
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You feel the energy in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel the impact as opposed to</v>

188
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>watching it on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still great,</v>

189
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>but nothing compares to being there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

190
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>particularly moved tie.</v>

191
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

192
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I agree in that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it when you're</v>

193
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>not hearing any commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just literally feeling the slap of</v>

194
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>the shins bone to bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes me cringe.</v>

195
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I was in la a couple of years back when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had that big pro Moitai event.</v>

196
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of big name fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and book how fought and he,</v>

197
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some beef with some dude that he</v>

198
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:11.984
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>gonna fight and there was a lot of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk back and forth.</v>

200
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>So we had this long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why crew where he was shooting arrows at</v>

201
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

202
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the NPL,</v>

203
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

204
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

205
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>What happened to that organization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing that happens to a lot of</v>

206
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

207
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to go too hard out the gate.</v>

208
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>They pay all this money for all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>super high level fighters,</v>

209
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.760
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

210
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>your mood tie fans going to know who</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

211
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your general public has no idea.</v>

212
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's who we're trying to reach is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the people that don't know anything</v>

213
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.050
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people aren't going to come out</v>

214
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 1>just because there's a high level</v>
<v Speaker 1>multitech I,</v>

215
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't know who this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't anything about them.</v>

216
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.950
<v Speaker 1>They'd be more likely to come out to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>a local person because at least I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

218
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy flights out of California or</v>

219
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

220
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>and that's</v>

221
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 2>been the biggest thing that's a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow mo tie down is these promotions</v>

222
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 2>tried to go too hard out the gate and as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to building it up,</v>

223
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to lose a lot of money and build</v>

224
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 2>these people with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to start slow and build people</v>

225
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>gradually build a promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build the fighter's,</v>

226
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 2>build your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually you can get to that level</v>

227
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone in the card is like top</v>

228
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 2>10 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't do that from the beginning</v>

229
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 2>when you were just trying to grow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>build.</v>

230
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I went to the event and uh,</v>

231
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Larry Merchant was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the boxing guy,</v>

232
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Larry merchant was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people were there and</v>

233
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] was doing commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

234
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.363
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

235
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.770
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

236
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 3>it seems like these guys have got it</v>

237
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.850
<v Speaker 2>too big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too fast,</v>

238
00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too many big names right away,</v>

239
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:39.394
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rent,</v>

240
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure they ran out of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>like by the second or third show,</v>

241
00:09:41.951 --> 00:09:44.980
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where a lion fight has been</v>

242
00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 2>doing a really good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like growing their talent and trying</v>

243
00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:49.840
<v Speaker 2>to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like every shoe they,</v>

244
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 2>they're putting really good fights and</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good match ups with guys from</v>

245
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:54.064
<v Speaker 2>around here.</v>

246
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

247
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the match ups and the talent level is</v>

248
00:09:57.701 --> 00:10:01.300
<v Speaker 3>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way higher than the credit it's</v>

249
00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.020
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a Dvr and my gym,</v>

251
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

252
00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:08.890
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what number they up to now,</v>

253
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:13.891
<v Speaker 3>like 30 something 30 to 32.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got way back to like 21 or</v>

254
00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:17.590
<v Speaker 3>something just saved up and I can watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>them all while I train.</v>

255
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.110
<v Speaker 3>And it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's such high level.</v>

256
00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 3>There's so much good fights are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

257
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:22.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many good guys.</v>

258
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 3>It's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

259
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.400
<v Speaker 3>it's such a dynamic technical sport and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I think is</v>

260
00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:32.500
<v Speaker 3>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably,</v>

261
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:36.350
<v Speaker 3>it probably slips by some people when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the casual observers watching it.</v>

262
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Just some of the stuff that we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing today when you were showing me</v>

263
00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:44.341
<v Speaker 3>just a little little shifts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>variations and stances and little things</v>

264
00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:46.780
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

265
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when you train in it or</v>

266
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.600
<v Speaker 3>you try it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes the experience of watching</v>

267
00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:55.990
<v Speaker 3>people compete in it richer because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of understand,</v>

268
00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:56.381
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

269
00:10:56.381 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Speaker 3>this is very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on here.</v>

270
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not just guys going around and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fucking kick each other.</v>

271
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so much.</v>

272
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.510
<v Speaker 2>There's so many levels to this and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your casual fan isn't going to know that</v>

273
00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:07.940
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

274
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.550
<v Speaker 2>in a big problem a lot of promotions</v>
<v Speaker 2>make is they try to cut corners and put</v>

275
00:11:12.551 --> 00:11:15.940
<v Speaker 2>guys out there who aren't very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But both those guys are at the same</v>

276
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.200
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for your average person,</v>

277
00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:17.561
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

278
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.150
<v Speaker 2>they're kicking and punching each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

279
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.790
<v Speaker 2>But they might be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very low level,</v>

280
00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:24.910
<v Speaker 2>but they just wanted to get some cheap</v>
<v Speaker 2>people they could put on the air,</v>

281
00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'll,</v>

282
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.160
<v Speaker 2>they'll take all the cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these corners just just to save some</v>

283
00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:31.690
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end it hurts everybody</v>

284
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.280
<v Speaker 2>because you're putting crappy flights</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

285
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not good matchups,</v>

286
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.190
<v Speaker 2>not very talented guys because you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save some money or there they'll</v>

287
00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 2>spend so much money on like the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

288
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.220
<v Speaker 2>the main event that they have to cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>those corners with everybody else.</v>

289
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:49.510
<v Speaker 2>And so you're putting these crappy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights out there in your brain trying to</v>

290
00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:51.670
<v Speaker 2>bring this new audience in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people come and like this is</v>

291
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:52.510
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

292
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Why would I to come to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.640
<v Speaker 4>because because they're bad matchups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

294
00:11:55.641 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 4>and as we were talking about line fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they did from the beginning was</v>

295
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 4>they had quality matchups throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire card.</v>

296
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Whether it was the main event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was undercard,</v>

297
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 4>whether it was the amateurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're good,</v>

298
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 4>exciting matchups regardless of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

299
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's what really helped build them</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

300
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.920
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long have you been fighting Moitai</v>

301
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started when I was 10 back in Lima,</v>

302
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.730
<v Speaker 4>Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how long have,</v>

303
00:12:16.731 --> 00:12:17.331

306
00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:22.260

<v Speaker 4>everything was so small back then,</v>

324
00:12:59.481 --> 00:13:01.610
<v Speaker 4>like the amount of talent there is now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>powerhouse in the future.</v>

333
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Is it because of one coach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just as the country embraced it?</v>

334
00:13:25.581 --> 00:13:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Is it taken off in popularity?</v>

335
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.340
<v Speaker 4>It's getting a little more popular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>So</v>

344
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just fascinating that that one part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world is starting to produce a</v>

345
00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:54.950
<v Speaker 3>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really high level talent and then</v>

346
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.360
<v Speaker 3>talking to you about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347

<v Speaker 3>you were saying that it's like soccer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Moitai is like really like</v>

348
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.540
<v Speaker 3>coming up in popularity behind soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sounds crazy,</v>

349
00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:02.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

350
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

351
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then our soccer team suck so</v>

352
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.340
<v Speaker 4>everybody's trying to turn to Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's really cool to see.</v>

353
00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.250
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch</v>

354
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.340
<v Speaker 3>that is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

355
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.850
<v Speaker 3>more tie is the predominant striking art</v>
<v Speaker 3>in MMA,</v>

356
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the most,</v>

357
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say probably the most successful</v>

358
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.360
<v Speaker 3>striking art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mma because it has all the elements of</v>

359
00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:25.950
<v Speaker 3>boxing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

360
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:28.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the elements of a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other traditional martial arts.</v>

361
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:33.150
<v Speaker 3>But there's something about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of kicks and elbows and</v>

362
00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:38.151
<v Speaker 3>knees and the technical style of Moitai</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really lends itself to mma.</v>

363
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think when Maury Smith came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Maury Smith was probably the first</v>

364
00:14:43.201 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 3>guy who was like a really high level</v>
<v Speaker 3>technical striker who gave him a mayor</v>

365
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 3>try and was showing everybody the</v>
<v Speaker 3>effectiveness of Thai</v>

366
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 1>in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason it never</v>

367
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>translated to Moitai getting more</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular in mma,</v>

368
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't necessarily translate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moitai getting that much more popular.</v>

369
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:09.611
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things that with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma it kind of helps and it hurts,</v>

371
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 1>like it helps in the sense that it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out there,</v>

372
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>but it can hurt as well when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting a bad representation</v>

373
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 1>of the sport you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

374
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So for a good stand up striker in MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might not be that great when it</v>

375
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 1>comes to the tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.881
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're saying,</v>

377
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got really great stand up</v>

378
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has really great standup for MMA.</v>

379
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:34.810
<v Speaker 1>So people assume that that's what good</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup looks like in a more tire,</v>

380
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 1>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional stand up art,</v>

381
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

382
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pros and cons of,</v>

383
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 1>of it getting out there.</v>

384
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's stuff,</v>

385
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything kind of helps as well as</v>

386
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>takes away from the sport to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think all martial arts make an</v>

387
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 1>adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to make a technical adjustment</v>

388
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>when they're being applied to mma</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to deal with the take</v>

389
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with all the and even</v>

390
00:15:56.481 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and judo had to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjustments for more time because as</v>

391
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>soon as you involve leg kicks and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>

392
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys were shooting for take</v>

393
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 1>downs and is going to need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting into the face like that</v>

394
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

395
00:16:09.421 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

396
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Michael Page fight crazy knockout where</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole head got crushed from that</v>

397
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 1>knee surgery and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

398
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got literally had to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpture back together again.</v>

399
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>It was the most brutal injuries I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

400
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen one of those before?</v>

401
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a skull get crushed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

402
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I actually had my skull fractured but</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like that.</v>

403
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.180
<v Speaker 1>That was the one of the worst things</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen.</v>

404
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>How did your school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked in the back of the head and</v>

405
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.070
<v Speaker 1>the guy had a steel plate in his Shin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guard in China.</v>

406
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.850
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any shinguard yeah.</v>

407
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 1>So we had a shin guard on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a steel plate in it.</v>

408
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really think anything of it at</v>

409
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 1>this was like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 1>we would just fight all everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

412
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.681
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:53.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not really think twice about it.</v>

414
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

415
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.800
<v Speaker 1>so I fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kicked me in the back of the head.</v>

416
00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I got dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got up,</v>

417
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I ended up knocking him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought again the very next day.</v>

418
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm Wyatt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Not Knock this guy out to.</v>

420
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we got back to the states I was</v>

421
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 1>having headaches all the time and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I had a bad concussion,</v>

422
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like up to like almost like a month</v>

423
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 1>later I kept seeing these flashes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>light every,</v>

424
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.330
<v Speaker 1>anytime someone would ever touch me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd be working with little kids or girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>and smaller people and just them</v>

426
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.660
<v Speaker 1>touching me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get this jolt and you know,</v>

427
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of freaking me out and I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting ready for another fight</v>

428
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to get my Mri or a cat scan.</v>

429
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

430
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of inch and a half crack in the</v>

431
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 1>back of your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

432
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you're not a vegetable</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

433
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.780
<v Speaker 1>You should be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you even hit that again,</v>

434
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably kill you.</v>

435
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Doctors always say that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

436
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.260
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the last you were fucking</v>

437
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 2>knocked out one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead.</v>

438
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 2>It was one inch closer to my spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be dead.</v>

439
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.390
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

440
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.770
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty a rough thing to happen</v>

441
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do anything other than hit</v>

442
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:04.340
<v Speaker 2>the bag by myself for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how long it was to like</v>

443
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.530
<v Speaker 2>let it heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

444
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.630
<v Speaker 2>but it was a toy just essentially how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>close on its own.</v>

445
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get it.</v>

446
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:16.610
<v Speaker 2>And I was getting ready for a fight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually still tried to fight anyway.</v>

447
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

448
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 2>that doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who doctor who diagnosed it was the</v>

449
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 2>doctor for the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

450
00:18:22.921 --> 00:18:23.880
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

451
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:24.691
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't fight.</v>

452
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long after that was the fight?</v>

453
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 2>After the diagnosis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a week.</v>

454
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I said cat fight with fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

455
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 2>that's just kind of the mentality I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up,</v>

456
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

457
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 2>And how old were you at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five.</v>

458
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So he just felt invulnerable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

459
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my,</v>

460
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 2>my mentality from the beginning has</v>
<v Speaker 2>always been I'm going to fight as long</v>

461
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 2>as I'm breathing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten into fights with some of the</v>

462
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>worst injuries ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broken hands,</v>

463
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken skulls,</v>

464
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:59.340
<v Speaker 2>broken faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's just the way I came up,</v>

465
00:18:59.341 --> 00:19:00.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to fight no matter</v>

466
00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fight anyone anywhere,</v>

467
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any weight class.</v>

468
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I was able to get as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience as I did back there.</v>

469
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

470
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.520
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

471
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 2>it was the mentality we had coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

472
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 2>this was that time when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.770
<v Speaker 2>youtube wasn't even out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

474
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:22.170
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew what was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like you gotta be ready to fight</v>

475
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:24.550
<v Speaker 2>all the time or else you're never going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get any fights.</v>

476
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're now,</v>

477
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:29.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like everyone's kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for the big show or oh,</v>

478
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 2>pick in there like a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a month is short notice for people</v>

479
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.090
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like an hour.</v>

480
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

481
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 2>we're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

482
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 2>we're here to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

483
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just the time I came up was a</v>

484
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 2>different mindset than it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of the pros and cons of</v>

485
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting bigger is the bigger things get.</v>

486
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:48.660
<v Speaker 2>You got to take the kind of fake or</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with it.</v>

487
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.553
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

488
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started and I was at fights,</v>

489
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:56.210
<v Speaker 2>it's like you knew every person that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that fight was a die hard and we tie</v>

490
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no other reason to do this</v>

491
00:19:58.291 --> 00:20:01.150
<v Speaker 2>other than the fact that you loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're losing money.</v>

492
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no show to get on.</v>

493
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 2>There was no television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no reason to do this sport</v>

494
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.610
<v Speaker 2>except for the fact that you loved that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't,</v>

495
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.100
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a question like there's no reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this except for you.</v>

496
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Love it with everything that's in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone,</v>

497
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone you talked to,</v>

498
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 2>every gym you went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fight you went to,</v>

499
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you were surrounded by people that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same heart and mentality is you.</v>

500
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Whereas now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are doing it for different</v>

501
00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:29.300
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

502
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they want to get famous or they</v>

503
00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:33.400
<v Speaker 2>want to get instagram followers or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

504
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 2>they want to look cool doing pad work</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of the good and the bad</v>

505
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.230
<v Speaker 2>of things getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that by the sport getting</v>

506
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>more popular by more people paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to it,</v>

507
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>it opens up the door to more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

508
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>but they just don't have the pure</v>

509
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 1>intention of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of waters down the sport</v>

510
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Speaker 1>at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because there's got</v>

511
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

512
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a line right between like where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's intelligent to fight injured.</v>

513
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Like with your broken head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>

514
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 1>that would never tell anyone to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

515
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Would you think you would be in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation today or would you go,</v>

516
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what wisdom?</v>

517
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to fight with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

518
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.640
<v Speaker 1>but fortunately I have good people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around me who,</v>

519
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 1>who would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not smart,</v>

520
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

521
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

522
00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

523
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a time where if I don't take</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fight,</v>

524
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One another fight is going to come along</v>

525
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:25.550
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

526
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You got to take what you can get when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get it.</v>

527
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I'm like fighting people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who outweighed me by 30 pounds and you</v>

528
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just taking a fight on a couple</v>

529
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 1>hours notice because you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

530
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.020
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't opportunities so you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what you had to do to get in there</v>

531
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:40.870
<v Speaker 1>and he had to get experience and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the only way you were going to get</v>

532
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:41.690
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

533
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it difficult to motivate yourself</v>

534
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 1>during those times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for a lot of people,</v>

535
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.630
<v Speaker 1>motivation requires some sort of an end</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal or at least so much about.</v>

536
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It was more about getting fights and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about,</v>

537
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 1>what am I getting out of this fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't about making money,</v>

538
00:21:58.421 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't about getting on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

539
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but there was a long period of time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't get a fight to save my</v>

540
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:07.000
<v Speaker 1>life and that's when I was highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering switching over to mma</v>

541
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:09.940
<v Speaker 1>because everyone I trained was fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting in the UFC there</v>

542
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 1>getting fights all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight and every month and I'm</v>

543
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 1>sitting there busting my ass and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>only get a fight or two a year.</v>

544
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

545
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 1>there was a time I had over 30 fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall through that I was training for and</v>

546
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:22.210
<v Speaker 1>preparing myself for it.</v>

547
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 1>And then they'd fall through and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall through in the late fall through.</v>

548
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I started just taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing fight.</v>

549
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Even though I'd never trained boxing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life or taking a San shall fight that</v>

550
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 1>that one in China was a sand shall fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just had to do what I had to</v>

551
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>do to stay busy or taking a flight on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day's notice or fighting with a cracked</v>

552
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 1>skull because I knew I had to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and stay active and stay busy or</v>

553
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>else I'm never going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if I want to compete with</v>

554
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 1>guys who have like 400 fights and been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting since they were eight years</v>

555
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:45.911
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

556
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to fight against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like that?</v>

557
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so much to make up for it</v>

558
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:51.250
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

559
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start till I was 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

560
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm so late to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mentality was always I'm always going</v>

561
00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>to be playing catch up no matter how</v>
<v Speaker 1>good I get,</v>

562
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing catch up and so I got to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I can every way I can.</v>

563
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wasn't the smartest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't be where I am today if I</v>

564
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't take those risks and maybe take</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

565
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Not so smart fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

566
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 1>there is a fine line between putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out there and being dangerous,</v>

567
00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know where that line is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

568
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

569
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 1>So that for me it was all for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was always on that.</v>

570
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do it no matter what</v>

571
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 1>because where do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stub your toe and you're limping a</v>

572
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:26.910
<v Speaker 1>little bit or you're not fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

573
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to do it.</v>

574
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

575
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 1>When you say you started at 23,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that when you started competing as</v>

576
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the first time I stepped foot in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gym.</v>

577
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You were 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No training at all in martial arts</v>

578
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What motivated you to get in there?</v>

579
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:42.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

580
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever saw him when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>tie it was like 94,</v>

581
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.500
<v Speaker 2>90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>94 and 96.</v>

582
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I went back when espn used to play them</v>
<v Speaker 2>late at night,</v>

583
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.640
<v Speaker 2>like the old school fights in hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always thought about boxing and</v>

584
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 2>doing some kind of fighting in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I always love martial arts,</v>

585
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I saw them I was like that's it</v>

586
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause cause every other kind of thing</v>

587
00:24:04.491 --> 00:24:08.370
<v Speaker 2>with like kicking and knees was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo or point point fighting and</v>

588
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.350
<v Speaker 2>not that real boxing style of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hardcore fighting,</v>

589
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I saw them once I was like,</v>

590
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to do anything that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be it,</v>

591
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately at that time I was too</v>

592
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:25.841
<v Speaker 2>busy living in Vegas and drinking myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>to death every day and party and you</v>

593
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was never one of those serious</v>

594
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I never,</v>

595
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I never told anybody about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never,</v>

596
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.850
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't even know how serious I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was because obviously I couldn't do what</v>

597
00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 2>it lived the way I was living in</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete.</v>

598
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 2>So I knew that if I was ever going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

599
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I would have to completely stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking,</v>

600
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 2>partying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living the lifestyle I was living.</v>

601
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't ready to give that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't ready to give up my friends and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose all these people.</v>

603
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Not to say that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew that was a possibility.</v>

604
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I only ever told one of my friends</v>

605
00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:57.360
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name was moe and um,</v>

606
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always figured people would laugh at</v>

607
00:24:59.421 --> 00:25:01.520
<v Speaker 2>me if I told them I want to be a fighter</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day.</v>

608
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:04.290
<v Speaker 2>If you knew me back then you probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have left him when he talking</v>

609
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drink every single day,</v>

610
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>all you do is party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told him and to my surprise,</v>

611
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:12.100
<v Speaker 2>he didn't laugh at me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

612
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you,</v>

613
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.150
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go after it?</v>

614
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

615
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was only like 18 at the time.</v>

616
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And at that point I thought it was way</v>
<v Speaker 2>too old to start.</v>

617
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't start now.</v>

618
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't start now and make it anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

619
00:25:24.771 --> 00:25:26.450
<v Speaker 2>These people are starving in there like</v>
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>

620
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It's too late for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

621
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you should do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

622
00:25:30.041 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to do something you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

623
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.511
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

624
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:35.030
<v Speaker 2>he was born with a bad heart and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up passing away.</v>

625
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I promised myself when he died that</v>

626
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

627
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go after this dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

628
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 2>if not for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then for him because he was never able</v>

629
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live,</v>

630
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unfortunately his death sent me just</v>

631
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 2>in a really bad downward spiral.</v>

632
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Even more so than I was already in</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and partying and all that</v>

633
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this continued on for years and</v>

634
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.440
<v Speaker 2>years and in through a month long series</v>
<v Speaker 2>of really horrible things happening,</v>

635
00:26:03.441 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 2>like friends dying or almost killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

636
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:08.210
<v Speaker 2>drunk driving and myself getting pulled</v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

637
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 2>doing like 120 on the two slash 15 in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

638
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 2>And for whatever reason the cop let me</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

639
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was just the,</v>

640
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.590
<v Speaker 2>all these things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was this huge wake up call for</v>

641
00:26:18.591 --> 00:26:21.020
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that if my friend was</v>

642
00:26:21.021 --> 00:26:23.780
<v Speaker 2>still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would beat the shit out of me.</v>

643
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

644
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wasting your life.</v>

645
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 2>You're wasting this dream you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're too scared to do it.</v>

646
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 3>His dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean you would never even stepped</v>

647
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:35.720
<v Speaker 3>foot in the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like a dream of you one day</v>

648
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 3>attempting to learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

649
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very crazy thing because it was</v>

650
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.670
<v Speaker 3>always hanging over your head then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

651
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>And was again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

652
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 1>was that thing where I'm not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get anywhere in this,</v>

653
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but I finally realized that where I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to isn't what matters.</v>

654
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Like how good I can get doesn't matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>me giving myself all of myself to this</v>

655
00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>sport and dedicated myself to this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what really matters.</v>

656
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I make it to,</v>

657
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I could make it so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be the best in the world or the</v>

658
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 1>worst in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as I'm putting myself out</v>

659
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that more important?</v>

660
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the most thing important to put</v>

661
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 1>everything you have into it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just always believed that if you're</v>

662
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Speaker 1>going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all or nothing,</v>

663
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

664
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted to see half asset and</v>

665
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that's why I knew if I was going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I'd have to give up partying and</v>

666
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:30.270
<v Speaker 1>drinking and hanging out with my friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and going out all the time and I wasn't</v>

667
00:27:30.271 --> 00:27:31.104
<v Speaker 1>ready to do that.</v>

668
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

669
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I've always been in that mentality of if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do something,</v>

670
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:38.380
<v Speaker 1>do you do it all the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do it at all because.</v>

671
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Because you're sabotaging yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can just say,</v>

672
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.810
<v Speaker 1>oh I didn't make it because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the other.</v>

673
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why was it so what,</v>

674
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 1>what were you getting out of it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

675
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 1>when you realized that it wasn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how good you get or how far you</v>

676
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about giving it everything you</v>

677
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it had to do with seeing my</v>

678
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:59.880
<v Speaker 1>friend pass away it at 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to ever halfway do</v>

680
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:06.130
<v Speaker 1>something because there's people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get the opportunity to,</v>

681
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Speaker 1>to even attempt to go after these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>because because of whatever reason they</v>

682
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 1>might die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have a disease,</v>

683
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 1>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.540
<v Speaker 1>not have all their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>

686
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can't be the great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do this.</v>

687
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You can at least attempt this and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>owe it to yourself and you owe it to</v>

688
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:25.020
<v Speaker 1>them to give it everything that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

689
00:28:25.021 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like I owed him everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go after my life with everything.</v>

690
00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I have all my dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to go after 100 percent because</v>

691
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 1>there's people that don't get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking this because I think this is</v>

692
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:40.640
<v Speaker 1>a common theme with people is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pursuing a dream or when they're</v>

693
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 1>attempting to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized somewhere along the line</v>

694
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:49.290
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing something more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like trying to get really good at</v>

695
00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Moitai or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

696
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank with whatever sport it</v>

697
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:54.050
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eye.</v>

698
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I was the expression that was used as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts are a vehicle for</v>

699
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:01.920
<v Speaker 1>developing your human potential and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that until you have a really</v>

700
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:05.170
<v Speaker 1>difficult task in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like becoming a professional Moitai</v>

701
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.030
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most difficult tasks</v>

702
00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:10.470
<v Speaker 1>and all combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you have that task in front of</v>

703
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:13.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you go down that road and realize</v>

704
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 1>how much is actually required of Hugo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how much you can give to</v>

705
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:17.420
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

706
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you do realize how much your</v>

707
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.290
<v Speaker 1>capable of giving you something and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can give a little more and then you</v>

708
00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 1>can give a little more than you realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I give my all I did,</v>

709
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch what I ate.</v>

710
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Did I sleep enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I do,</v>

711
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 1>did I think about things the right way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I get anxious when I shouldn't have?</v>

712
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Did I that I keep my mind clean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

713
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 1>What was I doing wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was I doing right?</v>

714
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 1>How can I improve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it sort of trickles over into</v>

715
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

716
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

717
00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

718
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>for me it's always been all or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

719
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

720
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 1>but looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of understand the mentality</v>

721
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 1>behind it is there's so many things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to come up that will deter you</v>

722
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:57.004
<v Speaker 1>from going after.</v>

723
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get injured or maybe you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting the opportunities and if</v>

724
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not in it 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are going to steer you</v>

725
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are going to make you quit.</v>

726
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It's that people kind of look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have made it as if they just had</v>

727
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:12.660
<v Speaker 1>this easy path and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

728
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>They're in the spotlight and they're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world champion and doing these things.</v>

729
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:18.430
<v Speaker 1>But it's like any person who's made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a high level,</v>

730
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:20.780
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an athlete or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>businessperson,</v>

731
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.230
<v Speaker 1>if you go back in their life and see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things they've had to do and overcome</v>

732
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.430
<v Speaker 1>the obstacles in their way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

733
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why everyone's like,</v>

734
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to deal with this or</v>

735
00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what they had to deal</v>

736
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

737
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that always a problem when you do</v>

738
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 1>something kind of condensed to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance?</v>

739
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you watch like Gabriel go out</v>

740
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:41.050
<v Speaker 1>the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at him,</v>

741
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 1>he's 19 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He destroys that guy,</v>

742
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 1>was the guy's name Josh a shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shepherd who was a really talented</v>

743
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 1>fighter herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out and destroys this guy in the</v>

744
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.320
<v Speaker 1>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

745
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard could he have worked?</v>

746
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.020
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a young kid.</v>

747
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I was training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Karen and I were training that</v>

748
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 1>kid and I was like running him to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground every single day.</v>

749
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really good.</v>

750
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 1>He's a really talented already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

751
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this position right now.</v>

752
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:07.330
<v Speaker 1>This is where you're going to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to work really hard,</v>

753
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.081
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

754
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I dedicated myself to him throughout his</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp too.</v>

755
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're training together.</v>

756
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:17.221
<v Speaker 1>When I was fighting for my world title</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and then he just kept training and</v>

757
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.870
<v Speaker 1>going and he's trained like three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that fight and that's why he looked</v>

758
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dedicated everything to that.</v>

759
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Also super talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also there's something about being 19,</v>

760
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

761
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there something about being like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really what is it?</v>

762
00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Is it a physical thing or is it a mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

763
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it that you don't have as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility?</v>

764
00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

765
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

766
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super rare that a guy is like 35</v>

767
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 1>and then how long is Gabriel been</v>
<v Speaker 1>training for?</v>

768
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even like,</v>

769
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.080
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even that good at before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was okay.</v>

770
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 1>He was good but like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get back until he went to</v>

771
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Thailand and he started taking like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tough fights.</v>

772
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Even training for him since he was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>

773
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think of that.</v>

774
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.580
<v Speaker 1>That's only six years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

775
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's very rare that a guy will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 34 and then at when he's 39,</v>

776
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:10.130
<v Speaker 1>he's this motherfucker have</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers like he is,</v>

777
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>

778
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered like is it that</v>

779
00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:19.161
<v Speaker 1>life just you burden yourself down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and information and just</v>

780
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 1>life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relationships,</v>

781
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

782
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Just dress existential angst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

783
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grave calling know there's,</v>

784
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 1>there's so many variables that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like pinpointed on one specific</v>

785
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

786
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 1>everybody in everybody's variables are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be different.</v>

787
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>

788
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>we all have different things to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deal with.</v>

789
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Just because I've used yours is maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not that difficult.</v>

790
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

791
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Everything he's dealing with.</v>

792
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know everything I'm dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with or have had to overcome.</v>

793
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.440
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I sat there and listened to his</v>

794
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.011
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

795
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't want to do that.</v>

796
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like when you go back and watch Mike</v>

797
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Tyson when he was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go see Mike Tyson,</v>

798
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 1>like hitting the bag with teddy atlas</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's 19.</v>

799
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Just go Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does anybody get that good.</v>

800
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens from 13 to 19?</v>

801
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that someone can just</v>

802
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.720
<v Speaker 1>reach that insane level and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it happens primarily when someone's</v>

803
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:18.340
<v Speaker 1>really young.</v>

804
00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I started when I was 10 and when</v>

805
00:33:21.881 --> 00:33:23.920
<v Speaker 4>I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can ask Karen like I felt</v>

806
00:33:23.921 --> 00:33:24.790
<v Speaker 4>invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

807
00:33:24.791 --> 00:33:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Like I will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will take much.</v>

808
00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:27.311
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin,</v>

809
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:29.740
<v Speaker 4>I will take any fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any it didn't matter,</v>

810
00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

811
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.100
<v Speaker 4>I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't fight as an adult yet because</v>

812
00:33:33.101 --> 00:33:36.490
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we lied and said that I was 18.</v>

813
00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:38.710
<v Speaker 4>And so because I ran out of people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

814
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.570
<v Speaker 4>I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ran out of juniors to fight.</v>

815
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:45.990
<v Speaker 4>So from 16 to 18 I was technically an</v>
<v Speaker 4>adult and I was just taking this many</v>

816
00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:50.890
<v Speaker 4>fights at anywhere from 132 pounds to</v>
<v Speaker 4>147.</v>

817
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.150
<v Speaker 4>Any fight that I could possibly take us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed to get the experience and</v>

818
00:33:55.151 --> 00:33:57.880
<v Speaker 4>that's what I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to dedicate my life to it.</v>

819
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's possible for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>older person?</v>

820
00:34:01.301 --> 00:34:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Like so like Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

821
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.330
<v Speaker 1>You obviously you were still young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 23 mean you're saying you were</v>

822
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.050
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people listening to God 23,</v>

823
00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you're still like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still learn a lot.</v>

824
00:34:13.061 --> 00:34:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean relatively though for the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin was old and I'll have people come</v>

825
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:18.721
<v Speaker 1>up to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

826
00:34:18.721 --> 00:34:19.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm too old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

827
00:34:19.481 --> 00:34:20.970
<v Speaker 1>how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 19.</v>

828
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

829
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.640
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't even start till I was 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

830
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Because people just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people just like to view things</v>

831
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.970
<v Speaker 1>as an excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

832
00:34:27.971 --> 00:34:29.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it because x,</v>

833
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.050
<v Speaker 1>but we all have something that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>point to and be like,</v>

834
00:34:32.051 --> 00:34:34.210
<v Speaker 1>well I can't make it because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

835
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.400
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's people who have had that and</v>

836
00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:39.700
<v Speaker 1>worse and have made it so what excuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you possibly have?</v>

837
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.760
<v Speaker 1>You are a very technical fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very technical guy.</v>

838
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that maybe there is some</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit in having started a little bit</v>

839
00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 100 percent that,</v>

840
00:34:50.201 --> 00:34:52.950
<v Speaker 1>that I think that's a huge thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

841
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that just because you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.080
<v Speaker 1>when you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a kid,</v>

843
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.570
<v Speaker 1>there's so much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're just doing it and for</v>

844
00:34:58.571 --> 00:34:59.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put once you,</v>

845
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.813
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've</v>

846
00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.490
<v Speaker 1>matured in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

847
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.710
<v Speaker 1>like I started to for only one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the best I can be on,</v>

848
00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

849
00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm developed enough physically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally to apply these things to,</v>

850
00:35:14.201 --> 00:35:15.034
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

851
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.590
<v Speaker 1>to what I'm trying to apply them to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best fighter I can.</v>

852
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Whereas yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're younger you're still,</v>

853
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you're still growing and learning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing physically as well as</v>

854
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 4>mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

855
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:24.410
<v Speaker 4>like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

856
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 4>my first fight I was 11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

857
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I was doing there,</v>

858
00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I just knew like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kinda liked it but I like,</v>

859
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.240
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have like a purpose to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just really enjoyed training at</v>

860
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was exciting.</v>

861
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.020
<v Speaker 4>It was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

862
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.850
<v Speaker 1>want to try them out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't like,</v>

864
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the best in the world</v>

865
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't come to like 14,</v>

866
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.590
<v Speaker 1>15 when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

867
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I really want to dedicate my life to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know where you were living in America at</v>

868
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

869
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I was in Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you come to America?</v>

870
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.340
<v Speaker 1>When I was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were 13 years,</v>

871
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>did you go straight to CSA?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the first year?</v>

872
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I started a for text and then when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>

873
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008.</v>

874
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I met Karen and ever since we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>inseparable would you guys have a very</v>

875
00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:09.381
<v Speaker 1>unique gem and it's one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important things for a young fighter is</v>

876
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 1>to find the right environment to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

877
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about that earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

878
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:18.261
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get unlucky and find a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach in a bad gym and you get all</v>

879
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 1>tangled up with that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically and they become family</v>

880
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

881
00:36:23.021 --> 00:36:27.030
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of fucked and it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult break for a lot of fighters to</v>

882
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

883
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

884
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I honestly,</v>

885
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been truly blessed since I started</v>

886
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:36.910
<v Speaker 1>all the way to now because I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Rodrigo then I was with son of</v>

887
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 1>somebody who Kevin still trains with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this day to this day a little bit.</v>

888
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:42.140
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

889
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I've always had really good coaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I started.</v>

890
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think another,</v>

891
00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:50.280
<v Speaker 1>another unfortunate thing is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because somebody is a great coach</v>

892
00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're great for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

893
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:54.060
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you'll see these people</v>

894
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:57.750
<v Speaker 1>like leave their camps and go to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high level coach who's had a lot</v>

895
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 1>of success with certain individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean they're going to</v>

896
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 1>be great for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I try to always tell people,</v>

897
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 1>you have to find what works best for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

898
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's your diet,</v>

899
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:11.430
<v Speaker 1>whether it's your training scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What works for me won't always work for</v>

900
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

901
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.510
<v Speaker 1>You got to find what's best for you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't always necessarily mean I</v>

902
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>need this great coach because you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>might just clash.</v>

903
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like like coaches and fighting.</v>

904
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 1>It's very much about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a relationship with</v>

905
00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:24.800
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

906
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 1>with another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just might clash together,</v>

907
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 1>not work and it's also how will you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>said is super important about finding</v>

908
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:34.410
<v Speaker 1>that winning formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's training,</v>

909
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's coaching,</v>

910
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 1>and then Jim partners like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys are fantastic partners.</v>

911
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.310
<v Speaker 1>You guys work together really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched a lot of videos that you</v>

912
00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:44.760
<v Speaker 1>guys trained together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

913
00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>how critical is that to have someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an elite fighter that trains with</v>

914
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you on a daily basis and it's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most most important things.</v>

915
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.270
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many factors that go into</v>

916
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 1>building a fighter.</v>

917
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

918
00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one thing needs to constantly</v>

919
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:05.490
<v Speaker 1>be adjusted because the way I trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>today isn't how I trained even a year</v>

920
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You continually need to be hopping back</v>

921
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.390
<v Speaker 1>and forth on this line of too much in</v>
<v Speaker 1>too little of one point.</v>

922
00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 1>The difference between how you train</v>
<v Speaker 1>today versus how you turn a year ago.</v>

923
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say I'd say the older I get,</v>

924
00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the more it's a mental approach kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

925
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

926
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:26.750
<v Speaker 1>like my technique in the [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to be altered that much at</v>

927
00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:28.860
<v Speaker 1>this stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way that I apply them,</v>

928
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.260
<v Speaker 1>the way I go about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I think about them,</v>

929
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 1>it very much is gonna Change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

930
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>at a certain stage you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you</v>

931
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 2>have all these weapons to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of which ones you use</v>

932
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 2>at which time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at which speed,</v>

933
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.500
<v Speaker 2>in the way that you apply them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where in the beginning you're just</v>

934
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:48.070
<v Speaker 2>trying to do things well and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to almost put all these tools in</v>

935
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 2>the toolbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

936
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.360
<v Speaker 2>as your career develops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but better at a certain stage.</v>

937
00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Not to say I'm not adding more is that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these tools.</v>

938
00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I need to figure out how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ones work best for me and which</v>

939
00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:00.760
<v Speaker 2>ones work worked for me at which time</v>
<v Speaker 2>against which opponent,</v>

940
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which venue,</v>

941
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 2>which sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

942
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:05.740
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things that you can play</v>

943
00:39:05.741 --> 00:39:08.040
<v Speaker 2>with and adjust and good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

944
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 2>that was a huge thing I struggled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>after my knee surgery was like almost</v>

945
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 2>forgot how to fight as myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

946
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

947
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:17.910
<v Speaker 2>here's all your weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick up which ones you want to use.</v>

948
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

949
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which ones I used in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I put them together and it took me a</v>

950
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>series of fights to find myself again as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fighter in the ring.</v>

951
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 2>How much time did you take off because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need surgery?</v>

952
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Nine weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine months.</v>

953
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 2>In one week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was between fights.</v>

954
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 2>That was between the day I blew my knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and the day I got back in the ring.</v>

955
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had acl reconstruction?</v>

956
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Throw me an ACO.</v>

957
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Which way did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cadaver?</v>

958
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had that way.</v>

959
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I just talked to a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had it done.</v>

960
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.200
<v Speaker 3>They took a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was an Austrian,</v>

961
00:39:49.201 --> 00:39:52.900
<v Speaker 3>a skiing accident and they took some</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat out of her calf I've never even</v>

962
00:39:52.901 --> 00:39:54.800
<v Speaker 3>heard of before and reconstructed it,</v>

963
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was those options,</v>

964
00:39:56.961 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take anything else out</v>

965
00:40:00.111 --> 00:40:02.150
<v Speaker 2>of myself into it might weaken that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

966
00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I got enough to deal with now I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't weekend something else.</v>

967
00:40:04.641 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 2>So for me it was an in and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>other athletes that have had it,</v>

968
00:40:08.061 --> 00:40:11.180
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like the better approach for</v>

969
00:40:11.181 --> 00:40:11.700
<v Speaker 2>me and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

970
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and it has worked best for me.</v>

971
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.230
<v Speaker 3>It worked best for me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had both knees reconstructed.</v>

972
00:40:16.231 --> 00:40:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I had my left one done with the Patella</v>
<v Speaker 3>tendon graft with.</v>

973
00:40:18.571 --> 00:40:21.870
<v Speaker 3>They take a big chunk on your patella</v>
<v Speaker 3>tendon with a piece of bone from your</v>

974
00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Shin and a piece of bone from your knee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's fine.</v>

975
00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:27.960
<v Speaker 3>But that was like a year before it felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>good again.</v>

976
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.740
<v Speaker 3>But the right knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have zero problems with it.</v>

977
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:35.100
<v Speaker 3>And I was training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing Jujitsu again in six months.</v>

978
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

979
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:36.810
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

980
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.780
<v Speaker 3>and it was with no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it never really,</v>

981
00:40:39.781 --> 00:40:41.670
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no consequences for the</v>

982
00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:44.460
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the left one still like where</v>

983
00:40:44.461 --> 00:40:48.000
<v Speaker 3>they cut the bone out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I kneel down on a hardwood</v>

984
00:40:48.001 --> 00:40:49.170
<v Speaker 3>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could still feel it.</v>

985
00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.960
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that are scared</v>

986
00:40:51.961 --> 00:40:53.790
<v Speaker 3>of cadavers though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're scared her</v>

987
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.060
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for me,</v>

988
00:40:56.061 --> 00:40:58.940
<v Speaker 2>it was more of a mentally a strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

989
00:40:58.941 --> 00:40:59.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

990
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.170
<v Speaker 2>to have something of someone else's who</v>
<v Speaker 2>passed away and you know,</v>

991
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.050
<v Speaker 2>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a weird,</v>

992
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.960
<v Speaker 2>very weird thing mentally to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of deal with.</v>

993
00:41:08.961 --> 00:41:09.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

994
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just a scaffolding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

995
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

996
00:41:13.191 --> 00:41:13.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

997
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.561
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

998
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 3>is they take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually they use,</v>

999
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an achilles tendon because it's much</v>

1000
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:20.080
<v Speaker 3>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually 150 percent,</v>

1001
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger than the original acl.</v>

1002
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 3>They take that Achilles tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put it in place,</v>

1003
00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:30.241
<v Speaker 3>and then your body re proliferates that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tendon with its own tissue.</v>

1004
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that tendon is not</v>

1005
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 1>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body fills it up with cells because</v>

1006
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:42.011
<v Speaker 1>they reattached the blood supply and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body starts it starts using that to</v>

1007
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 1>regenerate tissue so it puts your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>

1008
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 1>but in the form of a much larger tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of interesting.</v>

1009
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.780
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My my right leg,</v>

1011
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 1>which is the one that blew off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels so much better than my left one</v>

1012
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:59.750
<v Speaker 1>does like stronger and looks thick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use a thick ass fucking tent.</v>

1013
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have a shitty design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human body that acl in particular,</v>

1014
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to get everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced.</v>

1015
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you figure out heal hooks,</v>

1016
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 1>as soon as people figured out he looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just realized like,</v>

1017
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knee is like so stupid.</v>

1018
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Who figured that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who designed this?</v>

1019
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Because all you have to do is get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>heel here and like,</v>

1020
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 1>pop just pops off.</v>

1021
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.030
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1022
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens all the time and Jujitsu guys</v>

1023
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:25.100
<v Speaker 1>get their knees blown apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives me nightmares,</v>

1024
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just watching that.</v>

1025
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's.</v>

1026
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean some guys get nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watch you guys kick each other.</v>

1027
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I know I've blown up a couple acl is</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking people.</v>

1028
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure didn't feel good,</v>

1029
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1030
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 1>was it a planted leg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

1031
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Most of the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of tough guys.</v>

1032
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I tried to come in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on and on.</v>

1033
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright man,</v>

1034
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.430
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1035
00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why a lot of people like learning</v>

1036
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:55.031
<v Speaker 1>how to absorb and take up a punch or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick is just as if not more important</v>

1037
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>than than throwing it because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get hit.</v>

1038
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how good you are,</v>

1039
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hit and if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to take that and absorb it and</v>

1040
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 1>minimize the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a lot of really</v>

1041
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 1>serious injuries and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1042
00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately so much of what we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is applied to the offensive side of it.</v>

1043
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Hitting people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 1>and those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have to take a punch</v>

1045
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you don't want to just be</v>

1046
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:16.251
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1047
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to learn how to take punches</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

1048
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.210
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1049
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a skill that you need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:24.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a subtlety to it that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost on a lot of people.</v>

1051
00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 1>The ability to just move with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way I was trying to tell people</v>

1052
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have someone hold their hand up and you</v>

1053
00:43:30.081 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 1>punch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then have them move the hand just a</v>

1054
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:32.744
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And you still try to punch you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't feel good.</v>

1056
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1057
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 1>like it feels good when they meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

1058
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.500
<v Speaker 1>people hold pads and they slap you with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1059
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels good,</v>

1060
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 1>you hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

1061
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone just kind of pulls away a</v>

1062
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of the punch is diminished.</v>

1063
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1064
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>it really just drain the life out of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you feel like you're giving</v>

1065
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:53.140
<v Speaker 1>someone all you have in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1066
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting them.</v>

1067
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:59.950
<v Speaker 1>But nothing is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have the winning a big shield,</v>

1068
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can we use it sometimes to train us</v>

1069
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 1>like towards the end of camp and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful because you're giving everything,</v>

1070
00:44:07.701 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to this thing and it's just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

1071
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.420
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing coming back at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no,</v>

1073
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:18.140
<v Speaker 1>there's no reverb off your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're punching into a cloud</v>

1074
00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh gosh,</v>

1075
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:24.170
<v Speaker 1>well I've seen some gyms that have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy 300 pound bag that just sits on</v>

1076
00:44:24.171 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even swing,</v>

1077
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it just sits there and you wind up</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking that thing.</v>

1078
00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1079
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that good?</v>

1080
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it good to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

1081
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It's another one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a piece of the puzzle,</v>

1082
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:38.990
<v Speaker 1>like it's good to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

1083
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.710
<v Speaker 1>develop your power and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1084
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:43.500
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something's moving around on you,</v>

1085
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it's giving you very different looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a,</v>

1086
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we do a lot of technical sparring,</v>

1087
00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with no gear on and stuff.</v>

1088
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 1>If you have these all these pads on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this false sense of security</v>

1089
00:44:54.751 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you get in there with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got nothing on and it's just like</v>

1090
00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.770
<v Speaker 1>feels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels almost your elbows and you're</v>

1091
00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 1>messing your feet up because you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned how to place things correctly</v>

1092
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and where they need to go and where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you maximize their damage and</v>

1093
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:12.240
<v Speaker 1>minimize yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a point of diminishing returns</v>

1094
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>though with a heavy bag were like a 300</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound bag and you're kicking it.</v>

1095
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not developing your power</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as even maybe a hundred 50 pound</v>

1096
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that make sense?</v>

1097
00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess it just depends on what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do and work on it and</v>

1098
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1099
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.630
<v Speaker 1>When you're hitting one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>immobile bags,</v>

1100
00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you concentrate on?</v>

1101
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Primarily?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Power power is just dig in.</v>

1102
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Just digging in as hard as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know that's going to be right</v>

1103
00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:39.420
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can close my eyes and hit this as hard</v>

1104
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:40.580
<v Speaker 1>as I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1105
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to worry so much about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>my balance and my speed,</v>

1106
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I can just blindly do this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1107
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 1>So just dig in and work on just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion.</v>

1108
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there,</v>

1109
00:45:50.461 --> 00:45:53.960
<v Speaker 1>isn't there some benefit in the bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>having some sort of a give so the year</v>

1110
00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 1>without pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

1111
00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean a lot of times when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on a speed and movement and</v>

1112
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really just try to like crack</v>

1113
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:04.500
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like touching his soul,</v>

1114
00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 1>work on a much lighter bag and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to work on my ankles and in the</v>

1115
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:11.010
<v Speaker 1>bag moving and targeting and those kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

1116
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very specific in what I'm trying to</v>

1117
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:16.180
<v Speaker 1>do and there's not just one way to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and.</v>

1118
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And then I think that's another thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that not a lot of people think about or</v>

1119
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:20.970
<v Speaker 1>or applies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1120
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna hit pads on.</v>

1121
00:46:21.951 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to hit the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why you're doing it?</v>

1122
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 1>What it is it that you're working on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you trying to develop?</v>

1123
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Because there's so many aspects to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1124
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 1>And it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's another thing that you just</v>

1125
00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 1>figure out over time.</v>

1126
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when the water bags</v>
<v Speaker 1>were?</v>

1127
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Big Deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big thing with those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a thick foam outer layer.</v>

1129
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Then there was water in it that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really catch on.</v>

1130
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.630
<v Speaker 1>We have an aqua bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little different.</v>

1131
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a little thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like rubber.</v>

1132
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 1>It's good for power punching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1133
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1134
00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Throw elbows because he gives in on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1135
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that it's very,</v>

1136
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:59.030
<v Speaker 1>it's very well put together so it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like given as much as you think</v>

1137
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:00.070
<v Speaker 1>it what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.670
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the misconceptions that you</v>

1139
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 1>think maybe even traditional martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists might have when they're looking</v>

1140
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:07.860
<v Speaker 1>at Moitai?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1141
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that it's really one dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1142
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have this kind of like,</v>

1143
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.010
<v Speaker 1>we think about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like the uh,</v>

1144
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was in a street fighter a real right</v>

1145
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 1>now the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saget old school,</v>

1146
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.870
<v Speaker 1>the old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boxer.</v>

1147
00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 1>When you think</v>

1148
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.250
<v Speaker 4>about Muay Thai fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just being this mindless,</v>

1149
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 4>like we're just gonna throw power at</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other and just stand there and we</v>

1150
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 4>have no thought process behind anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

1151
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:42.070
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely fighters who do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1152
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe to an outside observer that</v>

1153
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:49.490
<v Speaker 4>they might not see all the small details</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the complexity of the things they're</v>

1154
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because I'm standing in front of</v>

1155
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.110
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not moving doesn't mean there's no</v>

1156
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 4>thought behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1157
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 4>It's like I've learned how to use those</v>
<v Speaker 4>head movement and footwork things on a</v>

1158
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very small scale,</v>

1159
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.120
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to me I am.</v>

1160
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 4>I am doing a lot of movement and</v>
<v Speaker 4>footwork but,</v>

1161
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 4>but to an outside person and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing there mindlessly just winging</v>

1162
00:48:09.491 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 4>shots at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1163
00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:12.250
<v Speaker 4>so you don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see the,</v>

1164
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 4>all the complexity that goes into it</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I can watch it and view those</v>

1165
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:17.790
<v Speaker 4>things very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it one of those things where you're,</v>

1166
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.640
<v Speaker 3>you're watching like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1167
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.080
<v Speaker 3>if you're watching an mma fight for</v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1168
00:48:22.081 --> 00:48:24.870
<v Speaker 3>where a lot of times when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching mma you're watching someone</v>

1169
00:48:24.871 --> 00:48:28.680
<v Speaker 3>who's pretty good at a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things but not maybe</v>

1170
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.610
<v Speaker 3>technically proficient at any of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you,</v>

1171
00:48:31.611 --> 00:48:33.510
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing a lot of that where guys</v>

1172
00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:37.110
<v Speaker 3>are just kind of standing in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and almost playing Moitai</v>

1173
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.861
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1174
00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:38.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1175
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.370
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a high level fighter,</v>

1176
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.390
<v Speaker 3>do you guys watch mma and go fucking,</v>

1177
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.120
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean honestly,</v>

1178
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.520
<v Speaker 4>especially the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hits me really hard sometimes.</v>

1179
00:48:50.521 --> 00:48:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Like when we're like Friday night lion</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights where they're alive and then</v>

1180
00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 4>you're like watching whatever you have c</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>

1181
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.370
<v Speaker 4>whatever the car there is on and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on TV.</v>

1182
00:48:59.371 --> 00:49:00.420
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1183
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.873
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1184
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.530
<v Speaker 4>But there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is some good strikers in mma.</v>

1185
00:49:04.531 --> 00:49:06.360
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's guys like Barboza,</v>

1186
00:49:06.361 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 4>there's some pretty high level guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Joanna,</v>

1187
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.800
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1188
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Valentina Shevchenko.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:16.970
<v Speaker 4>But there's also a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 4>elements they have to think about take</v>

1190
00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.520
<v Speaker 4>downs and it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking about earlier,</v>

1191
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.230
<v Speaker 4>you got to implement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1192
00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:26.240
<v Speaker 4>what works for you and mma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

1193
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.650
<v Speaker 4>what works for you might not work for</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else either.</v>

1194
00:49:28.651 --> 00:49:30.660
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

1195
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:32.430
<v Speaker 4>it's really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's different now.</v>

1196
00:49:32.431 --> 00:49:34.440
<v Speaker 4>You at 24 years old,</v>

1197
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.930
<v Speaker 3>you've already have a very successful</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moitai career.</v>

1198
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought about doing her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>

1199
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:42.210
<v Speaker 4>So actually I just signed a deal with</v>
<v Speaker 4>belt or oh,</v>

1200
00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure I'm making the transition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1201
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.710
<v Speaker 4>not only with mma I wanted to do Moitai</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep doing more tie with lion fight,</v>

1202
00:49:49.711 --> 00:49:51.320
<v Speaker 4>but that has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1203
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:55.710
<v Speaker 4>that hasn't worked out so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to be doing kickboxing and</v>

1204
00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.570
<v Speaker 4>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that worked out.</v>

1205
00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1206
00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.210
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going the different route so</v>

1207
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not gonna work to promote and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fight or you know,</v>

1208
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 4>through what lion fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Scott Coker is gonna,</v>

1209
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has signed me in that.</v>

1210
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.000
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be able to work both</v>
<v Speaker 4>angles with me.</v>

1211
00:50:12.001 --> 00:50:13.500
<v Speaker 4>So that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna be really good.</v>

1212
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a guy who clenches a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1213
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:20.090
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great thing for mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about for kickboxing?</v>

1214
00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to do bell to our</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing as well because I know that</v>

1215
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:24.190
<v Speaker 3>bell towards doing a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing right now.</v>

1216
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of combining kickboxing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mma on the same card.</v>

1217
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Has Anybody talked to them about</v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoning the kickboxing aspect and</v>

1218
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:34.070
<v Speaker 3>just doing moy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tai,</v>

1219
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1220
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I've said some things to Scott about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think they're just trying to</v>

1221
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:45.280
<v Speaker 2>establish that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kickboxing side of their,</v>

1222
00:50:45.281 --> 00:50:47.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their cards and uh,</v>

1223
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 2>hopefully one day he might bring in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

1224
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:51.404
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1225
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the belt or kickboxing can be more</v>

1226
00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:57.800
<v Speaker 2>of a standalone promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1227
00:50:57.801 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be able to venture out into</v>

1228
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 2>mixing the cars and maybe have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights on the owner corridor in between</v>

1229
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 2>fights as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1230
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for now I think they're just trying</v>

1231
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:09.280
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1232
00:51:09.281 --> 00:51:11.410
<v Speaker 2>to start out and do things right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>build up that,</v>

1233
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.420
<v Speaker 2>that portion of it and having those</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed cards where it's the uh,</v>

1234
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 2>built or in my me and the bill or</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing,</v>

1235
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.040
<v Speaker 2>which has worked out very well and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think people really enjoy it because</v>

1236
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:19.874
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1237
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.790
<v Speaker 2>we're having both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both fights on the card,</v>

1238
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:24.320
<v Speaker 2>but eventually I'd be nice if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1239
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 2>the kickboxing can stand alone and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of developed from there.</v>

1240
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just seems to me that it doesn't make</v>

1241
00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:32.500
<v Speaker 3>any sense to eliminate elbows and knees</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1242
00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:34.520
<v Speaker 3>it seemed kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1243
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:35.800
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different sport,</v>

1244
00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.870
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1245
00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's striking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1246
00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:41.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're kicking like,</v>

1247
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Speaker 3>why aren't you elbowing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why don't you need.</v>

1248
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.730
<v Speaker 3>I can say I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful.</v>

1249
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think the more complex striking</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets,</v>

1250
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.790
<v Speaker 3>the more beautiful it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1251
00:51:51.791 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 3>the more variables that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I watch a guy like Sanchez,</v>

1252
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:59.770
<v Speaker 3>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's such a wild guy to watch,</v>

1253
00:51:59.771 --> 00:52:04.771
<v Speaker 3>he's so he fights his own very</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular style and he's very light on</v>

1254
00:52:05.111 --> 00:52:07.570
<v Speaker 3>his feet as a lot of switching of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

1255
00:52:07.571 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 3>A lot of kicks that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1256
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 3>you don't know where they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think they're going low and they kind of</v>

1257
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.700
<v Speaker 3>come straight up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi Kevin Fault.</v>

1258
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Sanjay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>

1259
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.433
<v Speaker 3>when you play,</v>

1260
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.200
<v Speaker 2>when was that standard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>

1261
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.420
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eleven or 12?</v>

1262
00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>August 2012.</v>

1263
00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.500
<v Speaker 2>It was right before you moved to CSA?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1264
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.800

1265
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.790
<v Speaker 3>the CSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was that?</v>

1266
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.150
<v Speaker 3>How was fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1269
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 2>So it was a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to describe what it was like,</v>

00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:40.540
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1271
00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:44.960

<v Speaker 2>mentally that,</v>

1272
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 2>that I've looked back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And they're doing that.</v>

1275
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just so like I was in another</v>

<v Speaker 3>we're talking.</v>

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I want you to see looks after the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Cecil people's as a referee.</v>

1282
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kinda did it.</v>

1283
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who saw that comment?</v>

1284
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Did he do that thing where he lifts his</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee up and does the karate thing at the</v>

1285
00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:16.120
<v Speaker 3>beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to watch that.</v>

1286
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:18.970
<v Speaker 3>That shit's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did he become the person to see</v>

1287
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.730
<v Speaker 3>people's is a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say that.</v>

1288
00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:23.440
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see this high.</v>

1289
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it goes.</v>

1290
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 3>The take that he does</v>

1291
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.990
<v Speaker 1>that weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neat thing that he does,</v>

1292
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.371
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sanchez,</v>

1293
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't fight like a traditional Thai</v>

1294
00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best fighter of all time.</v>

1295
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Arguably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1296
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.270
<v Speaker 1>he's certainly one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1297
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:43.280
<v Speaker 1>he uses so many things from different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different arts and taekwondo and Moy</v>

1298
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Thai and kickboxing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got really sneaky left leg to man</v>

1299
00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It literally comes straight up and it's</v>

1300
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:54.750
<v Speaker 1>one that you have no idea where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

1301
00:53:54.751 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It might be a front kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leg kick,</v>

1302
00:53:56.671 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 1>body kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>head kick.</v>

1303
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew he was going to kick me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't aware of the hell it was</v>

1304
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 1>going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really good.</v>

1305
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 1>If you ever seen Lawrence tensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdowns of Muay Thai fights,</v>

1306
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

1307
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 1>what is the name of them on Youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to see if you can</v>

1308
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

1309
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I've seen one guys deal with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdowns in there.</v>

1310
00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know if it's the same.</v>

1311
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I think Lawrence just does them under</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>

1312
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really,</v>

1313
00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 1>really smart guy and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really aware of,</v>

1314
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:25.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of more Thai and really aware of the</v>

1315
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 1>complexities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did a breakdown on San shy and</v>

1316
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Sanchez setting up</v>
<v Speaker 1>high kicks and the way he,</v>

1317
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 1>he'll sort of test you with some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks and then he's got that really</v>

1318
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:41.070
<v Speaker 1>unusual way of throwing his kicks to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they literally come straight up.</v>

1319
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:41.904
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

1320
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back to that fight.</v>

1321
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to change some of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and that's Kinda what we were</v>

1322
00:54:47.491 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 1>speaking of earlier in the gym is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that one thing he's kicked butt,</v>

1323
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 1>but he has so many ways and variables to</v>
<v Speaker 1>set that up as far as speed.</v>

1324
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.320
<v Speaker 1>And so he uses all these things to test</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and once he figures that out,</v>

1325
00:54:58.321 --> 00:55:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he's able to destroy</v>

1326
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 1>basically everyone at every level of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport because he has so many answers to</v>

1327
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.310
<v Speaker 1>that one question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You beat him,</v>

1328
00:55:08.311 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 1>didn't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a split decision,</v>

1329
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:11.610
<v Speaker 1>split decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I feel it?</v>

1330
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kieran saying you want some people think</v>

1331
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.200
<v Speaker 1>that if I didn't get dropped but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dropped one.</v>

1332
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cecil commercials got you with a bad</v>

1333
00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.750
<v Speaker 1>count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1334
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it was a split,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1335
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1336
00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1337
00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ironic having cecil peoples</v>

1338
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 1>be the referee in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Moitai fight because he's a</v>

1339
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:36.330
<v Speaker 1>people's is one of those guys that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't stop people with leg</v>

1340
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 1>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like one of his quotes.</v>

1341
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the bad decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went down where he's like,</v>

1342
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.930
<v Speaker 1>leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stop.</v>

1343
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Fights went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1344
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 1>were you allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about fighting is you have</v>

1345
00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:53.070
<v Speaker 1>people regulating these arts who have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea about them whatsoever.</v>

1346
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant issue with the UFC.</v>

1347
00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant issue with judging and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would imagine with tie it's even more</v>

1348
00:55:58.921 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 1>difficult to find competent judges and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1349
00:56:02.011 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting boxing judges doing,</v>

1350
00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you're getting karate guys doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moitai and these are the people who are</v>

1351
00:56:10.381 --> 00:56:14.130
<v Speaker 1>basically controlling the outcomes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fights if there's no stoppage.</v>

1352
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

1353
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:16.254
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1354
00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:18.600
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy in Thailand.</v>

1355
00:56:18.601 --> 00:56:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking sneaky.</v>

1356
00:56:19.591 --> 00:56:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got man in Thailand.</v>

1357
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1358
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.620
<v Speaker 1>how do they approach the clench because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen in this fight like cecil is</v>

1359
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 1>breaking guys up almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you tie up.</v>

1360
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.273
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1361
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it's such a complex thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the fact.</v>

1363
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Are these guys working well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

1364
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a deep understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

1365
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge it or ref it accurately.</v>

1366
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just a matter of time is</v>

1367
00:56:47.901 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not a matter of people moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1368
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.690
<v Speaker 1>It's what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they affecting each other?</v>

1369
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Are they hurting each other or they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindlessly like lifting your legs up to</v>

1370
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 1>appear to stay busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where if somebody doesn't know that me</v>

1371
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 1>just lifting my leg up and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well he's staying busy,</v>

1372
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 1>he's active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they breaking them up?</v>

1373
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 1>But I wasn't really doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just screwing like a lot of times</v>

1374
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:07.160
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1375
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let you guys work in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clench,</v>

1376
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but they just let like you're not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and they just let it go and not</v>

1377
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:17.140
<v Speaker 1>not knowing when people are stalling out</v>
<v Speaker 1>or trying to buy time or just just</v>

1378
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:20.140
<v Speaker 1>moving their legs for the sake of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking like they're actually needing</v>

1379
00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:24.190
<v Speaker 1>each other and the and these judges in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these reps don't have an understanding</v>

1380
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:24.610
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1381
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 1>That's an issue with ground fighting as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1382
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It's an issue of course the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when certain fights go to the ground,</v>

1383
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.800
<v Speaker 1>whether it's judging or whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>even refereeing like some guys are</v>

1384
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:35.620
<v Speaker 1>setting up certain positions and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the referee will come up and stand them</v>

1385
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 1>up like that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guys,</v>

1386
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.920
<v Speaker 1>they're working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting,</v>

1387
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think that in a clinch as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times they separate</v>

1388
00:57:42.201 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 1>guides from the clench when two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're clenching up and they're both</v>

1389
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.940
<v Speaker 1>working to try to establish dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

1390
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.440
<v Speaker 1>one is eventually maybe going to win</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dominant position battle and that's</v>

1391
00:57:53.441 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 1>part of the grind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the grind is a guy in posing</v>

1392
00:57:56.141 --> 00:58:00.310
<v Speaker 1>your skillset as well as conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the above on his opponent and if you</v>

1393
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:02.740
<v Speaker 1>just get in and separate that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to watch a knockout.</v>

1394
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of diluting the sport and</v>

1395
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how much,</v>

1396
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 1>how many fights you've watched or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many courses you've taken.</v>

1397
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't done this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've never fought before,</v>

1398
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going on in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>

1399
00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have people,</v>

1400
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.910
<v Speaker 1>even if they've been in the sport for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time,</v>

1401
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it may have been around it for a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

1402
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 1>If you've never fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at some level,</v>

1403
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going on and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing it,</v>

1404
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:30.820
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really don't know what you're</v>

1405
00:58:30.821 --> 00:58:32.800
<v Speaker 1>saying right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how much of it is</v>

1406
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:36.850
<v Speaker 1>actually effective and how much of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that actually just absorbing</v>

1407
00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:38.580
<v Speaker 1>things and blocking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>

1408
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so complex and I think that's one</v>

1409
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:44.080
<v Speaker 1>of the things that gets lost about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting arts in general,</v>

1410
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but more tie in particular is all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity that goes on.</v>

1411
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what you were saying that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that misconception is that they</v>

1412
00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.700
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two guys that are just bruisers yeah,</v>

1413
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.040
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm watching here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching all this complex</v>

1414
00:58:57.041 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 1>interactions of footwork kicks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elbows and knees and clenching and and</v>

1415
00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:06.050
<v Speaker 1>knowing when to time things and dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a really high level opponent is</v>

1416
00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 1>very crafty and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sort of calculating all this stuff</v>

1417
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:11.810
<v Speaker 1>in his head as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the problem with,</v>

1419
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 1>there's only so much you can learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>

1420
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 1>There's only so much you can learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching videos until you apply those</v>

1421
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1422
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 3>street smart and book smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have that street knowledge,</v>

1423
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1424
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:29.690
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your knowledge is very limited,</v>

1425
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:30.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1426
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 3>and so I don't care how much you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1427
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 3>if you've never applied it even or even</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them just like sparring.</v>

1428
00:59:38.301 --> 00:59:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how much you spar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1429
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 3>until you get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what it's like</v>

1430
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:44.913
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the case with a lot of</v>

1432
00:59:46.971 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I even joke about golf because I</v>

1433
00:59:49.641 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 3>think golf is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I get the people that do it a lot to</v>

1434
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:57.140
<v Speaker 3>them it must be complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they must understand all the</v>

1435
00:59:57.141 --> 01:00:00.980
<v Speaker 3>different aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say that about playing pool to</v>

1436
01:00:00.981 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an art form.</v>

1437
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.800
<v Speaker 3>It's only interesting for people to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and I think that's one of the things</v>

1438
01:00:06.801 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 3>that's cool about going to like what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing here,</v>

1439
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:13.280
<v Speaker 3>this is a small arena or small crowd who</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean it looks like there's only like</v>

1440
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 3>four or 500 people and that whole place</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that kind of shit.</v>

1441
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's you world championship caliber</v>

1442
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 3>fighter fighting another world</v>
<v Speaker 3>championship caliber fighter.</v>

1443
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Both guys in their prime and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting in front of 50 people,</v>

1444
01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1445
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:32.450
<v Speaker 3>but it's been a couple of books and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>super complex.</v>

1446
01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean what's going on is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1447
01:00:34.221 --> 01:00:38.030
<v Speaker 3>this exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interactions and I think one of the</v>

1448
01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>things about having guys like Lawrence</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenshin putting out these videos and a</v>

1449
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 3>lot of other people that have done these</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous breakdown videos with Moitai</v>

1450
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:49.220
<v Speaker 3>is that people that are fans mean even</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't train themselves,</v>

1451
01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:52.790
<v Speaker 3>even if they just watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can see things now that it may be</v>

1452
01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:56.210
<v Speaker 3>perhaps they wouldn't have seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then appreciate what these athletes</v>

1453
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:58.150
<v Speaker 3>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people that watch</v>

1454
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't fucking play football at all,</v>

1455
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 3>but they can enjoy it and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing that in this,</v>

1456
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and watching the flow.</v>

1457
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that where he called a knockdown?</v>

1458
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he got right back up.</v>

1459
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:14.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean why was that a knock down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he got kicked in the head,</v>

1460
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.250
<v Speaker 3>shoulder carrying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to talk,</v>

1461
01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you've got to talk on the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1462
01:01:20.691 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

1463
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I told you you were going to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1464
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you get a Goddamn chair?</v>

1465
01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Because Jamie was still on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>microphone.</v>

1466
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.733
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the one thing.</v>

1467
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:31.880
<v Speaker 3>This one thing that's lost that hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>been discussed is because Kevin doesn't</v>

1468
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:34.520
<v Speaker 3>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to this day and how long ago was this</v>

1469
01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 3>fight for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four years ago.</v>

1470
01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 3>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only time that the WBC has</v>

1471
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:42.530
<v Speaker 3>ever sanctioned at diamond belt fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a Moitai fight.</v>

1472
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Was that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it means is that in boxing,</v>

1473
01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 3>when you have two great fighters from</v>
<v Speaker 3>two different weight classes that meet</v>

1474
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 3>at a catch weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make it a diamond belt fight and</v>

1475
01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 3>they put a real diamonds on the belt and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the epitome of the WBC title.</v>

1476
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only time in the history of</v>

1477
01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:59.080
<v Speaker 3>the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The WBC made a diamond belt for a Moitai</v>

1478
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.580
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what a watershed moment this</v>

1479
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:05.330
<v Speaker 3>fight was for Moitai in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1480
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:06.223
<v Speaker 3>Go sit down.</v>

1481
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.260
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No frill.</v>

1482
01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:18.890
<v Speaker 3>And also just important because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>rare that you see guys of this caliber</v>

1483
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>going</v>

1484
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>at it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1485
01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>it's super exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

1486
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worse than shy fighting.</v>

1487
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Now he's starting to do mma isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1488
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>he was calling out conor mcgregor for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second just to get a little like they're</v>

1489
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>talking about stuff and doing stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1490
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>but will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually helped me when they talked</v>

1491
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>about Macau do on mma for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was trained in a little bit,</v>

1492
01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is he going to actually do it?</v>

1493
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1494
01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1495
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about Thai fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're really good in the</v>

1496
01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>clinch and taking people down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1497
01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>and really good at avoiding being taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1498
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of people don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much similarities there are when it</v>

1499
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:59.870
<v Speaker 1>comes to the clench and wrestling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo and you know,</v>

1500
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I went and trained with the black veil</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo team in San Jose before I had a</v>

1501
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>shoot boxing fight and they just could</v>
<v Speaker 1>not believe that I could hang with their</v>

1502
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>high level black belts.</v>

1503
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1504
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all this kind of similar stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

1505
01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:13.770
<v Speaker 1>your setups might be a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1506
01:03:13.771 --> 01:03:17.460
<v Speaker 1>but all the fundamentals that go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>more Thai clinch are very similar to a,</v>

1507
01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:20.640
<v Speaker 1>to judo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a difference of things you can</v>

1508
01:03:20.641 --> 01:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and cannot do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1509
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:24.360
<v Speaker 1>but the base in the fundamentals of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>go across the board.</v>

1510
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that a lot with,</v>

1511
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with sweeps and trips and like you see</v>

1512
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>some really interesting trips and sweeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Moitai that are really very,</v>

1513
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:37.460
<v Speaker 1>very technical about manipulating guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Setting them up in one direction and</v>

1514
01:03:37.461 --> 01:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>changing direction on them and throwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to the ground.</v>

1515
01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.860
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool stuff to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the stuff in the tight clench</v>

1516
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>is very similar to a greco wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1517
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>a all upper body a throws and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can't shoot in,</v>

1518
01:03:50.231 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 1>but everything we can do is above the</v>
<v Speaker 1>waist and in those kind of manipulations</v>

1519
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 1>and off balancing.</v>

1520
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's why like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I just do Greco wrestling,</v>

1521
01:03:58.471 --> 01:03:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do pretty well,</v>

1522
01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are often surprised by how</v>

1523
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 1>well my wrestling or Jujitsu is if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>just messing around and doing it because</v>

1524
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.540
<v Speaker 1>there's so many similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1525
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:09.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1526
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're watching fights in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>

1527
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:17.090
<v Speaker 1>they judge the clench is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important part of the fight.</v>

1528
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in America when you're looking at</v>

1529
01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the clench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of it the same way.</v>

1530
01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:26.160
<v Speaker 1>We look at a clench in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are just stalling.</v>

1531
01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1532
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a way to dominate and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and show your strength and ability over</v>

1533
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>over your opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1534
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>and if you can control someone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage them and then in laying these</v>

1535
01:04:38.221 --> 01:04:41.430
<v Speaker 1>clean knees on someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's showing your superiority over them,</v>

1536
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1537
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.220
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said here,</v>

1538
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a good understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1539
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just viewed as,</v>

1540
01:04:48.661 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

1541
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just resting or they're just,</v>

1542
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing anything in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1543
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When guys take guys down and Moy,</v>

1544
01:04:55.211 --> 01:04:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Tai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much does that count?</v>

1545
01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Like how are they scoring fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously knockdowns or critical,</v>

1546
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:03.300
<v Speaker 1>but if you dump a guy a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you sweep them and trip,</v>

1547
01:05:03.301 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to slam on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of a factor is that an in a</v>

1548
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be a huge factor if they're</v>

1549
01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>scoring these correctly because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing your,</v>

1550
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>your balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dominancy are in your control is,</v>

1551
01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1552
01:05:16.351 --> 01:05:18.920
<v Speaker 1>so being able to throw someone in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and,</v>

1553
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:20.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

1554
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>you're still just standing there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is huge.</v>

1555
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>A huge scoring thing is how you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it important because like what if you</v>

1556
01:05:26.501 --> 01:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>just get double under hooks and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>crush them towards you and just send</v>

1557
01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>them over and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many factors that go into it.</v>

1559
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a,</v>

1560
01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>a judge or a ref that basically has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very elementary understanding of this</v>

1561
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't give you an accurate,</v>

1562
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>a judge of this or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or an accurate reading of this because</v>

1563
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1564
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their knowledge isn't so deep.</v>

1565
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1566
01:05:56.141 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me watching a,</v>

1567
01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>a Jujitsu match and trying to score it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can kind kindness,</v>

1568
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:03.010
<v Speaker 1>score it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't be able to if I spent my</v>

1569
01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:05.050
<v Speaker 1>life in the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying,</v>

1570
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>what I'm kind of getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was style points by five points,</v>

1571
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1572
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.160
<v Speaker 1>And cool something dope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1573
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.810
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweep them on his bad side,</v>

1574
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>somebody and seamlessly do it and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it look like nothing as opposed to I'm</v>

1575
01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:20.170
<v Speaker 1>like falling on top of them and we both</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose their balance.</v>

1576
01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1577
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:21.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1578
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to like objectively</v>

1579
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:24.820
<v Speaker 1>call though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1580
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Judging is such a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough man.</v>

1582
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'll be the first one to admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated thing.</v>

1583
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:32.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just fighting my,</v>

1584
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1585
01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it and then I'm thinking,</v>

1586
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:39.220
<v Speaker 1>trying to think of it from the mentality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of someone that's never done this before</v>

1587
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>or only taken like a course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1588
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 1>how can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you do that?</v>

1589
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time doing it and I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent 15 years doing this sport and</v>

1590
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>you had a controversial loss in lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1591
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought crump.</v>

1592
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Ed Tie with over a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

1593
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:59.170
<v Speaker 1>And that was your first loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my first loss that I didn't</v>

1594
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>think you lost that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They overturn it.</v>

1595
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 1>They did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 1>For Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 never happened.</v>

1597
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 1>So 18 judges from all around the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1598
01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1599
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>

1600
01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I still don't because I had a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and I put everything on the line.</v>

1601
01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1602
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought I did the best that I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1603
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:19.720
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some things that I think</v>

1604
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I could've done better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a great fight,</v>

1605
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a close fight,</v>

1606
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:24.910
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought you won.</v>

1607
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.690
<v Speaker 1>And I watched and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

1608
01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:27.610
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1609
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I remember Pat Miletich and Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chevelle,</v>

1610
01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>we're both saying they thought it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad decision.</v>

1611
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'll watch it again and I</v>

1612
01:07:33.691 --> 01:07:33.911
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1613
01:07:33.911 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch it one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1614
01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:37.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a bad decision.</v>

1615
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And I remember now that you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1616
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>overturned.</v>

1617
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe they brought it up on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcast afterwards,</v>

1618
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>during your next wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened?</v>

1619
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that when they brought it up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm making this up.</v>

1620
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It was the next event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't fighting on it,</v>

1621
01:07:50.321 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>but they broke up and I was on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcast.</v>

1622
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that rare that they overturn a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1623
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:56.194
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1624
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never seen it.</v>

1626
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's such a tough thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially especially in a fight that</v>

1627
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like so lopsided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1628
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.800
<v Speaker 1>relatively close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of how,</v>

1629
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.480
<v Speaker 1>how you're viewing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>

1630
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:12.910
<v Speaker 1>what you're giving more or less credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1631
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like a simple thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the outside.</v>

1632
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1633
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>he hit him more or while he rocked him</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1634
01:08:18.111 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so many levels to.</v>

1635
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:21.770
<v Speaker 2>This is Kinda like we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

1636
01:08:21.771 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an on or off thing,</v>

1637
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a dial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1638
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:30.080
<v Speaker 2>In and unless you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even tell how much impact this</v>

1639
01:08:30.081 --> 01:08:32.440
<v Speaker 2>is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much it's really hurting you,</v>

1640
01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the outset.</v>

1641
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is especially like for the ties to</v>

1642
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:40.670
<v Speaker 2>have that stone cold face where</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's affecting them because you</v>

1643
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 2>don't really know this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you just get crushed with a,</v>

1644
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:45.570
<v Speaker 2>with a right hand and they didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>move or,</v>

1645
01:08:45.571 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 2>or show anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it very difficult for for a</v>

1646
01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 2>judge to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1647
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>this punch should get this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amount of credit or this much</v>

1648
01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>credit as opposed to just that pit or</v>
<v Speaker 2>pet stuff so you know it.</v>

1649
01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.550
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult thing to do and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do correctly and accurately because</v>

1650
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.460
<v Speaker 2>there's so many variables and so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>things you're seeing or not seeing.</v>

1651
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Depending on where you're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you're viewing it.</v>

1652
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're out there,</v>

1653
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:09.980
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the left side of learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right side of the ring,</v>

1654
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.250
<v Speaker 2>there's there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too complex a thing to.</v>

1655
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.890
<v Speaker 2>That's why I could never say anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a decision.</v>

1656
01:09:15.891 --> 01:09:16.724
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1657
01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:21.130
<v Speaker 2>it's such a difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless it was so one sided.</v>

1658
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how in any way could you view this?</v>

1659
01:09:23.391 --> 01:09:25.400
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if any fight is relatively close,</v>

1660
01:09:25.401 --> 01:09:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how you can complain really</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the decision because no matter</v>

1661
01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you're going to be on one side</v>

1662
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.830
<v Speaker 2>of it and sometimes you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of it where maybe you</v>

1663
01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:36.080
<v Speaker 2>didn't win and they gave it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1664
01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:39.150
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I love about talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fighters and especially about putting</v>

1665
01:09:39.151 --> 01:09:44.151
<v Speaker 3>on a podcast is I think it gives people</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impression of fighters that like a</v>

1666
01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:49.350
<v Speaker 3>similar impression to what I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people have the wrong</v>

1667
01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.240
<v Speaker 3>impression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this impression that fighters</v>

1668
01:09:51.241 --> 01:09:52.110
<v Speaker 3>are all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1669
01:09:52.111 --> 01:09:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there to fuck the world and kick</v>

1670
01:09:55.051 --> 01:09:58.200
<v Speaker 3>ass and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really the very best fighters are</v>

1671
01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:02.100
<v Speaker 3>almost all very intelligent and very</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex people.</v>

1672
01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.880
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do when you fight,</v>

1673
01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:10.320
<v Speaker 3>when you compete is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like a representative of your focus.</v>

1674
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the stuff that you had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do to get to that moment,</v>

1675
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.240
<v Speaker 3>especially after you've done it a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>times and you're aware of all the</v>

1676
01:10:18.241 --> 01:10:22.530
<v Speaker 3>demands and you've really risen to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasion on more than one time and you</v>

1677
01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:24.600
<v Speaker 3>realize like all the variables that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in it,</v>

1678
01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool talking to you guys and,</v>

1679
01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:29.880
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and going over that stuff.</v>

1680
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:31.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people that are</v>

1681
01:10:31.741 --> 01:10:34.330
<v Speaker 3>listening right now and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking guys are sharp like this.</v>

1682
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on to this that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't think.</v>

1683
01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:40.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a thing that you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see the whole thing.</v>

1684
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

1685
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.660
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when it comes to fighting,</v>

1686
01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:49.661
<v Speaker 2>you're viewing 15 minutes of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone put their entire life into.</v>

1687
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:56.110
<v Speaker 2>You judge them on this very small</v>
<v Speaker 2>fraction of a moment in their life in</v>

1688
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.000
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why fighting is one of the,</v>

1689
01:10:59.001 --> 01:11:04.001
<v Speaker 2>I think more stressful sporting things</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do because we put so much into</v>

1690
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 2>such a little thing that is viewed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the only thing we're judged on</v>

1691
01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:12.260
<v Speaker 2>were not judged by how hard we train or</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do we kill ourselves or the</v>

1692
01:11:12.261 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 2>things we've had overcome and the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

1693
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>what you did on that day in that moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how how you came across it means</v>

1694
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1695
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Whereas other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other other ways around it and</v>

1696
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:24.451
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1697
01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:25.860
<v Speaker 1>you could have a bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tomorrow you're going to have a</v>

1698
01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>better day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1699
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>this is the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the only day and not the only</v>

1700
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:31.490
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen minutes or half an hour,</v>

1701
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>football that where there is a season</v>

1702
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll make it up the next game.</v>

1703
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:38.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't really truly understand how</v>

1704
01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>much goes into this and how much we put</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all I can say.</v>

1705
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Every bad judges and bad reps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's life and death.</v>

1706
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you are literally have my life in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands and you are incompetent.</v>

1707
01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the UFC you lose three</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1708
01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You get cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes twice.</v>

1709
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1710
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean depending upon,</v>

1711
01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:58.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of variables that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that,</v>

1712
01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:03.210
<v Speaker 1>but what fighting is to me the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>always like to describe it as high level</v>

1713
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>problem solving with dire physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1714
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And so when you watch someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely sensational at it,</v>

1715
01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:11.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you watch an Anderson Silva in</v>

1716
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 1>his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see some guy who's just figured out</v>

1717
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:17.730
<v Speaker 1>a way through this puzzle and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really extraordinary way.</v>

1718
01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a beauty to that that I,</v>

1719
01:12:20.581 --> 01:12:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people that really love and</v>

1720
01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:27.330
<v Speaker 1>appreciate fighting can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can understand it and can feel it and</v>

1721
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:32.331
<v Speaker 1>see it and I always want to try to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to express that to other people.</v>

1722
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see what I'm seeing?</v>

1723
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you saw what I'm seeing,</v>

1724
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fucking freaking out just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

1725
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough man.</v>

1726
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like he said,</v>

1727
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have experience in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport or I've trained or fought in</v>

1728
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:48.720
<v Speaker 1>yourself like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't appreciate it as much as</v>

1729
01:12:48.721 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 1>someone who hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just viewing it from the outside,</v>

1730
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1731
01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what goes into this,</v>

1732
01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard it is,</v>

1733
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it feels like to get hit and you</v>

1734
01:12:57.151 --> 01:12:58.380
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it feels like to,</v>

1735
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 1>to have to come these obstacles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and preparing yourself for a</v>

1736
01:13:02.221 --> 01:13:04.370
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just this surface thing like</v>

1737
01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 1>two guys in the ring in there fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and silver and it's done.</v>

1738
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.950
<v Speaker 1>When you saw there was some recent event</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

1739
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

1740
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:15.570
<v Speaker 1>NBC or whoever was putting it into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spent hundreds of millions of</v>

1741
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:18.480
<v Speaker 1>dollars on boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a few events,</v>

1742
01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.990
<v Speaker 1>they'd lost a shitload of money and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>

1743
01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It's out and it falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched something like that.</v>

1744
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

1745
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>they put so much effort into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they just put together a fucking</v>

1746
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:36.681
<v Speaker 1>stacked Moitai card just to stacked one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just let people know.</v>

1747
01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I put it on prime time tv just like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with Fox,</v>

1748
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:42.840
<v Speaker 1>with the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you can't miss.</v>

1749
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1750
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the product is there,</v>

1751
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>the talent is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1752
01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 1>the fighters were established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much high level talent.</v>

1753
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean when anybody watches Moitai even</v>
<v Speaker 1>in on tv live,</v>

1754
01:13:56.071 --> 01:13:58.800
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just fall in love with it as,</v>

1755
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.810
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're where has,</v>

1756
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>where's the spin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Where's this bed's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:07.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fan of exciting shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be a fan of time.</v>

1759
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.093
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1760
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said earlier,</v>

1761
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>there's so many variables that go into</v>

1762
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>it and it's just a matter of the Dole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those right pieces coming together at</v>

1763
01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:19.210
<v Speaker 2>the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like when the UFC really</v>

1764
01:14:19.211 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 2>started blowing up with Stephan Bonner</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forrest griffin fight,</v>

1765
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 2>like how long had it been around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many amazing fights had been going</v>

1766
01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>on and it was just that the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right people,</v>

1767
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:32.170
<v Speaker 2>the right thing blew it up.</v>

1768
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 12 years old.</v>

1769
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.300
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people forget he was 12 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old when that happened.</v>

1770
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.460
<v Speaker 2>How long did they struggle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money they lose,</v>

1771
01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:42.440
<v Speaker 2>like how many promotions came and went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing with Moitai.</v>

1772
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just you don't know what the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>combination and the right time is and</v>

1773
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:50.460
<v Speaker 2>hopefully one day those all those pieces</v>
<v Speaker 2>will come together.</v>

1774
01:14:50.461 --> 01:14:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1775
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:53.700
<v Speaker 2>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just doing the best we can with</v>

1776
01:14:53.701 --> 01:14:54.534
<v Speaker 2>what we have.</v>

1777
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you as a fighter and you're 34 now,</v>

1778
01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.270
<v Speaker 3>36,</v>
<v Speaker 3>36.</v>

1779
01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:00.710
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1780
01:15:00.711 --> 01:15:02.840
<v Speaker 3>when you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>

1781
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:03.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1782
01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:07.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a window Sanchez 36 to where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a window,</v>

1783
01:15:07.701 --> 01:15:11.840
<v Speaker 3>there's like what your body is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>function at the level that it's at right</v>

1784
01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.720
<v Speaker 3>now for a certain amount of time and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more.</v>

1785
01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that,</v>

1786
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.690
<v Speaker 3>does that fuck with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that,</v>

1787
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about them,</v>

1788
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1789
01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.530
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1790
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:25.010
<v Speaker 2>after I had two really bad losses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost my,</v>

1791
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:28.010
<v Speaker 2>lost my world title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1792
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.740
<v Speaker 2>by stoppage and then I got knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next fight I was really struggling</v>

1793
01:15:31.741 --> 01:15:34.290
<v Speaker 2>mentally with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of things like,</v>

1794
01:15:34.291 --> 01:15:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I still do this?</v>

1795
01:15:35.761 --> 01:15:37.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too old to do this.</v>

1796
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:39.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had all these questions in my head</v>

1797
01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.210
<v Speaker 2>and what I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Karen helped me realize right</v>

1798
01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:45.900
<v Speaker 2>before I won that a wmc title in Peru</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1799
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I've had all these questions from day</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1800
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm too old to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm good enough,</v>

1801
01:15:50.131 --> 01:15:52.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my answer has always been the same.</v>

1802
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Do I love to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1803
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Can I physically still do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1804
01:15:56.071 --> 01:15:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Well then I'm going to do the best that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can and give this everything that I</v>

1805
01:15:58.831 --> 01:16:01.200
<v Speaker 2>have and that's not going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's going to be over</v>

1806
01:16:01.201 --> 01:16:02.280
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>

1807
01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:04.200
<v Speaker 2>10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1808
01:16:04.201 --> 01:16:08.970
<v Speaker 2>So as long as I'm physically able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and as long as I still have a love</v>

1809
01:16:08.971 --> 01:16:10.590
<v Speaker 2>and a passion for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep doing it.</v>

1810
01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have been asking me how long I'm</v>

1811
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:14.910
<v Speaker 2>going to keep doing this for over 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1812
01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.550
<v Speaker 3>The old expression that a fighter lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dies in their own mind,</v>

1813
01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you're at your best,</v>

1814
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:22.540
<v Speaker 3>like you were telling me when you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>

1815
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.870
<v Speaker 3>you felt invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1816
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:25.130
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1817
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 3>you're confident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pull the trigger faster,</v>

1818
01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:33.220
<v Speaker 3>you have more belief in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're saying I'm just gonna do my</v>

1819
01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.820
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you,</v>

1820
01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.390
<v Speaker 3>when is there a thing in your head that</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1821
01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:40.030
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was in that state where I felt</v>

1822
01:16:40.031 --> 01:16:42.310
<v Speaker 3>invincible or does that not matter?</v>

1823
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely does.</v>

1824
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there there's a point where thinking</v>

1825
01:16:49.461 --> 01:16:51.410
<v Speaker 2>you're invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can backfire.</v>

1826
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1827
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:53.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about like Tyson course,</v>

1828
01:16:53.761 --> 01:16:54.590
<v Speaker 2>he was invincible,</v>

1829
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:57.530
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as he lost that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1830
01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:01.250
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't overcome it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard Tyson talk about</v>

1831
01:17:01.251 --> 01:17:04.340
<v Speaker 3>what was going through his mind when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was walking to the ring?</v>

1832
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard them do that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard him do it?</v>

1833
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1834
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I've played that like 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it to that shit up because</v>

1835
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:18.330
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that where it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so raw and it's honest.</v>

1836
01:17:18.331 --> 01:17:20.350
<v Speaker 3>It's after he had been retired and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1837
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:24.980
<v Speaker 3>and he had just kind of reflecting about</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the nerves that would go through his</v>

1838
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:29.981
<v Speaker 3>mind and all the Geckos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most guys are pretty much intimidated.</v>

1839
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 3>They lost the fight before flooding got</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>

1840
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Most Guy I knew I needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to doug.</v>

1841
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys know how to beat these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys psychologically.</v>

1842
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 3>He finally got in the ring with them.</v>

1843
01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:45.560
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I come into come into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ring,</v>

1844
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:46.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm globe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No stop.</v>

1845
01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.270
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While I'm in the dressing room five</v>

1846
01:17:51.271 --> 01:17:53.910
<v Speaker 5>minutes before I come out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my gloves are laced up,</v>

1847
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.360
<v Speaker 5>breaking my gloves down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm pushing the lever on the back of</v>

1848
01:17:57.361 --> 01:17:59.370
<v Speaker 5>my break in the middle of the glove for</v>
<v Speaker 5>my knuckle,</v>

1849
01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.290
<v Speaker 5>compares to the lack of feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my knuckle,</v>

1850
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 5>Pearson against the tight leather gloves</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the everlast boxing gloves.</v>

1851
01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I come around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have supreme confidence and I'm scared</v>

1852
01:18:07.741 --> 01:18:09.950
<v Speaker 5>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally afraid.</v>

1853
01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:11.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm afraid of Evec name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>afraid of losing.</v>

1854
01:18:11.881 --> 01:18:14.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm afraid of being humiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm totally confident.</v>

1855
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:15.800
<v Speaker 5>Close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get to ring.</v>

1856
01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:18.950
<v Speaker 5>The more confidence I get closer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more confidence.</v>

1857
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.490
<v Speaker 5>I get closer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more confidence.</v>

1858
01:18:20.491 --> 01:18:23.580
<v Speaker 5>I get all during my training.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been afraid of this man.</v>

1859
01:18:23.581 --> 01:18:25.530
<v Speaker 5>I thought this man may be capable of</v>
<v Speaker 5>beating me.</v>

1860
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:28.360
<v Speaker 5>I've dreamed up from beaten me but that</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1861
01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.290
<v Speaker 5>but I always stayed afraid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was close.</v>

1862
01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.720
<v Speaker 5>I get to her and I'm more confident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once I'm in the ring,</v>

1863
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm a God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one can beat me.</v>

1864
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1865
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:50.210
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that because that what you were</v>

1866
01:18:50.211 --> 01:18:54.320
<v Speaker 3>saying about all that work for that one</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

1867
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.020
<v Speaker 3>there's so much mind fucking going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1868
01:18:57.090 --> 01:18:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mental,</v>

1869
01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you know the thing like people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how mental fighting is and</v>

1870
01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:06.200
<v Speaker 2>they can't really appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hardest part is after you have</v>

1871
01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:10.670
<v Speaker 2>been broken to still get that back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very tough thing to do.</v>

1872
01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you've gone undefeated for so</v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

1873
01:19:12.801 --> 01:19:15.950
<v Speaker 2>you finally lose a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people come back from that or</v>

1874
01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.420
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people get back to the level</v>

1875
01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:19.320
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very fortunate I've lost,</v>

1876
01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:23.900
<v Speaker 2>but I got crushed my first fight and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was able to overcome that and to build</v>

1877
01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 2>myself up and it helped motivate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went onto win like 18 fights</v>

1878
01:19:27.921 --> 01:19:31.790
<v Speaker 2>in a row after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw a lot of people go undefeated</v>

1879
01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:34.580
<v Speaker 2>for 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 fights and they just had this amazing</v>

1880
01:19:34.581 --> 01:19:36.140
<v Speaker 2>confidence in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just crushing everybody.</v>

1881
01:19:36.141 --> 01:19:40.520
<v Speaker 2>But they were also not learning a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important lessons that they needed</v>

1882
01:19:40.521 --> 01:19:43.040
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so once they finally lost it almost</v>

1883
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:46.980
<v Speaker 2>destroyed them and it's very tough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get so far in a game in,</v>

1884
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:51.230
<v Speaker 2>in miss all these lessons you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn until you're forced to learn them,</v>

1885
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can find a way to learn them</v>

1886
01:19:55.461 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing teaches as good as losing.</v>

1887
01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:01.090
<v Speaker 3>There's also losing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you see it in mma,</v>

1888
01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.040
<v Speaker 3>like fighters from different</v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplines,</v>

1889
01:20:03.041 --> 01:20:06.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe grapplers or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that loose by Kao for the first time.</v>

1890
01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a different animal.</v>

1891
01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened with me when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying well my two losses,</v>

1892
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:15.510
<v Speaker 2>like I'd never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never been stopped while I've been</v>

1893
01:20:15.511 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 2>stopped but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really hurt or really knocked</v>

1894
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 2>out before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happened twice in a row and it</v>

1895
01:20:21.451 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really devastating for me</v>

1896
01:20:23.701 --> 01:20:28.700
<v Speaker 2>mentally to have that happen and to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get back to where I was prior to that</v>

1897
01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 2>and not just skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skill,</v>

1898
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:30.781
<v Speaker 2>skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skill,</v>

1899
01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:32.910
<v Speaker 2>but that there's so many other factors</v>
<v Speaker 2>that go into this.</v>

1900
01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:34.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

1901
01:20:34.111 --> 01:20:37.890
<v Speaker 2>the way that you think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like being confident but not over</v>

1902
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being confident,</v>

1903
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1904
01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:43.460
<v Speaker 2>in understanding the danger in that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that'll keep you sharp with</v>

1905
01:20:43.461 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without affecting you.</v>

1906
01:20:44.521 --> 01:20:47.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like finding that balance between</v>

1907
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 2>being too nervous and too calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've always been more way,</v>

1908
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:52.530
<v Speaker 2>way to calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for my own good.</v>

1909
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And I always kind of a calm dude most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time you're very mellow,</v>

1910
01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:56.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1911
01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:57.960
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning I thought everybody was</v>

1912
01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 2>like that and then I would see people</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for fights in there</v>

1913
01:21:00.751 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 2>freaking out and like they can't walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>into like I can't do this,</v>

1914
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this.</v>

1915
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 2>And these like high level people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been watching.</v>

1916
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:06.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeez man.</v>

1917
01:21:06.731 --> 01:21:07.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with you?</v>

1918
01:21:07.441 --> 01:21:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are you so nervous about your</v>

1919
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:11.640
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1920
01:21:11.641 --> 01:21:12.141
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1921
01:21:12.141 --> 01:21:15.630
<v Speaker 2>I one day I realized like being to calm</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't so great either because I went</v>

1922
01:21:15.631 --> 01:21:17.910
<v Speaker 2>into a fight once and like I had no</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline going.</v>

1923
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm like half asleep like alright man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know about the fight and this</v>

1924
01:21:21.301 --> 01:21:23.340
<v Speaker 2>guy is coming across the room from him.</v>

1925
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1926
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:26.100
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's going to try to kill you.</v>

1927
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 2>You'd better get going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took me a whole round to get back</v>

1928
01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:34.140
<v Speaker 2>into that mental zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen that cowboys for one video</v>

1929
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 2>of his breakdown walking a walk into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage?</v>

1930
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's similar.</v>

1931
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:43.810
<v Speaker 2>It's just like that where it's about his</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental approach process and everything.</v>

1932
01:21:44.221 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

1933
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:50.850
<v Speaker 2>He's changed a lot of stuff in his game</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a God that has survived some</v>

1934
01:21:50.851 --> 01:21:53.250
<v Speaker 2>pretty devastating losses and come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>even better.</v>

1935
01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.473
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1936
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.020
<v Speaker 2>That is really the key because no matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually if you do this long enough,</v>

1937
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 2>those things are gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how if and how you overcome them is</v>

1938
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:06.150
<v Speaker 2>really what shows you what it would a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great fighter is because anybody that</v>

1939
01:22:06.151 --> 01:22:09.030
<v Speaker 2>goes around winning and just crushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's as great and all.</v>

1940
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 2>But if you haven't ever come back from</v>
<v Speaker 2>total destruction,</v>

1941
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you're not a complete fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel.</v>

1942
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cowboy since the dos Anjos fight is the</v>

1943
01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:22.590
<v Speaker 2>best version of cowboy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before that it was the pettis fight,</v>

1944
01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:24.350
<v Speaker 2>the pettis fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got stopped and Pettis fight came</v>

1945
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.193
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And better than that,</v>

1946
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:28.380
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy that is like the adversity</v>
<v Speaker 2>builds him.</v>

1947
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:31.740
<v Speaker 2>It makes him stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever worked with a</v>

1948
01:22:31.741 --> 01:22:33.990
<v Speaker 2>psychological coach or a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1949
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1950
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.750
<v Speaker 2>back when I was in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1951
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:37.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1952
01:22:37.521 --> 01:22:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I originally started doing it because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke my hand three times in a year and</v>

1953
01:22:41.341 --> 01:22:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I was always so hesitant to throw it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1954
01:22:44.371 --> 01:22:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always painful and stuff.</v>

1955
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I know it was just like mentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get over it.</v>

1956
01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.450
<v Speaker 2>And I started a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1957
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.670
<v Speaker 2>that was how it originally started</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with a mental coach with like a</v>

1958
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.600
<v Speaker 2>sort of hypnosis but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more just the getting,</v>

1959
01:22:57.601 --> 01:22:59.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting to that right mind frame,</v>

1960
01:22:59.781 --> 01:23:03.260
<v Speaker 2>like going into the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started going from there as</v>

1961
01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>like very specific things wanted to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>on</v>

1962
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 1>because it's all about having that right</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality when you get in there or when</v>

1963
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you're getting into training as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just going through the motions and</v>

1964
01:23:14.201 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you can get very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when he'd been doing this for</v>

1965
01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 1>so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get very comfortable in too</v>

1966
01:23:18.431 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems I've had,</v>

1967
01:23:20.981 --> 01:23:25.680
<v Speaker 1>especially being so calm as I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for me to just be like</v>

1968
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1969
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.190
<v Speaker 1>like we're just seeking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

1970
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it's your mental coach would</v>

1971
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 1>help you with your mindset for training</v>
<v Speaker 1>to prepare,</v>

1972
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:36.010
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training as well as fighting,</v>

1973
01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:36.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1974
01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.570
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stuff did you work on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1975
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for training,</v>

1976
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 1>just having that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1977
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm like,</v>

1978
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to,</v>

1979
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 1>to very specifically build myself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get ready for this fight.</v>

1980
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to work out.</v>

1981
01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:55.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference between working out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and training and that's something like</v>

1982
01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>you're very focused on the task at hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

1983
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this to be the best in</v>

1984
01:24:02.051 --> 01:24:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1985
01:24:03.851 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 1>you're getting ready for this date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to give it all you have at this</v>

1986
01:24:06.611 --> 01:24:09.910
<v Speaker 1>very specific moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of just casually getting</v>

1987
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:10.810
<v Speaker 1>through the training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1988
01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you're doing everything you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

1989
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not mentally doing that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1990
01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 1>when you get into the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fight in that kind of</v>

1991
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:20.950
<v Speaker 1>laid back casual way as opposed to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>being this very,</v>

1992
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1993
01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.960
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're training your,</v>

1994
01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.850
<v Speaker 1>your specifically gearing up to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

1995
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dialing everything in,</v>

1996
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:31.870
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1997
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1998
01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.320
<v Speaker 1>some people have more of that automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and they're like,</v>

1999
01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:36.910
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very focused,</v>

2000
01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:37.744
<v Speaker 1>very determined.</v>

2001
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this for this specific goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2002
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:43.660
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after you've been doing this for so</v>

2003
01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:45.580
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just becomes like that.</v>

2004
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get through it and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you kind of almost get lazy,</v>

2005
01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 1>mentally not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been lazy physically.</v>

2006
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2007
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I've always pushed myself almost too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2008
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally,</v>

2009
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:58.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been times when I've had those,</v>

2010
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 1>those bad fights is one I've allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself to slip.</v>

2011
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Whether that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2012
01:25:03.581 --> 01:25:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person I was fighting didn't,</v>

2013
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 1>didn't give me enough a threat in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind or,</v>

2014
01:25:09.491 --> 01:25:11.830
<v Speaker 1>or are there was some things going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the gym,</v>

2015
01:25:11.831 --> 01:25:15.330
<v Speaker 1>will have family and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pets dying and things like that,</v>

2016
01:25:15.331 --> 01:25:16.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of baroque certain things to</v>

2017
01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.340
<v Speaker 1>me down where I was still doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

2018
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:22.090
<v Speaker 1>but mentally I was just broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relationships are a big one with</v>

2019
01:25:22.091 --> 01:25:22.810
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2020
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2021
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 1>when you see fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get broken up relationship or they</v>

2022
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:29.860
<v Speaker 1>have a crazy girlfriend or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of fighters,</v>

2023
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 1>like there's a body mind used to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fighters and it would seem like</v>

2024
01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:37.150
<v Speaker 1>every time his fighter was getting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get ready to compete,</v>

2025
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:41.790
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend would have some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>major drama and waking him up in the</v>

2026
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:44.350
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night screaming at him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just wanted to fight.</v>

2027
01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Like as he was gearing up to a fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was pulling away from her and</v>

2028
01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:50.920
<v Speaker 1>concentrating more on what this event</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be.</v>

2029
01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:54.130
<v Speaker 1>So she didn't like the fact that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending less time paying attention to</v>

2030
01:25:54.131 --> 01:25:56.430
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she started getting super needy and</v>

2031
01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 1>it would fuck them up every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough man and that's why you'll see</v>

2032
01:25:59.081 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fighters leave and go away to</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

2033
01:26:01.661 --> 01:26:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like boxers and stuff.</v>

2034
01:26:03.171 --> 01:26:04.004
<v Speaker 1>They'll totally</v>

2035
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:09.310
<v Speaker 2>leave town and set up shop somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>else because you have to be so focused</v>

2036
01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:12.680
<v Speaker 2>on this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your life is on the line,</v>

2037
01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.770
<v Speaker 2>even just in the gym or the life is on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>

2038
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>We don't really don't really think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or,</v>

2039
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2040
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:20.080
<v Speaker 2>put that much emphasis on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But every day we get in there we,</v>

2041
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:24.260
<v Speaker 2>we risk a injury and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously a severe case,</v>

2042
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.400
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it happens definitely in.</v>

2043
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're not taking the necessary</v>
<v Speaker 2>precautions and going into it with,</v>

2044
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 2>with that right mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can get hurt really bad.</v>

2045
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.230
<v Speaker 2>What were you going to survive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really lucky.</v>

2046
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2047
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been with Karen since I was 16,</v>

2048
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:41.390
<v Speaker 2>so he's not only been my coach but he's</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows as soon as we're going to hit</v>

2051
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.640
<v Speaker 2>pads,</v>

<v Speaker 2>by just my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body movement.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let's get,</v>

2057
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:56.210
<v Speaker 2>let's get out of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2058
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to work with what's the</v>

2059
01:26:57.951 --> 01:26:58.431
<v Speaker 2>deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2060
01:26:58.431 --> 01:27:02.930
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2061
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:07.280
<v Speaker 2>he can see it a mile away even just by</v>
<v Speaker 2>my texting or whatever.</v>

2062
01:27:07.281 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really lucky and that's why it's so</v>

2063
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.340
<v Speaker 2>important to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just a great coach or a</v>

2064
01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:15.470
<v Speaker 2>great team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's having people around you who know</v>

2065
01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.490
<v Speaker 2>you and they can see these elements that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone who you haven't been</v>

2066
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 2>around long enough wouldn't see before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not pick up on just that very</v>

2067
01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 2>subtle vibe you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2068
01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what the hell is going on with you?</v>

2069
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Even though you're doing everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>

2070
01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you're training really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you can see that that thing</v>

2071
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:33.030
<v Speaker 2>that's off in their head and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

2072
01:27:33.031 --> 01:27:35.720
<v Speaker 2>what's great though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have people who you're friends with</v>

2073
01:27:35.721 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 2>and had been around for a long time.</v>

2074
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that in him.</v>

2075
01:27:38.361 --> 01:27:40.310
<v Speaker 2>He can see that in me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2076
01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:41.144
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2077
01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.580
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to talk about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2078
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you could just ease back a</v>

2079
01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:46.850
<v Speaker 2>little bit and you need to fix that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2080
01:27:46.851 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many things that could</v>

2081
01:27:48.531 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>

2082
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:52.700
<v Speaker 2>whether it's you overthinking the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether there's something going on</v>

2083
01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:54.650
<v Speaker 2>with someone outside the gym or you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2084
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.430
<v Speaker 2>you've just got a bad vibe or it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's knowing when sometimes you got to</v>

2085
01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:00.730
<v Speaker 2>take a little step back and maybe not</v>
<v Speaker 2>push yourself so hard,</v>

2086
01:28:00.731 --> 01:28:01.311
<v Speaker 2>but be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2087
01:28:01.311 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 2>just ease back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2088
01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's all about finding that winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination,</v>

2089
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:07.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2090
01:28:07.661 --> 01:28:10.600
<v Speaker 1>and obviously your mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to think about.</v>

2091
01:28:10.601 --> 01:28:11.860
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to be different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>

2092
01:28:11.861 --> 01:28:12.694
<v Speaker 1>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different.</v>

2093
01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Probably going to be different than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2094
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.000
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank joe shillings mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got their own little weird</v>

2095
01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:22.990
<v Speaker 1>tweaky shit that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can't just tell him,</v>

2096
01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do this.</v>

2097
01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like people will ask me,</v>

2098
01:28:26.831 --> 01:28:28.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should I do mentally to prepare</v>

2099
01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:29.380
<v Speaker 1>myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2100
01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know for myself what that</v>

2101
01:28:32.621 --> 01:28:36.850
<v Speaker 1>is because it's a constant learning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusting things can change every camp.</v>

2102
01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:38.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like that.</v>

2103
01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:39.970
<v Speaker 1>People like to be able to show up at</v>
<v Speaker 1>work at 9:00.</v>

2104
01:28:39.971 --> 01:28:41.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a coffee break at 10:30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2105
01:28:42.010 --> 01:28:44.530
<v Speaker 1>at noon they'd go to lunch at 5:00 PM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go home,</v>

2106
01:28:44.531 --> 01:28:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that easy.</v>

2107
01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't you hate it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hate it.</v>

2108
01:28:49.811 --> 01:28:50.611
<v Speaker 1>I would hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have.</v>

2109
01:28:50.611 --> 01:28:51.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2110
01:28:51.191 --> 01:28:52.540
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can do this.</v>

2111
01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've experienced life at 10,</v>

2112
01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.660
<v Speaker 1>like you guys are living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're living this extremely</v>

2113
01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.980
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

2114
01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 1>incredibly complex</v>

2115
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.650
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2116
01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:08.580
<v Speaker 3>the task of being a professional combat</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports athlete is one of the most</v>

2117
01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>difficult jobs that is available to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person really is.</v>

2118
01:29:12.301 --> 01:29:14.430
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly difficult.</v>

2119
01:29:14.431 --> 01:29:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just difficult.</v>

2120
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:19.350
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a single fucking thing</v>

2121
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:24.351
<v Speaker 3>that's easy about it and to find the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right formula to make that thing work</v>

2122
01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:26.990
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2123
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:29.220
<v Speaker 3>It's so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2124
01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:30.330
<v Speaker 3>There's so much involved.</v>

2125
01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you really have to pay attention to</v>

2126
01:29:33.681 --> 01:29:38.540
<v Speaker 2>it because the longer you let things</v>
<v Speaker 2>slide and don't realize like,</v>

2127
01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:40.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're letting this slip over here,</v>

2128
01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:42.620
<v Speaker 2>the harder it is to make those</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustments.</v>

2129
01:29:42.621 --> 01:29:46.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was saying like every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you're on both sides of of too much</v>

2130
01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:49.040
<v Speaker 2>or too little of of one thing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

2131
01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's your mental approach,</v>

2132
01:29:51.171 --> 01:29:53.810
<v Speaker 2>whether it's your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's how much or how little</v>

2133
01:29:53.811 --> 01:29:56.420
<v Speaker 2>you're running there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many variables that go into</v>

2134
01:29:56.421 --> 01:29:57.070
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2135
01:29:57.070 --> 01:30:00.050
<v Speaker 3>What about strength and conditioning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys do follow a strength</v>

2136
01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.240
<v Speaker 3>conditioning routines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons</v>

2137
01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.660
<v Speaker 2>tons up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of stuff do you do?</v>

2138
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't even begin to describe this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2139
01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of sprints.</v>

2140
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.170
<v Speaker 2>It just really depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It switches every day and again,</v>

2141
01:30:14.171 --> 01:30:18.940
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing where you have to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>what works best for you on that day,</v>

2142
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.530
<v Speaker 2>in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

2143
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:23.210
<v Speaker 2>in that certain fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like how,</v>

2144
01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>how much is too much or how little is</v>
<v Speaker 2>too little and your dial in.</v>

2145
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't constantly and some because</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you go to a bail,</v>

2146
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:30.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm going to do tomorrow,</v>

2147
01:30:30.821 --> 01:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>but then you wake up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not going to work for me today,</v>

2148
01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four or sometimes just doing it for the</v>

2149
01:30:37.241 --> 01:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>sake of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2150
01:30:38.201 --> 01:30:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it because I don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm doing what I need to push</v>

2151
01:30:40.661 --> 01:30:42.940
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that's not the wisest thing.</v>

2152
01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Just pushing yourself for the sake of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing yourself isn't always the right</v>

2153
01:30:46.571 --> 01:30:48.100
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2154
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.860
<v Speaker 2>And and trying to find that is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

2155
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like I was saying before about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what injury is too bad to where you</v>

2156
01:30:55.091 --> 01:30:56.890
<v Speaker 2>should take this fight off and once an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

2157
01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.330
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

2158
01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.530
<v Speaker 2>What's that Ninja?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2159
01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.840
<v Speaker 2>I stubbed my toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going into my world title fight.</v>

2160
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I busted my rib like a nine days prior</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2161
01:31:07.991 --> 01:31:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even move for two days.</v>

2162
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.661
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2163
01:31:10.661 --> 01:31:13.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should not fight in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2164
01:31:13.211 --> 01:31:16.240
<v Speaker 2>that went through my head of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I couldn't do anything.</v>

2165
01:31:16.241 --> 01:31:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

2166
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm always somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said I'm going to do it no matter</v>

2167
01:31:22.001 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 2>how that was broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it a intercostal tear?</v>

2168
01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.080
<v Speaker 2>The tear of the tissue in between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ribs?</v>

2169
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very painful.</v>

2170
01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:31.630
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it happened,</v>

2171
01:31:31.631 --> 01:31:35.200
<v Speaker 2>my rib was sticking out like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop it back into place and like duct</v>

2172
01:31:35.201 --> 01:31:39.980
<v Speaker 2>tape it down and I literally couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a breath and I was like,</v>

2173
01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.670
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even train.</v>

2174
01:31:42.671 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I still got like over a week to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2175
01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I gotta make weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do all these things and it's</v>

2176
01:31:47.651 --> 01:31:49.290
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm laying in bed for two days just</v>

2177
01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.220
<v Speaker 2>taking these short breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't lay down,</v>

2178
01:31:51.221 --> 01:31:56.170
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sit up and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been working so long to get to this</v>

2179
01:31:56.171 --> 01:31:58.990
<v Speaker 2>point and this happens to me right</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

2180
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was brutal.</v>

2181
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.100
<v Speaker 4>So what'd you end up doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have fought and crushed him.</v>

2182
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

2183
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you get a cortisone shot or anything</v>

2184
01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 4>in it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2185
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:10.271
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2186
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:12.740
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of body work done.</v>

2187
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked with my,</v>

2188
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:18.970
<v Speaker 4>a mind coach a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I was just like,</v>

2189
01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 4>literally if somebody touches me there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2190
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm,</v>

2191
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:25.660
<v Speaker 4>my body's going to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even if I'm mentally strong,</v>

2192
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.550
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was so worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2193
01:32:27.551 --> 01:32:29.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna go out there and guys just</v>
<v Speaker 4>touched me.</v>

2194
01:32:29.021 --> 01:32:30.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna fall in like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2195
01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:31.630
<v Speaker 4>knock me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2196
01:32:31.631 --> 01:32:35.080
<v Speaker 4>I was really worried about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

2197
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:35.914
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2198
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.890
<v Speaker 4>He still has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might go the whole fight not even</v>

2199
01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:40.000
<v Speaker 4>touched me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2200
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:45.001
<v Speaker 4>I can't be so concerned about this one</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that I'm not going to allow this</v>

2201
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:46.600
<v Speaker 4>to break me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2202
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:50.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at what point do you do allow things to</v>

2203
01:32:50.051 --> 01:32:50.831
<v Speaker 4>break you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2204
01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing that's going to break</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2205
01:32:51.971 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing going to stop me if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can physically get in there,</v>

2206
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:55.294
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it.</v>

2207
01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.960
<v Speaker 3>There's a fine line that people make</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're training and they're</v>

2208
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:04.420
<v Speaker 3>putting together a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a big debate,</v>

2209
01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 3>especially in mma over how much strength</v>
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning you should do versus</v>

2210
01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 3>how much fight specific skill training</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do.</v>

2211
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Where do you guys fit in on that and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you make the distinction?</v>

2212
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there should be a balance</v>
<v Speaker 4>between both.</v>

2213
01:33:19.311 --> 01:33:19.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotTa,</v>

2214
01:33:19.971 --> 01:33:22.840
<v Speaker 4>you gotTa know what you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think you have to do strength</v>

2215
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:23.840
<v Speaker 4>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

2216
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.681
<v Speaker 4>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

2217
01:33:24.681 --> 01:33:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you should run.</v>

2218
01:33:25.941 --> 01:33:29.050
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other MMA fighters that don't run around</v>

2219
01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.290
<v Speaker 4>running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sprinting,</v>

2220
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:31.370
<v Speaker 4>strengthening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditioning.</v>

2221
01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.440
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's different for every person.</v>

2222
01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.600
<v Speaker 4>Now when you say running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you run distances?</v>

2223
01:33:35.601 --> 01:33:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Do you run hills miles at a time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do a lot.</v>

2224
01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.870
<v Speaker 4>We have the shortest run that I do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>four miles a night.</v>

2225
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Most of the Times I do that twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're running eight miles in a day.</v>

2226
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just really depends.</v>

2227
01:33:47.181 --> 01:33:48.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how I'm feeling that day that,</v>

2228
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:50.680
<v Speaker 4>so I go either for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2229
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:52.390
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

2230
01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:54.070
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday I have to get my running.</v>

2231
01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:55.910
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise I feel like I'm not training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

2232
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:56.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2233
01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.490
<v Speaker 3>So you do the run in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you train at night,</v>

2234
01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.300
<v Speaker 3>is that.</v>

2235
01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.450
<v Speaker 4>So I run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I usually,</v>

2236
01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.050
<v Speaker 4>so Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monday is kinda like a,</v>

2237
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:06.080
<v Speaker 4>it's not as long as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long of a day for me.</v>

2238
01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Like I have like a long training session</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the afternoon,</v>

2239
01:34:08.481 --> 01:34:11.190
<v Speaker 4>but then Tuesday I run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we do strength and conditioning.</v>

2240
01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Then they come back in the afternoon</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they hit pat's a,</v>

2241
01:34:14.061 --> 01:34:16.090
<v Speaker 4>then we all parked together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2242
01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:18.230
<v Speaker 4>so that's Kinda like a longer day for</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2243
01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:22.130
<v Speaker 4>So you have a couple days where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a big brutal,</v>

2244
01:34:22.131 --> 01:34:24.080
<v Speaker 4>crazy day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's like four workouts you're</v>

2245
01:34:24.081 --> 01:34:26.270
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're running,</v>

2246
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:27.510
<v Speaker 4>running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditioning,</v>

2247
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:29.780
<v Speaker 4>running again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pat work,</v>

2248
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:31.220
<v Speaker 4>sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sparring,</v>

2249
01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then pull up neck exercises to crossfit</v>

2250
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I really try.</v>

2251
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:40.250
<v Speaker 4>I try to put everything that I can into</v>
<v Speaker 4>my training.</v>

2252
01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.100
<v Speaker 4>So fight day comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2253
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:46.100
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing else I could have done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>

2254
01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 4>But you also have to find that balance</v>
<v Speaker 4>between those things too.</v>

2255
01:34:51.201 --> 01:34:55.790
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like I can't 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>crush every single thing I'm doing.</v>

2256
01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:57.860
<v Speaker 4>I can't sprint for miles,</v>

2257
01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>crush the pads as hard as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as hard as I can kill the bag as hard as</v>

2258
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2259
01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.690
<v Speaker 1>It's what is it that you're working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that moment,</v>

2260
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And am I just working on my technique</v>

2261
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:12.950
<v Speaker 1>and my things in my footwork and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and as well as that.</v>

2262
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like every time we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning it's just full</v>

2263
01:35:16.341 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 1>on kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprint,</v>

2264
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it might be.</v>

2265
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:20.960
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but later on maybe we're doing a little</v>

2266
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 1>more technical stuff so we'd definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>switch it up at the gym.</v>

2267
01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you man,</v>

2268
01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that balance,</v>

2269
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 1>which is what's interesting about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you know the right way to go</v>

2270
01:35:33.111 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't fade or towards the end of</v>

2271
01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's obviously back now,</v>

2272
01:35:36.801 --> 01:35:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but towards the end of his mma career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he abandoned all strength and</v>

2273
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:41.420
<v Speaker 1>conditioning and he's just doing fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

2274
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.900
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what works for the individual,</v>

2275
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:45.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2276
01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what would I do?</v>

2277
01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I was not going to tell everyone you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do this because then you're</v>

2278
01:35:51.281 --> 01:35:53.990
<v Speaker 1>going to be like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't have the same schedule.</v>

2279
01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:56.540
<v Speaker 1>We were very different in the thing we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2280
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:58.940
<v Speaker 1>We do a lot of stuff together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of stuff we don't do</v>

2281
01:35:58.941 --> 01:36:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the same at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the differences between you two</v>

2282
01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 1>terms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Training?</v>

2283
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't run as much as he does anymore.</v>

2284
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:08.150
<v Speaker 1>But like the older I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less I'm running.</v>

2286
01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Like I paid it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2287
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done,</v>

2288
01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I've done the running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is there a benefit to you?</v>

2289
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Do I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything wrong with you not</v>

2290
01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:17.990
<v Speaker 1>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel so.</v>

2291
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:20.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to find a way to make up</v>

2292
01:36:20.091 --> 01:36:20.860
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2293
01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:23.060
<v Speaker 1>like I know people who hardly run at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

2294
01:36:23.061 --> 01:36:26.330
<v Speaker 1>but they also find a way to stumble a</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement that,</v>

2295
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2296
01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They might do a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bag backgrounds are a lot more rounds,</v>

2297
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to that where you know</v>

2298
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:35.990
<v Speaker 1>there's not just one thing you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

2299
01:36:35.991 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 1>this many rounds is this many miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do,</v>

2300
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to eat exactly like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it exactly like this.</v>

2301
01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.110
<v Speaker 1>It changes and it changes for me daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekly,</v>

2302
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every fight is different.</v>

2303
01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might do more,</v>

2304
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:49.430
<v Speaker 1>do less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2305
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I've had fights where I couldn't run</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I snapped all the tendons in my</v>

2306
01:36:52.761 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 1>ankle and I had to swim instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2307
01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:57.000
<v Speaker 1>and I still feel great now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

2308
01:36:57.001 --> 01:37:00.650
<v Speaker 1>And I have felt like I had just as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio and I had to.</v>

2309
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I had to make up for it somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other aspects of what I was doing.</v>

2310
01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:05.240
<v Speaker 1>You're making up for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

2311
01:37:05.241 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 1>the one who's got this schedule in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2312
01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:12.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's that mind fuck of am I</v>
<v Speaker 1>slacking off or am I pushing myself hard</v>

2313
01:37:12.321 --> 01:37:14.390
<v Speaker 1>enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you know that Kinda that</v>

2314
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.220
<v Speaker 1>kinda comes from the way I came up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2315
01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I came up with high trainers who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak English,</v>

2316
01:37:20.061 --> 01:37:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn everything very much.</v>

2317
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So by doing it myself and figuring it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out myself,</v>

2318
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had had people telling me what</v>

2319
01:37:28.401 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 1>to do or what I should eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I shouldn't eat,</v>

2320
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.190
<v Speaker 1>everything I've done and learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of what I've done and learned has</v>

2321
01:37:34.191 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 1>been by application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it hilarious and fun to watch</v>

2322
01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:42.710
<v Speaker 1>when you see Thai guys training with</v>
<v Speaker 1>American people and American people</v>

2323
01:37:42.711 --> 01:37:46.850
<v Speaker 1>don't speak Thai and the Thai guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't speak English and they're trying</v>

2324
01:37:46.851 --> 01:37:50.870
<v Speaker 1>to teach them a technique and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just kinda like doing it with</v>

2325
01:37:50.871 --> 01:37:53.600
<v Speaker 1>your hip and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this weird thing where you're</v>

2326
01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>looking at each other and they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure what the other guy's saying.</v>

2327
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because I didn't,</v>

2328
01:37:57.390 --> 01:38:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really start thinking of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex what I was doing was until I</v>

2329
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>started teaching people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'd been doing this for almost</v>

2330
01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:09.450
<v Speaker 1>10 years before I actually started</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to train people and I remember</v>

2331
01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the first time I taught somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was a seminar,</v>

2332
01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:12.511
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2333
01:38:12.511 --> 01:38:13.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kick,</v>

2334
01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just do it,</v>

2335
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:15.990
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

2336
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:16.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you gotta do this,</v>

2337
01:38:16.921 --> 01:38:17.671
<v Speaker 1>you gotta do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2338
01:38:17.671 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like 15 steps involved in just</v>

2339
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 1>the kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's funny you said that because</v>

2340
01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 1>we worked out today and you're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

2341
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were talking just about the</v>

2342
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:32.160
<v Speaker 1>switch kick and I think you went on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minute rant of just all the different</v>

2343
01:38:32.161 --> 01:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>variables that are involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very illuminating.</v>

2344
01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:38.160
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it again.</v>

2345
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2346
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I learned it by doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't till teaching it that I</v>

2347
01:38:42.631 --> 01:38:47.631
<v Speaker 1>had to figure out what all those steps</v>
<v Speaker 1>were and which has helped me in what I</v>

2348
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:52.761
<v Speaker 1>do and help me improve a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques I have and realizing all the,</v>

2349
01:38:53.230 --> 01:38:56.610
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of every technique of</v>
<v Speaker 1>every movement in it.</v>

2350
01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And when I explain it to people and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I train people,</v>

2351
01:38:59.371 --> 01:39:02.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is just me telling them how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it,</v>

2352
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:03.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were were,</v>

2353
01:39:03.970 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 1>were how I learned was just just do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go run,</v>

2354
01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.730
<v Speaker 1>go kick the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like hey,</v>

2355
01:39:08.731 --> 01:39:12.090
<v Speaker 1>you gotta fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like by watching and studying.</v>

2356
01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it really how I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting.</v>

2357
01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And maybe unfortunately there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could train with a lot of people and</v>

2358
01:39:19.381 --> 01:39:22.200
<v Speaker 1>they would never point out some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you guys pointed out today.</v>

2359
01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It's finding someone who's technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>proficient and understands how to,</v>

2360
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.680
<v Speaker 1>how to relay that information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the harder parts of being a</v>

2361
01:39:31.681 --> 01:39:35.000
<v Speaker 1>martial artist unless you're a self</v>
<v Speaker 1>starter and you just do a lot of.</v>

2362
01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Well now today obviously when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day you can do youtube,</v>

2363
01:39:37.891 --> 01:39:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but now you can just get online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can watch a million.</v>

2364
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you might find some shitty ones too.</v>

2365
01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I've found some shitty ones on all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things where they don't know what the</v>

2366
01:39:45.451 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 1>fuck they're talking about on all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different martial arts techniques.</v>

2367
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that Kinda like the</v>

2368
01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:55.590
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times high level people didn't</v>

2369
01:39:55.591 --> 01:39:57.870
<v Speaker 1>really have to learn things because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>came so naturally.</v>

2370
01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:02.070
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to learn all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental aspects that go into this</v>

2371
01:40:02.071 --> 01:40:04.470
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas somebody that might not be as</v>

2372
01:40:04.471 --> 01:40:07.140
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've studied it a lot more and that's</v>

2373
01:40:07.141 --> 01:40:12.000
<v Speaker 1>why a lot of times you'll see not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level of fighters be the better</v>

2374
01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:15.690
<v Speaker 1>coaches because they had to study it so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more and they've had to really look</v>

2375
01:40:15.691 --> 01:40:20.460
<v Speaker 1>into it and dissect it that much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they weren't able to or or for</v>

2376
01:40:20.461 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason do it so naturally.</v>

2377
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Like Freddie Roach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

2379
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was amazing fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a good fighter,</v>

2380
01:40:27.571 --> 01:40:29.460
<v Speaker 1>really good fire fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2381
01:40:29.461 --> 01:40:30.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>

2382
01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.550
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2383
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:33.390
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you know,</v>

2384
01:40:33.391 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not the best coach in the</v>

2385
01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:36.610
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2386
01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but a guy like Freddy Roach has really</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to develop that and figure those</v>

2387
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:43.290
<v Speaker 1>things out and he can tell somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

2388
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how you do it because I've had</v>

2389
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:46.630
<v Speaker 1>to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2390
01:40:46.631 --> 01:40:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's something like I've gone a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone out of my way to do,</v>

2391
01:40:50.041 --> 01:40:52.350
<v Speaker 1>like it was much more natural for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2392
01:40:52.351 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but throughout the years I've,</v>

2393
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I've realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2394
01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 1>and how do I tell someone how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

2395
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I've had to figure out what those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and how do I,</v>

2396
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 1>how do I tell someone how to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>work because I can just do it just by</v>

2397
01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:04.250
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2398
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I can watch somebody do something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2399
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2400
01:41:07.251 --> 01:41:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but how do I explain this to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had to dissect my,</v>

2401
01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:15.110
<v Speaker 1>my own self and realize all these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these aspects of the technique</v>

2402
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:20.341
<v Speaker 1>and it allows me to translate that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else as well as fine tune it in</v>

2403
01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:21.970
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2404
01:41:21.971 --> 01:41:26.971
<v Speaker 1>when you guys watch mma and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Stephen Thompson that has a</v>

2405
01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:33.180
<v Speaker 1>few elements of Moitai he uses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he uses a lot of sport karate,</v>

2406
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 1>which is a completely different stance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and completely different style.</v>

2407
01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.730
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on that when you wash</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will,</v>

2408
01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 1>what his style or when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2409
01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:49.801
<v Speaker 1>they definitely don't really mean well</v>
<v Speaker 1>with leg kicks in some techniques,</v>

2410
01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:52.120
<v Speaker 1>but essentially he's doing a sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>karate style.</v>

2411
01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of the same thing with</v>

2412
01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like just because someone's</v>

2413
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.790
<v Speaker 1>throwing an elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because somebody has a clenched</v>

2414
01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:59.830
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily make it more tie.</v>

2415
01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:01.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of arts that have those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2416
01:42:01.901 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to view him as a</v>

2417
01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Moitai Meta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of Anderson is a more Thai</v>

2418
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:07.324
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

2419
01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.450
<v Speaker 1>He thought of himself as a Moy Thai</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

2420
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 1>That's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2421
01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:13.930
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't view them as a fighter at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2422
01:42:13.931 --> 01:42:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I know is an MMA fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything he did was very moist.</v>

2423
01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Even his clench was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's such a fundamental basic</v>

2424
01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>clench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2425
01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's just because everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so terrible at it.</v>

2426
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:26.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like grab the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't see that in high level</v>

2427
01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Muay Thai guys going up and grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other by the neck.</v>

2428
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It's in transition and one of the hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>people when they get tired very,</v>

2429
01:42:32.261 --> 01:42:34.110
<v Speaker 1>it's very much a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2430
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.990
<v Speaker 1>us of struggling for dominance over</v>
<v Speaker 1>under those kinds of things,</v>

2431
01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 1>but a big sloppy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous arm bar.</v>

2432
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:41.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2433
01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:44.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like day one more time.</v>

2434
01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.380
<v Speaker 1>So when you saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the rich Franklin fight with the</v>

2435
01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:50.490
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how did he not learn this this</v>

2436
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:55.500
<v Speaker 1>first day in training and what was even</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse was I had a friend that I trained</v>

2437
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 1>with that went out to help him for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second one and he just didn't want to</v>

2438
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:01.390
<v Speaker 1>hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they did not want to hear that.</v>

2439
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:02.141
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2440
01:43:02.141 --> 01:43:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're doing at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as we talked about earlier,</v>

2441
01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:09.200
<v Speaker 1>these guys get to a high level and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their,</v>

2442
01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:11.440
<v Speaker 1>your technique is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2443
01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:12.850
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are like a kindergarten,</v>

2444
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:15.430
<v Speaker 1>like you don't know what you're doing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all whatsoever.</v>

2445
01:43:15.431 --> 01:43:17.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2446
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2447
01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:23.480
<v Speaker 1>So who was it that went out with him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2448
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2449
01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 1>hold a training partner of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was specifically brought there</v>

2450
01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:30.250
<v Speaker 1>because of his more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2451
01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:31.240
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2452
01:43:31.241 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you bring me in if you're not</v>

2453
01:43:34.121 --> 01:43:34.800
<v Speaker 1>going to use me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2454
01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been brought in for people to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2455
01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:40.360
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you use what you've brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>me in here to do?</v>

2456
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.520
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you brought me in for my,</v>

2457
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.430
<v Speaker 1>for my knowledge and the singing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to keep doing what you're</v>

2458
01:43:45.431 --> 01:43:46.300
<v Speaker 1>good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2459
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:47.500
<v Speaker 1>why am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>

2460
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:50.770
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a nice guy and such a smart</v>

2461
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a math teacher without a doubt.</v>

2462
01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:56.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you not see the math of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when people aren't.</v>

2463
01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:01.220
<v Speaker 1>People have a false sense of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're at in the sport and what they</v>

2464
01:44:01.221 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 1>can do and like you literally know</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

2465
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:08.540
<v Speaker 1>but you have this mentality that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're decent at standup,</v>

2466
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:09.160
<v Speaker 1>you're decent at.</v>

2467
01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>When we tie in your terrible compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that really does know what</v>

2468
01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:14.510
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2469
01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Most people's understanding is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary.</v>

2470
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:20.540
<v Speaker 1>If that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2471
01:44:20.541 --> 01:44:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you take another person in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on,</v>

2472
01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I can beat you without even touching</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2473
01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just let you mess yourself up</v>

2474
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:28.910
<v Speaker 1>because you don't really know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

2475
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy to think that someone could</v>

2476
01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 1>reach the world championship level in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that involves more Thai,</v>

2477
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many variables that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

2478
01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.330
<v Speaker 1>There's wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Jujitsu,</v>

2479
01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.960
<v Speaker 1>there's always things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's you can get away with a lot</v>

2480
01:44:41.961 --> 01:44:44.840
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the striking in mma you can get</v>

2481
01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:47.660
<v Speaker 1>away with because of those variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the smaller gloves,</v>

2482
01:44:47.661 --> 01:44:49.320
<v Speaker 1>because of the takedowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2483
01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you put that person in the ring with</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a moderately good.</v>

2484
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:56.660
<v Speaker 1>When we tie person a moderately good</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxer,</v>

2485
01:44:56.661 --> 01:44:59.090
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to get murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2486
01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like it can bring like a really</v>

2487
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:03.470
<v Speaker 1>good fit for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have any wrestling</v>

2488
01:45:03.471 --> 01:45:05.840
<v Speaker 1>defense defense or no Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

2489
01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Be able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2490
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look like an idiot.</v>

2491
01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:09.861
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2492
01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:12.370
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the appeals of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy who wins is most likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best fighter because if it was just</v>

2494
01:45:17.721 --> 01:45:21.050
<v Speaker 1>more tie or if it was just wrestling or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was just Jujitsu,</v>

2495
01:45:21.051 --> 01:45:23.060
<v Speaker 1>you would see someone who's the best at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2496
01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but when you throw everything in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's the kitchen sink get in there</v>

2497
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:31.460
<v Speaker 1>and that's when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see like who's been.</v>

2498
01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more complex puzzle.</v>

2499
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:38.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've never really understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument of like pitting this person</v>

2500
01:45:38.151 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 1>against that person or who's got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best Moitai never made well nobody</v>

2501
01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.390
<v Speaker 1>because they're not doing more tie.</v>

2502
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:44.781
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2503
01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:46.310
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that argument,</v>

2504
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 1>that conversation is completely invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2505
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put this boxer and against this</v>

2506
01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Moy Thai fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to win,</v>

2507
01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what rules are they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting under their fighting under more</v>

2508
01:45:54.631 --> 01:45:57.110
<v Speaker 1>type roles are going to get crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2509
01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that a wonderboy</v>

2510
01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Thompson is going to fight tyron</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodley,</v>

2511
01:46:01.131 --> 01:46:04.970
<v Speaker 1>who's the UFC welterweight champion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just a super powerful wrestler,</v>

2512
01:46:04.971 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but he's also training with Duke Roufus</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's obviously very talented,</v>

2513
01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.240
<v Speaker 1>knows a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great coach,</v>

2514
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:15.680
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I keep bringing up</v>

2515
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 1>wonderboy styles because it's so unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2516
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 1>we brought up Raymond Daniels in glory</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the only guys that has that</v>

2517
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:26.120
<v Speaker 1>similar background and then Michael Page</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course in mma fights were belt or has</v>

2518
01:46:26.121 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 1>a very similar style to that sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>karate style.</v>

2519
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:31.520
<v Speaker 1>What are the holes in that style?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's.</v>

2520
01:46:31.521 --> 01:46:34.740
<v Speaker 1>What's the pros and cons that you see as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fighter?</v>

2521
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 1>What we were speaking of earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2522
01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:40.670
<v Speaker 1>it's if you've never applied that in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2523
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.050
<v Speaker 1>a real fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2524
01:46:42.051 --> 01:46:43.610
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not point sparring,</v>

2525
01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:44.111
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2526
01:46:44.111 --> 01:46:44.830
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that,</v>

2527
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:47.870
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain techniques and things</v>

2528
01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:52.871
<v Speaker 1>that are completely worthless and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately in a lot of those sports</v>

2529
01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get exposed by that until it's</v>

2530
01:46:56.581 --> 01:46:58.650
<v Speaker 1>way too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying these techniques that</v>

2531
01:46:59.190 --> 01:46:59.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2532
01:46:59.651 --> 01:47:03.570
<v Speaker 1>a decent person just going to walk right</v>
<v Speaker 1>through because they look good and</v>

2533
01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 1>they're flashy and they're great on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pads and and all that,</v>

2534
01:47:06.481 --> 01:47:08.850
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have to damage someone,</v>

2535
01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:11.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Thomson knows how to do that</v>

2536
01:47:11.401 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's using those techniques</v>

2537
01:47:14.671 --> 01:47:19.671
<v Speaker 1>and applying them in a more fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a centric way and it's completely</v>

2538
01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:22.620
<v Speaker 1>different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see what I was trying to</v>

2539
01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:24.770
<v Speaker 1>get at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that such a weird style where you</v>

2540
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:28.620
<v Speaker 1>stand sideways and he leaps in and out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he moves back and forth from the</v>

2541
01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:29.670
<v Speaker 1>waist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a snake.</v>

2542
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness to the way he</v>

2543
01:47:33.601 --> 01:47:38.601
<v Speaker 1>moves and it's very difficult to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody that has that level skill with a</v>

2544
01:47:39.331 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 1>sport karate kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also has a really good wrestling</v>

2545
01:47:43.441 --> 01:47:44.274
<v Speaker 1>base to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's one of the biggest</v>

2547
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:50.190
<v Speaker 1>things in and why he's able to apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things because because he can deal</v>

2548
01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:52.410
<v Speaker 1>with the wrestling and everything else</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes in so,</v>

2549
01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:56.100
<v Speaker 1>so that's why you'll see him throw those</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques because he's not as worried</v>

2550
01:47:56.101 --> 01:47:58.800
<v Speaker 1>about it as someone who might be just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>good as him with those things.</v>

2551
01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:02.840
<v Speaker 1>It has zero ground wrestling or they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not gonna throw it because they're going</v>

2552
01:48:02.841 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 1>to get taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crushed.</v>

2553
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we were talking about your</v>

2554
01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 1>experience in a taekwondo school that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went there the first day you started</v>

2555
01:48:10.231 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 1>doing sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you through a low kick and then like get</v>

2556
01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:13.044
<v Speaker 1>outta here.</v>

2557
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Time to go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something to do effective.</v>

2558
01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being able to apply things in a real</v>

2559
01:48:19.021 --> 01:48:21.870
<v Speaker 1>fight and being able to apply them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

2560
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2561
01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we've seen Thompson can apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a real fight.</v>

2562
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:29.400
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing that you see that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

2563
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously it's not a Moy Thai</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

2564
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:35.520
<v Speaker 1>he's a kickboxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when you see that stance,</v>

2565
01:48:35.521 --> 01:48:37.500
<v Speaker 1>that weird stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sideways stance,</v>

2566
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:40.230
<v Speaker 1>when you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2567
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think much about it because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't watch a lot of MMA,</v>

2568
01:48:42.450 --> 01:48:43.910
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do,</v>

2569
01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I follow it,</v>

2570
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it when it's on and,</v>

2571
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2572
01:48:49.771 --> 01:48:52.920
<v Speaker 1>like paying attention to the fighters or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracking them throughout the years,</v>

2573
01:48:53.210 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 1>you know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so curious because you're so</v>

2574
01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your style so tiny.</v>

2575
01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously an expert at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always curious as to like how a</v>

2576
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:06.831
<v Speaker 1>person like you observes an expert</v>
<v Speaker 1>striker in sort of another realm.</v>

2577
01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:09.830
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an expert and he's becoming</v>

2578
01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:12.010
<v Speaker 1>an expert striker in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's,</v>

2579
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:16.170
<v Speaker 1>he's applying all the techniques that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that he knows and ha have worked</v>

2580
01:49:16.171 --> 01:49:19.410
<v Speaker 1>for him in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's different than if he would get</v>

2581
01:49:19.411 --> 01:49:23.370
<v Speaker 1>in the ring and do Moitai yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fighters like him have done</v>

2582
01:49:23.371 --> 01:49:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Moitai?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Raymond Daniels has done</v>

2583
01:49:25.291 --> 01:49:27.350
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing and some you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

2584
01:49:27.690 --> 01:49:31.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's another one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where being able to apply the things</v>

2585
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:37.400
<v Speaker 1>from your other sport into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like we were talking about with a</v>

2586
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Daniels and Nikki hold skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he just walked him down and he's</v>

2587
01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:41.520
<v Speaker 1>like Bop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bop,</v>

2588
01:49:41.521 --> 01:49:46.521
<v Speaker 1>crushing the Valtellina to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at a certain level it kind you,</v>

2589
01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you lose</v>

2590
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where you're spinning,</v>

2591
01:49:49.901 --> 01:49:51.970
<v Speaker 2>flashy techniques are going to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>

2592
01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

2593
01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:56.050
<v Speaker 2>those mid level guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you put them in there with the best</v>

2594
01:49:56.051 --> 01:49:59.000
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of that stuff gets exposed in,</v>

2595
01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:02.920
<v Speaker 2>is not working out so well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think that essentially</v>

2596
01:50:02.921 --> 01:50:06.340
<v Speaker 2>demonstrates the effectiveness of Moitai</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the highest levels you think is the</v>

2597
01:50:06.341 --> 01:50:07.640
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demonstrates the,</v>

2598
01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.570
<v Speaker 2>the holes and some of the stances in</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>

2599
01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not flinching on the things you</v>

2600
01:50:12.851 --> 01:50:16.660
<v Speaker 2>do and don't really care so much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hopping around and spin around,</v>

2601
01:50:16.661 --> 01:50:21.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm just walking down and crushing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's where that kind of</v>

2602
01:50:21.971 --> 01:50:24.310
<v Speaker 2>gets exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2603
01:50:24.311 --> 01:50:27.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like putting a boxer into a fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do is kick your legs and</v>

2604
01:50:27.971 --> 01:50:29.560
<v Speaker 2>you can't punch me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2605
01:50:29.561 --> 01:50:33.730
<v Speaker 2>But you take a box there and teach them</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to defend those kicks and standing a</v>

2606
01:50:33.731 --> 01:50:36.300
<v Speaker 2>little bit more of a squared up way.</v>

2607
01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 2>And where I can't use you use your</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness against you as much.</v>

2608
01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.190
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have much better success</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you never throw a kick.</v>

2609
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Now you just can take those kicks better</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just kill me with your,</v>

2610
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:48.140
<v Speaker 2>your high level hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you,</v>

2611
01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you said that you had taken some boxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches I had for boxing floats in and</v>

2669
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:31.840

<v Speaker 2>I like a last minute thing where I'm</v>

2670
01:52:31.841 --> 01:52:33.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can punch man,</v>

2671
01:52:33.671 --> 01:52:37.970
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to do whatever I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're preparing for mma?</v>

2672
01:52:37.971 --> 01:52:38.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2673
01:52:38.701 --> 01:52:40.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much different is your training?</v>

2674
01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Are you still taking more Thai fights as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2677
01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.200

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's coming next.</v>

2678
01:52:48.201 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 1>If it's going to be kickboxer I may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely preparing for both.</v>

2679
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:54.560
<v Speaker 1>And they haven't told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know yet because we don't know</v>

2680
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:55.260
<v Speaker 1>what Carla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2681
01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean my,</v>

2682
01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.540
<v Speaker 1>my mma training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we hit the paths,</v>

2683
01:52:59.541 --> 01:53:01.890
<v Speaker 1>as I stand differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm diff.</v>

2684
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm moved differently when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>training for MMA.</v>

2685
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a lot of MMA rounds actually</v>

2686
01:53:06.051 --> 01:53:06.884
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

2687
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:09.230
<v Speaker 1>with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from a team pseudo.</v>

2688
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good thing about mma is it'll still</v>

2689
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:14.290
<v Speaker 1>allow you to do spinning elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2690
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.280
<v Speaker 1>The bad thing about kickboxing is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do spinning elbows.</v>

2691
01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know.</v>

2692
01:53:18.361 --> 01:53:20.250
<v Speaker 1>That's one of your signature techniques</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

2693
01:53:20.251 --> 01:53:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Your signature technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mimo.</v>

2694
01:53:22.050 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had some spectacular knockouts in</v>

2695
01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:26.910
<v Speaker 1>lion fight was spinning elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2696
01:53:26.911 --> 01:53:29.720
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could they take that away?</v>

2697
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

2698
01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2699
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:33.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2700
01:53:33.201 --> 01:53:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really looking forward to doing both</v>

2701
01:53:34.821 --> 01:53:36.910
<v Speaker 1>to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to uh,</v>

2702
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving on my boxing and really having</v>

2703
01:53:39.231 --> 01:53:42.710
<v Speaker 1>to exercise that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that style of fighting and I'm really</v>

2704
01:53:42.711 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 1>looking forward to doing them in May as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2705
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:47.180
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were fighting 1:45 in lion</v>

2706
01:53:47.181 --> 01:53:49.810
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low 40 mma.</v>

2707
01:53:49.811 --> 01:53:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know yet.</v>

2708
01:53:50.811 --> 01:53:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably start at 1:45 then going</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to 35.</v>

2709
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You think you could make 1:35 big guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

2710
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I've made 1:39 last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do you weigh right now?</v>

2711
01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Probably like one 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:58.</v>

2712
01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:04.970
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just killing themselves.</v>

2713
01:54:05.210 --> 01:54:09.550
<v Speaker 1>That to me is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate aspects of fighting is the</v>

2714
01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.670
<v Speaker 1>drastic weight cuts and I just think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that juice is not worth the squeeze.</v>

2715
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like fighting itself is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn difficult.</v>

2716
01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Like why complicated even further by</v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydrating your brain 24 hours before</v>

2717
01:54:22.491 --> 01:54:23.160
<v Speaker 1>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2718
01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I cut down so much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working with my job for my</v>

2719
01:54:26.871 --> 01:54:30.560
<v Speaker 1>last three camps and has been great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is dolce got you doing differently?</v>

2720
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Just like the fact that he sent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sends me all my Diet's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you open them up and out of the cave is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meal prep company that we have out</v>

2727
01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 1>there in Dublin and Kevin sponsored by</v>
<v Speaker 1>them too,</v>

2728
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:55.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

2729
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I get my diet from dolce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give him my,</v>

2730
01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I give out of the cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet and I just get my meal prep</v>

2731
01:55:00.291 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 1>every week.</v>

2732
01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.693
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>

2733
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's jargon.</v>

2734
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It definitely makes it a lot easier to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have to worry about cooking and not</v>

2735
01:55:06.261 --> 01:55:08.840
<v Speaker 1>have to worry about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just training,</v>

2736
01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating and good desk.</v>

2737
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.490
<v Speaker 1>That is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2738
01:55:13.491 --> 01:55:17.390
<v Speaker 1>What is a primarily what kind of foods</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you eating and do very that.</v>

2739
01:55:17.391 --> 01:55:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And do you have different results with</v>
<v Speaker 1>different diets?</v>

2740
01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last diet was pretty good.</v>

2741
01:55:22.371 --> 01:55:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I will have like oats in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm oats in the morning with a chia</v>

2742
01:55:26.541 --> 01:55:28.460
<v Speaker 1>seeds and hemp seeds and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2743
01:55:29.150 --> 01:55:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll have my first workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my second meal will be eggs and then at</v>

2744
01:55:33.351 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 1>night I will have like fish or chicken</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that with asparagus or</v>

2745
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that to be really successful,</v>

2746
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:42.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

2747
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 1>if you do vary it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what</v>

2748
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:48.270
<v Speaker 3>do you various far as like the fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>content versus the carbohydrate content</v>

2749
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:49.920
<v Speaker 3>versus the protein content?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2750
01:55:49.921 --> 01:55:50.460
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2751
01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.200
<v Speaker 3>do you mess around with that at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use,</v>

2752
01:55:52.201 --> 01:55:57.201
<v Speaker 3>I used to do mostly a Paleo Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 90 percent Paleo except for a</v>

2753
01:55:57.841 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 3>little bit of milk in my coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I actually,</v>

2754
01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:05.010
<v Speaker 3>I had all these grains like oats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>brown rice at night and I feel great.</v>

2755
01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I feel better with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel better with that.</v>

2756
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the difference between adding</v>

2757
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:10.800
<v Speaker 3>the grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extra car?</v>

2758
01:56:10.810 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I have way more energy and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot more energy and my weight</v>

2759
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:17.850
<v Speaker 3>is even lower than it was when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to do,</v>

2760
01:56:17.851 --> 01:56:19.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all fruits and meats.</v>

2761
01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount of</v>

2762
01:56:21.991 --> 01:56:26.190
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates that a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are involved in like very strenuous</v>

2763
01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whether it's a triathletes or</v>

2764
01:56:28.831 --> 01:56:31.710
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that try,</v>

2765
01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:34.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the goal with a ketogenic diet.</v>

2766
01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I tried that a little bit and I just had</v>
<v Speaker 3>no energy.</v>

2767
01:56:37.711 --> 01:56:40.530
<v Speaker 3>It did not work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that like I was just like,</v>

2768
01:56:40.531 --> 01:56:42.690
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was brain dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did you do it for?</v>

2769
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It was like about a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And see that's the problem.</v>

2770
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:49.650
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to not even do anything</v>

2771
01:56:49.651 --> 01:56:52.980
<v Speaker 3>strenuous for the first three or four</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks to your body transitions.</v>

2772
01:56:52.981 --> 01:56:54.660
<v Speaker 3>So in my case I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2773
01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm always trying to get ready for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

2774
01:56:56.670 --> 01:56:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2775
01:56:57.631 --> 01:57:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I have no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know what they call the</v>

2776
01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Keto flu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2777
01:57:02.630 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 3>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some guys have made the</v>

2778
01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:06.960
<v Speaker 3>transition successfully and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2779
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.630
<v Speaker 3>they compete and they do a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>burning off fat.</v>

2780
01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 3>But I'm always curious about extreme</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2781
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:15.870
<v Speaker 3>like people that are doing ultra</v>
<v Speaker 3>marathons,</v>

2782
01:57:15.871 --> 01:57:20.820
<v Speaker 3>people that are doing things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme energy requirements,</v>

2783
01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:21.570
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2784
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I was living with the Karen at the</v>

2785
01:57:23.071 --> 01:57:25.380
<v Speaker 3>time and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like a little bit is I did,</v>

2786
01:57:25.381 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit for you.</v>

2787
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.480
<v Speaker 3>You need carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need,</v>

2788
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need that stuff.</v>

2789
01:57:32.551 --> 01:57:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have any juice,</v>

2790
01:57:33.971 --> 01:57:34.804
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2791
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to mark Sisson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he calls his diet the primal</v>

2792
01:57:39.301 --> 01:57:41.730
<v Speaker 3>blueprint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let the whole problem with the term</v>

2793
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the Paleolithic era?</v>

2794
01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:47.670
<v Speaker 3>They ate a lot of grains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just not historically</v>

2795
01:57:47.671 --> 01:57:49.320
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good word for it,</v>

2796
01:57:50.490 --> 01:57:53.550
<v Speaker 3>but the people that are successful with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2797
01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:55.800
<v Speaker 3>apparently it required.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

2798
01:57:55.801 --> 01:58:00.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a curve where you go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Keto flu stage for a few weeks and</v>

2799
01:58:00.571 --> 01:58:03.180
<v Speaker 3>then you get better than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've talked to people that never get</v>

2800
01:58:03.181 --> 01:58:05.040
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know some friends,</v>

2801
01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu friends that went through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole process and didn't train hard for</v>

2802
01:58:09.691 --> 01:58:13.290
<v Speaker 3>three or four weeks and got themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a state of Ketosis but just did not</v>

2803
01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 3>feel right.</v>

2804
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know it works for like power</v>

2805
01:58:15.631 --> 01:58:17.490
<v Speaker 3>lifters and stuff like that and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2806
01:58:17.491 --> 01:58:21.630
<v Speaker 3>but me as a fighter personally</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced it for a little bit.</v>

2807
01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I just would not do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your description shows me that you</v>

2808
01:58:25.171 --> 01:58:29.050
<v Speaker 3>didn't really get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the that you can't do it for two weeks.</v>

2809
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:31.680
<v Speaker 3>He told me like mark system when I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2810
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:34.230
<v Speaker 3>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything hard for three weeks</v>

2811
01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.380
<v Speaker 3>to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you like on the treadmill for 45</v>

2812
01:58:37.381 --> 01:58:39.390
<v Speaker 3>minutes just at a slow pace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably too much.</v>

2813
01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that was my mistake and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>training just</v>

2814
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 2>as hard as I always do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trying to eat like that.</v>

2815
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2816
01:58:45.070 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>it takes your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes your body awhile apparently to</v>

2817
01:58:48.251 --> 01:58:50.650
<v Speaker 3>make that adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is controversial.</v>

2818
01:58:50.651 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean it works for me and it works for</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>

2819
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:55.990
<v Speaker 3>but obviously my lifestyle doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same energy requirements that your</v>

2820
01:58:55.991 --> 01:58:57.120
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it mean training for</v>

2821
01:58:57.190 --> 01:58:59.190
<v Speaker 2>fights?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like all the things you've got to</v>

2822
01:58:59.191 --> 01:59:01.020
<v Speaker 2>find what works best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like,</v>

2823
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make the adjustments.</v>

2824
01:59:02.881 --> 01:59:05.340
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I need some more cars,</v>

2825
01:59:05.370 --> 01:59:09.570
<v Speaker 2>some more grains on a certain day or</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into a certain workout,</v>

2826
01:59:09.571 --> 01:59:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I wouldn't say I have a</v>

2827
01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 2>specific diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2828
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:14.670
<v Speaker 2>because it varies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2829
01:59:14.671 --> 01:59:16.170
<v Speaker 2>there's how I'm feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's working,</v>

2830
01:59:16.171 --> 01:59:17.350
<v Speaker 2>what's not working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2831
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:20.220
<v Speaker 2>which guys get blood work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get your blood work checked out,</v>

2832
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:24.450
<v Speaker 2>have a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy in vegas who does that and</v>

2833
01:59:24.451 --> 01:59:26.400
<v Speaker 2>a years back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2834
01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:27.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2835
01:59:27.081 --> 01:59:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I had my blood looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was messed up man.</v>

2836
01:59:29.131 --> 01:59:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of plaque in my blood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and I was really surprised.</v>

2837
01:59:33.681 --> 01:59:36.100
<v Speaker 2>It looked like it was really unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I never would have known that if I</v>

2838
01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:37.140
<v Speaker 2>never had gotten it done.</v>

2839

<v Speaker 2>like on unbelievable stuff,</v>

2956
02:04:01.451 --> 02:04:03.610
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of my more favorite books.</v>

2957
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2958
02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say I seek that out and like</v>

2959
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>look through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look for stories of inspiration,</v>

2960
02:04:10.541 --> 02:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just fighters but uh,</v>

2961
02:04:12.041 --> 02:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any order aspect of life in general.</v>

2962
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome.</v>

2963
02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said earlier,</v>

2964
02:04:19.571 --> 02:04:20.404
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2965
02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>if you go and look at anyone's story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's ever made it,</v>

2966
02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:26.230
<v Speaker 2>like you can take inspiration for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like seeing the struggles they went</v>

2967
02:04:26.231 --> 02:04:27.500
<v Speaker 2>through a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2968
02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>

2969
02:04:28.991 --> 02:04:29.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2970
02:04:30.130 --> 02:04:33.390
<v Speaker 2>when we don't know these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of ourselves as the only ones</v>

2971
02:04:33.391 --> 02:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>that have to overcome stuff or are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with things that might have</v>

2972
02:04:36.701 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 2>slowed down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're like,</v>

2973
02:04:37.861 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy had way worse than I ever did.</v>

2974
02:04:39.930 --> 02:04:41.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I've always treated,</v>

2975
02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>tried to be very vocal about the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've struggled with and overcome.</v>

2976
02:04:45.631 --> 02:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>And like the first highlight video I</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever had done for me,</v>

2977
02:04:48.330 --> 02:04:52.080
<v Speaker 2>it was very important for me to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself getting knocked out and dropped</v>

2978
02:04:52.081 --> 02:04:53.010
<v Speaker 2>in all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2979
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:56.250
<v Speaker 2>everyone just shows these highlights of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life and it gives you a very</v>

2980
02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:59.720
<v Speaker 2>skewed perception of what it is we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with and go through,</v>

2981
02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>especially to reach a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2982
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:03.480
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2983
02:05:03.481 --> 02:05:07.440
<v Speaker 2>that we go through a lot and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know because you just see the end</v>

2984
02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:11.300
<v Speaker 2>result of all this hard work and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glamour and the lights and the</v>

2985
02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:12.680
<v Speaker 2>highlights and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2986
02:05:12.681 --> 02:05:15.600
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know what people have felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>overhead come with and dealt with things</v>

2987
02:05:15.601 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I would crush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most people,</v>

2988
02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I think what's really important about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2989
02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:24.560
<v Speaker 3>inspirational videos and books and</v>
<v Speaker 3>biographies and things along those lines</v>

2990
02:05:24.590 --> 02:05:29.370
<v Speaker 3>is it gives you an insight into</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's perspective that you,</v>

2991
02:05:30.170 --> 02:05:32.030
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find parallels,</v>

2992
02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:36.560
<v Speaker 3>you find parallels to your own life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it normalizes some things that might</v>

2993
02:05:36.561 --> 02:05:38.930
<v Speaker 3>just seem incredibly confusing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe to you,</v>

2994
02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:42.140
<v Speaker 3>it's the first time you've had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome something that's so difficult,</v>

2995
02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:44.750
<v Speaker 3>but then you find out that other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have done it as well.</v>

2996
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:46.460
<v Speaker 3>And it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2997
02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:47.120
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2998
02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.670
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take a lot of comfort in people</v>

2999
02:05:49.671 --> 02:05:50.570
<v Speaker 3>that have gone before you.</v>

3000
02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we've all had to overcome</v>

3001
02:05:53.671 --> 02:05:55.350
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3002
02:05:55.351 --> 02:05:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Like just sitting down and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like hearing their story,</v>

3003
02:05:59.370 --> 02:05:59.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3004
02:05:59.931 --> 02:06:00.764
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3005
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:03.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be very inspirational and really</v>

3006
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:05.850
<v Speaker 2>help you overcome anything you might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing.</v>

3007
02:06:05.851 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I've always been tried to be</v>

3008
02:06:07.981 --> 02:06:12.981
<v Speaker 2>very vocal about my story and share some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my fight experiences or training</v>

3009
02:06:13.411 --> 02:06:15.360
<v Speaker 2>experience or life experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

3010
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:16.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't.</v>

3011
02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:18.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever hear that side of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3012
02:06:18.201 --> 02:06:18.960
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3013
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:21.150
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fame if you want to call it that.</v>

3014
02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't see that we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get put out there like,</v>

3015
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:25.600
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the successes.</v>

3016
02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see everyone's success.</v>

3017
02:06:27.511 --> 02:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't see their failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3018
02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.420
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about you.</v>

3019
02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:35.560
<v Speaker 3>You're obviously a very intelligent guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're a guy who's gone through a</v>

3020
02:06:35.561 --> 02:06:38.440
<v Speaker 3>lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also a guy who wants other</v>

3021
02:06:38.441 --> 02:06:41.380
<v Speaker 3>people to know that you've gone through</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things.</v>

3022
02:06:41.381 --> 02:06:43.460
<v Speaker 3>You're a guy who wants you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3023
02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:46.090
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're assuming not just this role of a</v>

3024
02:06:46.091 --> 02:06:48.550
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also assuming role as a</v>

3025
02:06:48.551 --> 02:06:53.410
<v Speaker 3>mentor and have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an example to those who are coming up.</v>

3026
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's been very</v>

3027
02:06:55.521 --> 02:07:00.380
<v Speaker 2>important to me because like as I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up before youtube and everything,</v>

3028
02:07:00.381 --> 02:07:02.330
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't really have anyone to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at me like,</v>

3029
02:07:02.331 --> 02:07:03.710
<v Speaker 2>well he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it too.</v>

3030
02:07:04.130 --> 02:07:07.550
<v Speaker 2>So it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still is very important to me.</v>

3031
02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:10.790
<v Speaker 2>One of the most important things to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to show people that they can do it,</v>

3032
02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:12.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

3033
02:07:12.190 --> 02:07:15.900
<v Speaker 2>to show people when I say how late I</v>
<v Speaker 2>started in,</v>

3034
02:07:15.901 --> 02:07:17.960
<v Speaker 2>in where I was and the things I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome,</v>

3035
02:07:17.961 --> 02:07:21.050
<v Speaker 2>because when you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've seen that someone's done it</v>

3036
02:07:21.051 --> 02:07:23.600
<v Speaker 2>before you or similar and overcome these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

3037
02:07:23.601 --> 02:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it makes it that much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3038
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:28.520
<v Speaker 2>for the next person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a really amazing book called the</v>

3039
02:07:28.521 --> 02:07:30.480
<v Speaker 2>rise of Superman and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're read it,</v>

3040
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:32.220
<v Speaker 2>they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3041
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.800
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

3042
02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:35.900
<v Speaker 2>the leaps we've made an athletic.</v>

3043
02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:36.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3044
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more talking about like extreme</v>

3045
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:39.710
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

3046
02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:41.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about was the,</v>

3047
02:07:41.291 --> 02:07:41.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3048
02:07:41.771 --> 02:07:45.670
<v Speaker 2>the four minute mile and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that used to be physically thought of as</v>

3049
02:07:45.671 --> 02:07:49.210
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas now it becomes a requirement for</v>

3050
02:07:49.211 --> 02:07:51.490
<v Speaker 2>people to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like kids in high school are doing</v>

3051
02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>it where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were they used to think of it like</v>

3052
02:07:53.471 --> 02:07:55.270
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can physically do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

3053
02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were there.</v>

3054
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:59.500
<v Speaker 2>They brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like the $900 on a</v>

3055
02:07:59.501 --> 02:08:01.790
<v Speaker 2>skateboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was impossible to do,</v>

3056
02:08:01.791 --> 02:08:05.350
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's no way you can do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a Tony Hawk or whoever did it</v>

3057
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.980
<v Speaker 2>and now like eight year old kids can</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull this off because you,</v>

3058
02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that thing that's viewed as impossible</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes the norm and as soon as that</v>

3059
02:08:13.001 --> 02:08:14.860
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get to the next level and the</v>

3060
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:15.760
<v Speaker 2>next level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next level,</v>

3061
02:08:15.761 --> 02:08:19.330
<v Speaker 2>and the only way to do that is for</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to break through whatever that</v>

3062
02:08:19.331 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 2>impossible thing is and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if these things aren't put out there</v>

3063
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:26.080
<v Speaker 2>and people don't know about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still always viewing that,</v>

3064
02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:27.100
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3065
02:08:27.101 --> 02:08:30.340
<v Speaker 2>that barrier as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as this is as high as we can go</v>

3066
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:31.820
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that sense,</v>

3067
02:08:31.821 --> 02:08:34.400
<v Speaker 3>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think of yourself or view</v>

3068
02:08:34.401 --> 02:08:36.740
<v Speaker 3>yourself as a part of this process?</v>

3069
02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.970
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3070
02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like I've always known</v>

3071
02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:46.890
<v Speaker 2>were speaking about Moitai where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the sport could go.</v>

3072
02:08:47.190 --> 02:08:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3073
02:08:48.091 --> 02:08:50.610
<v Speaker 2>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought I'd still be actively</v>

3074
02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:54.810
<v Speaker 2>doing it while it got out there and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exposure it's been getting recently.</v>

3075
02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always knew I would be a person</v>

3076
02:08:57.781 --> 02:09:01.470
<v Speaker 2>that helped it go along and that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge thing that kept me from ever</v>

3077
02:09:01.710 --> 02:09:05.970
<v Speaker 2>venturing fulltime into mma or into</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing because I was like,</v>

3078
02:09:05.971 --> 02:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>there's only a handful of us doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Joe Schilling and Tiffany and</v>

3079
02:09:09.961 --> 02:09:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Chi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3080
02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:12.600
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3081
02:09:12.601 --> 02:09:14.760
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's only a handful of us doing</v>

3082
02:09:14.761 --> 02:09:18.570
<v Speaker 2>this at this level and going out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and taking these almost impossible</v>

3083
02:09:18.571 --> 02:09:21.050
<v Speaker 2>fights and I leave who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

3084
02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:22.590
<v Speaker 2>who is there to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's gonna do this?</v>

3085
02:09:22.591 --> 02:09:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll be somebodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got To go through the gate and get</v>

3086
02:09:25.141 --> 02:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>bloodied up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3087
02:09:26.130 --> 02:09:28.240
<v Speaker 2>that first person that has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3088
02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:30.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't like pass this off on somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

3089
02:09:30.601 --> 02:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I can't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's going to make it that much</v>

3090
02:09:32.701 --> 02:09:34.080
<v Speaker 2>harder for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3091
02:09:34.081 --> 02:09:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like I needed to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration I wanted to see in the</v>

3092
02:09:38.221 --> 02:09:38.940
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3093
02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you find a great benefit and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to train with him?</v>

3094
02:09:41.851 --> 02:09:42.684
<v Speaker 3>Because</v>

3095
02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:47.120
<v Speaker 2>when we first started training together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will do it.</v>

3096
02:09:47.121 --> 02:09:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll get this adrenaline dumps when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was sparring with them,</v>

3097
02:09:49.731 --> 02:09:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3098
02:09:51.801 --> 02:09:53.870
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is I'm sparring with Kevin</v>

3099
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:56.360

<v Speaker 2>And then slowly it will get better.</v>

3100
02:09:56.361 --> 02:09:59.660
<v Speaker 2>And like now we've become great training</v>
<v Speaker 2>partners and he's been a huge part of my</v>

3101
02:09:59.661 --> 02:10:02.000
<v Speaker 2>career obviously.</v>
