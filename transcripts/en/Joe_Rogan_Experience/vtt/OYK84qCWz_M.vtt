<v Speaker 2>I think Hillary was Boehner's.</v>

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.430

<v Speaker 2>Definitely didn't have the sound</v>

8
00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 2>dampening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you know it's a real podcast</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

23
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started out in the belly room.</v>

24
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you came in great.</v>

25
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I came back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the store.</v>

26
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 2>When I came to see that show in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>belly room.</v>

27
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

28
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 2>It was the day before Ari film this</v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

29
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't been to the store in seven</v>

30
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>years and I remember I came here for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Improv that night.</v>

31
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen you a couple,</v>

32
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>a tip and Finney at the Improv Aranow I</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept talking about it.</v>

33
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 2>That's where I was doing sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of made it a personal mission to</v>

34
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 2>bring you back to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 2>sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And roast battle was the bait.</v>

36
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he roast battle definitely helped to</v>

37
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>also because it was so electric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

38
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on in this</v>

39
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love doing the show so much.</v>

40
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>And the comics love doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only competition show where</v>

41
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>comics who aren't even on the show come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch other comics.</v>

42
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

43
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the rare shows were comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to watch.</v>

44
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Other comics were shooting in the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>house of blues across the street.</v>

45
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 2>They're knocking it down and a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks of building condos forever.</v>

46
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Very historic building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy.</v>

47
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>So our producer Joel and had the idea to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go in there,</v>

48
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 2>pull the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll clean it up.</v>

49
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 2>There was like all kinds of stuff living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

50
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 2>And we built our roast battle arena</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the old house of Blues for four</v>

51
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this is happening.</v>

52
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>you know the early days of wrestling or</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting or something.</v>

54
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn it into condos.</v>

55
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 2>That stuff's hard to realize that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to have across the</v>

56
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

57
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 2>But maybe it will be good in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I bet a lot of comics who are just</v>

58
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 2>going to get a fucking apartment there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can afford it,</v>

59
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 2>that'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stumble out of bar across the street</v>

60
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not live there?</v>

61
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

62
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have a reluctant girl,</v>

63
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're uh,</v>

104
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:23.531
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

105
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

106
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 2>he had like an allergic reaction to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug or something.</v>

107
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.750
<v Speaker 2>They're like a blood clot or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

108
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Something you think some people think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Chinese triad had?</v>

109
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm whacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

110
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know his son Brandon died on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the set of a movie where they had a fake</v>

112
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 3>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a gun with a blank and they shot at</v>

113
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 3>him and there was something inside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gun and it wound up killing him.</v>

114
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a way to go.</v>

115
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Was it a stunt man who shot him or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another way?</v>

116
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it was another actor and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>from then on,</v>

117
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 3>they now they made a new rule after</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

118
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I think this might be bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the new rule was what I had</v>

119
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:05.940
<v Speaker 3>heard was that you can't point a gun at</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone when you shoot them.</v>

120
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Like instead of shooting you with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>blank,</v>

121
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:09.990
<v Speaker 3>if you and I were in a movie and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to shoot you the blank,</v>

122
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it looks like from over there that</v>

123
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:15.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm shooting at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm really shooting to the left of</v>

124
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

125
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

126
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess I never realized that syteline</v>
<v Speaker 2>is weird.</v>

127
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember his brother,</v>

128
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>the chro or the sun rather than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie the crow.</v>

129
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It was cool and they did after they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a finish it without them or something.</v>

130
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to like hire some guy to</v>

131
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>pretend to be him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 2017 we're almost done with</v>

132
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 2>January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It not one major celebrity has died in</v>

133
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 2>any way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How amazing.</v>

135
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>How many dropped off right before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end though.</v>

136
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Carrie Fisher was a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

137
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Who else died?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prince.</v>

138
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Prince George.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael.</v>

139
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>David Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prince is a bad one,</v>

140
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died from fucking pain pills.</v>

141
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>It would go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lost fish a year ago.</v>

142
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beginning of</v>

143
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 4>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

144
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 4>Tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have about 75 years old.</v>

145
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 4>He was at least that old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it about Barney is sag number</v>

146
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 4>was three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Barney Miller,</v>

147
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that a those onto a plate shot?</v>

148
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 4>Barney Miller and then he had fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was on his own show.</v>

149
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 4>He was in the godfather movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That true.</v>

150
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 4>He had to spin off though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

151
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 4>If fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

152
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 4>That was this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was also,</v>

153
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 4>that shows only on one season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But everyone remembers it</v>

154
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.650
<v Speaker 4>for one season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never heard of it.</v>

155
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 4>You didn't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fish lasted one season and everyone</v>

156
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:30.914
<v Speaker 4>remembers it.</v>

157
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that you know,</v>

158
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 3>you know you've been on tv a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times and you know you've had your own</v>

159
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 3>show and now you've got rose paddle on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's so many shows on</v>

160
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 3>now with so many networks and so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>channels and then the streaming shit</v>

161
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 3>like Netflix and Hulu and you know CSO</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a million and it's almost like</v>

162
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 3>there's too much content.</v>

163
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just for some reason more</v>
<v Speaker 4>narrowed.</v>

164
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 4>You know you get your exact audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

165
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know like Doug Benson had something</v>

166
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 4>for pot smokers and someone else has</v>
<v Speaker 4>something for home improvement and then</v>

167
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a 30 a channel just for cooking</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows and it's kind of like that I guess</v>

168
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.580
<v Speaker 4>a otherwise it's hard to understand.</v>

169
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to get people to know about</v>

170
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:16.320
<v Speaker 3>your show just from TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

171
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 3>You need like some sort of a web</v>
<v Speaker 3>presence and some sort of a social media</v>

172
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 3>presence and something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like regular shows.</v>

173
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Like if you just put it on after a</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful show,</v>

174
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just change the channel to</v>

175
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 3>something they do know.</v>

176
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

177
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 4>There's almost too many things going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

178
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's hard about it.</v>

179
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 4>It's launching any TV show and roared</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing our show is a tournament like as</v>

180
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:40.450
<v Speaker 4>an event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by the time you even know it's on,</v>

181
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>

182
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so good.</v>

183
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't lose.</v>

184
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a show.</v>

185
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 3>When when they said that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to turn that into a television show,</v>

186
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that campus,</v>

187
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 3>it can't miss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

188
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you could figure out a way</v>

189
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 3>to do them all in the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like the belly room is</v>

190
00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 3>something special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

191
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 3>The magic is something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so intimate.</v>

192
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you see someone get fucking</v>

193
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 3>crushed in the belly room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've heard some goddamn titanic</v>

194
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 3>lines up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did Kim Kong did say about this</v>

195
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 3>girl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

196
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said she's not union but her tits or</v>

197
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:16.904
<v Speaker 3>sad.</v>

198
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 4>It really is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Writers showcase.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's kind of great.</v>

215
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 2>We're downstairs below the original</v>
<v Speaker 2>rooms</v>

216
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 2>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're going to call it</v>

217
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>underground at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're underground.</v>

222
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 2>he can hear comics killing up there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hear the piano music.</v>

223
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking oss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a real feel to it bro.</v>

224
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shaved your eyebrows.</v>

225
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I ran into you in New York five months</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and you had shaved your eyebrows.</v>

226
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 2>How do I look now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of not fit back yet.</v>

227
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm a strange looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan.</v>

228
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long has it taken for eyebrows to</v>

229
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 2>grow back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a lifetime.</v>

230
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>

231
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought eyebrows would be like a</v>

232
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 2>beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't really have hair on my</v>

233
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel like your body here.</v>

234
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Like my sister's never shaved her legs.</v>

241
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to Hitler's bunker.</v>

242
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we geva no.</v>

243
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 2>How would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was your set?</v>

244
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was one of those crowds where if you</v>

245
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 5>did new shit that you were excited</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

246
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 5>they were with you and as soon as you</v>
<v Speaker 5>did a bit that had any dust on it,</v>

247
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 5>they just fucking flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you think</v>

248
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 2>that was you or they felt they felt it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you</v>

249
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.000
<v Speaker 5>always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely me.</v>

250
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.680
<v Speaker 5>It was me because I felt like when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have new stuff,</v>

251
00:10:42.681 --> 00:10:46.610
<v Speaker 5>you get so excited about doing it that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you come alive and you're,</v>

252
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:48.830
<v Speaker 5>you're not reciting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're really saying it.</v>

253
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.070
<v Speaker 5>And then when the transition into shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you've been doing for too long,</v>

254
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 5>you lose that freshness and they sensed</v>
<v Speaker 5>this as difference between the,</v>

255
00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:57.110
<v Speaker 5>the material.</v>

256
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a moment when you're doing an</v>
<v Speaker 2>old bit where you're,</v>

257
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 2>you have so much shame and you try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried to like reignite it,</v>

258
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.170
<v Speaker 2>power it up and it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

259
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.270
<v Speaker 2>why am I still doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking shitty.</v>

260
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

261
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you see a guy yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 5>his son and a parking lot and he doesn't</v>

262
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:16.810
<v Speaker 5>even believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just doing it because he thinks</v>

263
00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:17.980
<v Speaker 5>that's how it filed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They suppose that,</v>

264
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

265
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what's even worse is when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see someone yelling at their kid and</v>

266
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:25.390
<v Speaker 2>then you look over and you make eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact with them and they realize they</v>

267
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:27.790
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be yelling at their kid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost their cool.</v>

268
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine you are looking at a guy</v>

269
00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:32.380
<v Speaker 2>who was yelling at his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a little bit of a</v>

270
00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:34.600
<v Speaker 2>medicine left on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to be,</v>

271
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I try to be kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

272
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be menacing to parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>or audiences for them.</v>

273
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't yell at my kids,</v>

274
00:11:43.091 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might raise my voice occasionally if</v>

275
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:48.070
<v Speaker 2>we're doing something really fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're being mean to each other.</v>

276
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.390
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I remember people yelling at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man like that the cortisol rhythm</v>

278
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 2>that happens in a kid's brain and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those stress hormones that get released,</v>

280
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's plenty of fucking bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit going on in the world.</v>

281
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't need their parents yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 2>him too well,</v>

282
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 2>especially when you put it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

283
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>like your parent at any given time is</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly three or four times bigger than</v>

284
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.801
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

285
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And then when they yell at you on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

286
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 2>that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking intimidating.</v>

287
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of pussies.</v>

288
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have kids become a pussy.</v>

289
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 2>You definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a certain way you become a pussy.</v>

290
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely,</v>

291
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the good thing about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me not yelling is my fucking six year</v>

292
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 2>old is not even remotely scared of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even a little shit.</v>

293
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 2>She mocks me like openly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I go,</v>

294
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 2>hey listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

295
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 2>She sticks her tongue out at me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not even like a little nervous</v>

297
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 2>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe I should be a little harder.</v>

298
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Just leave some videotapes a you doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jiu Jitsu on somebody just in a loop.</v>

299
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>White teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I teach my kids,</v>

300
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take martial arts and my six year</v>

301
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 2>old is actually a higher rank than my a</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight year old.</v>

302
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

303
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that gives them the confidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk smack at you now.</v>

304
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hits me.</v>

305
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I can block it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

306
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think they know I'm not going to</v>

307
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:07.470
<v Speaker 2>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

308
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.100
<v Speaker 2>they beat the shit out of me though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're allowed to hit me like a cause.</v>

309
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of practice techniques</v>
<v Speaker 2>on me.</v>

310
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I laugh at them full blast leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So especially my eight year old,</v>

311
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 2>she could fucking hit hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll like step into a leg kick and</v>

312
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.050
<v Speaker 2>cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

313
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 2>she lets me know she's going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I let her do it so she could feel</v>

314
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to hit a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as hard as you want.</v>

315
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're her meat puppet.</v>

316
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

317
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You know Jeff Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black belt in taekwondo.</v>

318
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I did know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

319
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.830
<v Speaker 2>What year did you begin to digress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not even 11 host who's a junior</v>

320
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 2>black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy Buddy.</v>

321
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice though.</v>

322
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.900
<v Speaker 2>It says it's great if you find a major</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack,</v>

323
00:13:47.901 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 2>but I had a teach adults in order to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>my black belt,</v>

324
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he really to teach adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

325
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 2>That was part of the test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn a lot when you teach.</v>

326
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your son's a black belt,</v>

327
00:13:58.451 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

328
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Junior black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior black belt,</v>

329
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 2>and he did it for like eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of different schools that I've</v>

330
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>looked at that age was pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's tough is once they get the black</v>

331
00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not new forms to learn.</v>

332
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just perfecting what you've already</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned and a lot does a big dropoff</v>

333
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.340
<v Speaker 2>because kids are so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're so used to getting a new</v>

334
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 2>belt and learning new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it?</v>

335
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Katas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

336
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.860
<v Speaker 2>depending on it's either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

337
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what,</v>

338
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 2>what style Art Katas is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese word and it depends on what</v>

339
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 2>martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Taekwondo,</v>

340
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I think they called it wasn't boom says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

341
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's different for other styles of</v>

342
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Korean martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a different name for it too,</v>

343
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

344
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Well you can go to higher degrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

345
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.780
<v Speaker 2>You can get like a second degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Third,</v>

346
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:48.410
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

347
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It takes a different mentality to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that level.</v>

348
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a thing,</v>

349
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once people achieve black belt,</v>

350
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

351
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain has been climbed.</v>

352
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that you'd done.</v>

353
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Well I guess he kind of have that at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>

354
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 2>but TACO window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a lot of,</v>

355
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like light contact sparring,</v>

356
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

357
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

358
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not as engaging as like Jiu Jitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Ju Jitsu is kind of like full</v>

359
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 2>blast because you're not hitting each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

360
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>You just like doing chokes and arm bars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

361
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And as long as someone has control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

362
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't hurt you.</v>

363
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:25.341
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

364
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 2>when someone is in a bad position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like if you know you have</v>

365
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 2>someone's arm and there it's totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>locked out.</v>

366
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're not tapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to break it.</v>

367
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 2>You know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

368
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 2>like when it's breaking and when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

369
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually just wait till somebody gets</v>

370
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we call it a day.</v>

371
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you finish them off?</v>

372
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah man.</v>

373
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 5>I was just saying any joke last night on</v>
<v Speaker 5>your shell and just kind of came up,</v>

374
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:50.290
<v Speaker 5>but somebody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

375
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 5>I see this guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd have sex with you.</v>

376
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.160
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

377
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:54.921
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's nice.</v>

378
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

379
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'd be the top.</v>

380
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.080
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course you'd be the top.</v>

381
00:16:01.081 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 5>Because the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was fucking me is I'm flat on my</v>

382
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 5>face and you just tackled me and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably a threeway.</v>

383
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way I'm getting fucked</v>
<v Speaker 5>as these two guys and I'm the bottom.</v>

384
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:17.350
<v Speaker 5>There's something there could be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the closest he ever came to fool</v>

385

<v Speaker 2>This is part of the problem with being</v>

00:16:40.031 --> 00:16:41.860
<v Speaker 2>the roastmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think someone's going to use this</v>

<v Speaker 5>Soft under belly.</v>

397

<v Speaker 2>I look at like who I would be fun to</v>

450
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:11.340
<v Speaker 1>This is like a rigid thing where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hit it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>was when he became president.</v>

468
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.221
<v Speaker 2>When he won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He made fun of her in a debate and one</v>

471
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>of the debates he was talking like</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone said he talked bad about women.</v>

472
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.890

<v Speaker 2>It was after that,</v>

477
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 2>like after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was just like crushed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was talking about how sad she was</v>

479
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 2>and I like she couldn't go outside and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been seen as kid.</v>

480
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Does he look autistic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suck a fucking kid know he's a tall,</v>

481
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:33.560
<v Speaker 2>good looking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a launch kit.</v>

482
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.690
<v Speaker 2>He gave him Rhode Island for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comedy store.</v>

483
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Well the kids 10 and he's 70 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 5>shot one in Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the thing is now you just think</v>

486
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:54.370
<v Speaker 5>about how much your cell phone is in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your pocket,</v>

487
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 5>how many waves are going through your</v>
<v Speaker 5>Siem and all the time you don't put it</v>

488
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 5>in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do.</v>

489
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.510
<v Speaker 5>Why does everybody think that radiation</v>
<v Speaker 5>is bad?</v>

490
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I remember when we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

491
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Comic Book Guys got Radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the heroes,</v>

492
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.130
<v Speaker 2>but then became heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't sit too close to the TV they used</v>

493
00:21:11.131 --> 00:21:11.911
<v Speaker 2>to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

494
00:21:11.911 --> 00:21:13.980
<v Speaker 2>they were worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that was for your eyes.</v>

495
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.443
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

496
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>like radiation in comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always does.</v>

497
00:21:18.421 --> 00:21:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Good Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

498
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get the right.</v>

499
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.680
<v Speaker 2>People go radiation when they're ill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a healing thing now.</v>

500
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do to kill the tumor,</v>

501
00:21:29.011 --> 00:21:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but it kills you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just kills the tumor more that it</v>

502
00:21:32.761 --> 00:21:35.100
<v Speaker 2>kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kills the tumor first and it brings</v>

503
00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:40.101
<v Speaker 2>you to the door of death and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull back and start drinking wheat grass</v>

504
00:21:40.201 --> 00:21:41.340
<v Speaker 2>juice and getting your life together.</v>

505
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just started some probiotics online</v>

506
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:44.920

513
00:21:56.101 --> 00:21:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that Kim Cheat?</v>

514
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotics is,</v>

515
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 2>anytime you're taking in like healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>

516
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.690
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in the form of yogurt,</v>

517
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Acidophilus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Sauerkraut is actually a healthy,</v>

518
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 2>especially raw sauerkraut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually a very good probiotic.</v>

519
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good for you.</v>

520
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of like natural food</v>
<v Speaker 2>stores,</v>

521
00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 2>like whole foods type places that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotic sauerkrauts really good for</v>

522
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you because it's fermented and anytime</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fermenting something,</v>

523
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is like this bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

524
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

525
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living on the food.</v>

526
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.950
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're eating Kimchi,</v>

527
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:35.710
<v Speaker 2>there's bacteria living on the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's healthy bacteria.</v>

528
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

529
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 5>Cause I fart so bad and it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been years,</v>

530
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.720
<v Speaker 5>I think it caught grd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I was down in Florida really?</v>

531
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 5>And it just rings or creek,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no tap water in Florida,</v>

532
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to drink it.</v>

533
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst tap water in America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because it's a sandbar,</v>

534
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:52.690
<v Speaker 5>there's no fucking fresh water down</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

535
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's an all tap water treated with</v>

536
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 5>chlorine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

537
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.310
<v Speaker 5>But there's only so much they can do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with that shit down there.</v>

538
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.920
<v Speaker 5>Look at those people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I started farting and it just,</v>

539
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:04.870
<v Speaker 5>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went on all kinds of antibiotics and I</v>

540
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 5>got rid of like a bulk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the farts have remained.</v>

541
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 5>And so somebody told me to probe</v>
<v Speaker 5>probiotics can clear it up if you ever</v>

542
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:13.740
<v Speaker 5>heard that when people get poop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

543
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 5>transfusions now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

544
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:17.870
<v Speaker 5>They'll take poop from a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 5>personal,</v>

545
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.690
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

546
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.150
<v Speaker 5>It's a real fast to ass.</v>

547
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't make you go,</v>

548
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but I think they go in and fish it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they shoot it up in you.</v>

549
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally will shoot somebody</v>

<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

551
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people even swallow poop</v>

552
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:36.230
<v Speaker 2>tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

554
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

555
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.823
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>

556
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people that have like really</v>

557
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.020
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy gut biomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>

558
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of people is antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you take antibiotics,</v>

559
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just kill the bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kills good stuff too.</v>

560
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just had the first woman who</v>

561
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be cured by antibiotics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read about that?</v>

562
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

563
00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 2>she had some kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>

564
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:02.580
<v Speaker 2>It was some kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bacteria commercial.</v>

565
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

566
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew more about the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

567
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

568
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can look it up on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the first time that they</v>

569
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:16.310
<v Speaker 2>tried every type of antibiotic and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work and they said that this</v>

570
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:20.070
<v Speaker 2>could mark the beginning of untreatable</v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses.</v>

571
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So bacteria virus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess bacteria.</v>

572
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Bacteria is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't treat viruses with</v>

573
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

574
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 2>You tune antiviral medications a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different thing,</v>

575
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

577
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:39.310
<v Speaker 2>staph infections and stuff like that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten stronger and stronger over the</v>

<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's tons of good stuff.</v>

702
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the cheap fucking route is to</v>

703
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:01.440
<v Speaker 5>say that religion sucks just because</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a blunt,</v>

704
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 5>easy blanket to go fuck religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just caused every war.</v>

705
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

706
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of fucking negatives to</v>

707
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:08.310
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

708
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

709
00:30:08.871 --> 00:30:12.510
<v Speaker 3>that blamed it on every war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But war is something that's caused by</v>

710
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:15.540
<v Speaker 3>people and people would have found a</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason to go to war.</v>

711
00:30:15.541 --> 00:30:19.530
<v Speaker 3>They go to war because they're apes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to war because apes fight</v>

712
00:30:19.531 --> 00:30:21.900
<v Speaker 3>against apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're always dominating for</v>

713
00:30:21.901 --> 00:30:24.720
<v Speaker 3>that Alpha position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're blaming it on religion,</v>

714
00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:27.300
<v Speaker 3>it's just a convenient reason to go fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody up.</v>

715
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.630
<v Speaker 3>They would have done it if they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds or they'd do it for oil.</v>

716
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing in Ireland,</v>

717
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 5>they try to pretend that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a war between the Protestants and</v>

718
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:36.431
<v Speaker 5>the Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

719
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:40.870
<v Speaker 5>it's the fucking Brits trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>colonize and destroy a population of</v>

720
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

721
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.360
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

722
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.430
<v Speaker 3>And people get tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

723
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will fight.</v>

724
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.820
<v Speaker 3>The fucking raiders will fight the</v>
<v Speaker 3>eagles.</v>

725
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.240
<v Speaker 3>You know the fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll meet in the parking lot and have a</v>

726
00:30:51.241 --> 00:30:56.010
<v Speaker 3>fucking gang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just what people do for a shirt</v>

727
00:30:56.011 --> 00:30:58.350
<v Speaker 3>color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want the people do mean didn't</v>

728
00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:01.280
<v Speaker 3>they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They beat some guy almost to death in</v>

729
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.720
<v Speaker 3>dodger stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put him in a coma.</v>

730
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco Fan.</v>

731
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Some guy with his kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

732
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kids.</v>

733
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.810
<v Speaker 5>His kids with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was dead.</v>

734
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.400
<v Speaker 5>Two dudes just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the kid was autistic,</v>

735
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.100
<v Speaker 5>was he was going to say help himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His</v>

736
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 3>instincts took over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was autistic.</v>

737
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy how tribal people are</v>

738
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing with the selection too,</v>

739
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.480
<v Speaker 3>whether you're a trump supporter or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary supporter or a Bernie supporter,</v>

740
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just can step back from it for a</v>

741
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:35.770
<v Speaker 3>second and look at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're seeing is these people that</v>

742
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:40.771
<v Speaker 3>are like blindly loyal to one side or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other and then you just see giant</v>

743
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 3>clumps of them that move in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction and very few people who look</v>

744
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:50.050
<v Speaker 3>at it and have like a balanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that's outside of like an</v>

745
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:51.440
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very.</v>

746
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

747
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Like very few people are going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

748
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 3>we got this guy who won a popularity</v>
<v Speaker 3>contest and he's the first actually</v>

749
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:03.160
<v Speaker 3>popular person who wants popularity</v>
<v Speaker 3>contest and everybody else who's been</v>

750
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:04.390
<v Speaker 3>one of its popularity contest.</v>

751
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.610
<v Speaker 3>It's just spinning this one select</v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

752
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:11.320
<v Speaker 3>So in that sense it's a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's going to be a disruptive</v>

753
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:14.920
<v Speaker 3>thing and this system is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good to have the same fucking</v>

754
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 3>families run the country over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>again and have the same bureaucracy,</v>

755
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 3>that same red tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the shit that people have had to</v>

756
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 3>deal with when it comes to politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not a perfect system and it's</v>

757
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:26.620
<v Speaker 3>not getting improved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons it doesn't get</v>

758
00:32:26.621 --> 00:32:29.120
<v Speaker 3>improved just cause the people that run</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system have a,</v>

759
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>

760
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a concerted,</v>

761
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great benefit for them to keep</v>

762
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 3>the system in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of job,</v>

763
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of red tape.</v>

764
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>There's of confused as plenty</v>

765
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:45.070
<v Speaker 2>of debate in influence and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it goes back and forth from side to</v>

766
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 2>side and all that keeps it relevant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps people from stopping and</v>

767
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.440
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are there these two groups?</v>

768
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.310
<v Speaker 2>One is right and one is left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's conservative ones liberal.</v>

769
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 2>When most of us are a combination of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

770
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

771
00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:00.940
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

772
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:05.970
<v Speaker 6>it's all projections by the big business</v>
<v Speaker 6>to say there's even a right and a left.</v>

773
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.380
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've got both there pulling the</v>

774
00:33:08.381 --> 00:33:09.910
<v Speaker 6>strings on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

775
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was saying that,</v>

776
00:33:11.401 --> 00:33:13.750
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I remember like coming around the</v>

777
00:33:13.751 --> 00:33:16.570
<v Speaker 7>store and listen to people at the</v>
<v Speaker 7>beginning of the campaign in trump's</v>

778
00:33:16.571 --> 00:33:17.710
<v Speaker 7>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

779
00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:21.760
<v Speaker 7>like vehemently hated him so much and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that kind of like extremism was the</v>

780
00:33:21.761 --> 00:33:24.490
<v Speaker 7>same for like Bernie support.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the Bernie chaos.</v>

781
00:33:24.491 --> 00:33:27.490
<v Speaker 7>Like the Bernie thing was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was like the same kind of</v>

782
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.870
<v Speaker 7>crazy Catholic like fuck anybody but</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bernie and the trump supporters are the</v>

783
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:32.704
<v Speaker 7>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

784
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.640
<v Speaker 7>fuck anybody but Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like extremes on both sides.</v>

785
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.040
<v Speaker 7>And it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At some point you're,</v>

786
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.420
<v Speaker 7>you're on a level plane,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

787
00:33:40.421 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 7>Zero is the same as a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

788
00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:45.340
<v Speaker 7>Like if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I said to a friend of mine,</v>

789
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 7>how gay are you on a percentage scale?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Zero to a hundred and if a guy says,</v>

790
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.610
<v Speaker 7>if a guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

791
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.520
<v Speaker 7>a hundred,</v>

792
00:33:51.521 --> 00:33:52.870
<v Speaker 7>he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then if a guy says,</v>

793
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.860
<v Speaker 7>second guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

795
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.960
<v Speaker 7>48 I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

796
00:33:55.961 --> 00:33:56.860
<v Speaker 7>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

797
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.240
<v Speaker 7>that's tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

798
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jeff,</v>

799
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.270
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then if a guy says zero,</v>

800
00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:03.130
<v Speaker 7>I'm zero.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck that.</v>

801
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.370
<v Speaker 7>It's the same as the hundred guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Extremism is the same.</v>

802
00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:08.080
<v Speaker 7>It's just a different,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just a different angle.</v>

803
00:34:08.081 --> 00:34:10.510
<v Speaker 7>But there's not enough people that are</v>
<v Speaker 7>40% gay.</v>

804
00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.220
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of people in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 7>it all.</v>

805
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:14.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of people try to say we are</v>

806
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.890
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually really am in defendant and</v>

807
00:34:16.891 --> 00:34:19.110
<v Speaker 6>it's like I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then you talk to them a little bit</v>

808
00:34:19.111 --> 00:34:22.650
<v Speaker 6>and they're there on one side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very difficult because there's no</v>

809
00:34:22.651 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 6>truth anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no paper.</v>

810
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.450
<v Speaker 6>There's no one day used to be like if</v>
<v Speaker 6>you watched,</v>

811
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>CBS,</v>

812
00:34:28.801 --> 00:34:30.030
<v Speaker 6>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ABC News,</v>

813
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.530
<v Speaker 6>there was a journalistic integrity that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they subscribe to and both sides said,</v>

814
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 6>these are the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

815
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:41.100
<v Speaker 6>There's no news outlet any longer that</v>
<v Speaker 6>both sides look at.</v>

816
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.000
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a really important point.</v>

817
00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.210
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's very like very clear.</v>

818
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:48.190
<v Speaker 7>It's cut and dry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How did that happen?</v>

819
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.331
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want.</v>

820
00:34:49.331 --> 00:34:53.110
<v Speaker 7>I'm curious to know when and how,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what at what time period of</v>

821
00:34:53.111 --> 00:34:56.860
<v Speaker 7>politics at that become the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the shift of like an obvious,</v>

822
00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.010
<v Speaker 7>this is precisely who were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who were four and it's clear.</v>

823
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I was watching CNN and Fox News back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth like after the debate and it was</v>

824
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 2>so fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

825
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.940
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is telling the truth?</v>

826
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has happening here?</v>

827
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Because these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's two totally different stories and</v>

828
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:16.094
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so,</v>

829
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>they're so clear on one side or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

830
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Like Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

831
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:26.661
<v Speaker 2>It was so clear on trump's side and CNN</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so clear on Hillary's side.</v>

832
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.880
<v Speaker 2>It was so odd places in one day</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Fox News.</v>

833
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 2>They just switched places overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

834
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Well it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be One of your network and</v>

835
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 2>the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

836
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.670
<v Speaker 2>what a news do you follow Jeff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow it all.</v>

837
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't follow any news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch and read a lot of news.</v>

838
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I always have like a aggregator on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone that pulls from different news</v>

839
00:35:53.181 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 2>sources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to</v>

840
00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:00.210
<v Speaker 2>search up topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious what Chris Christie is up to</v>

841
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 2>this week or Al Franken or just get</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone on my mind.</v>

842
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I go to politico and usually</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great angle that you hadn't</v>

843
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:10.260
<v Speaker 2>thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politico and guardian are good for</v>

844
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 2>different angles.</v>

<v Speaker 2>rising up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>going after him.</v>

867

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like the CIA and the</v>

868
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 2>intelligence agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're making some sort of a</v>

869
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 2>concerted effort to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to single him out and go after him and</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the urine,</v>

<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

876
00:37:20.841 --> 00:37:22.040
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

878
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't give a fuck about politics.</v>

879
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.310
<v Speaker 2>crosses them the way trump already has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to set a barium.</v>

880
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

881
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

882
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 2>has there ever been a time where an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsubstantiated story about a guy who's</v>

883
00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>the president elect about peeing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>beds?</v>

884
00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.150
<v Speaker 2>They talked about that like so openly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

885
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been so open.</v>

886
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 2>That is last press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shut down the rumor by saying he's a</v>

887
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Germaphobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how massive of a story that is.</v>

888
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 2>That during one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>press conferences,</v>

889
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 2>he addressed that fucking thing and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't stop there.</v>

890
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Then he went on to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

891
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows this camera is in the</v>

892
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

893
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I stupid?</v>

894
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.030
<v Speaker 2>What am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am morally was the weight of I stupid.</v>

895
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And then you watched how he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever seen,</v>

897
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might be me being ignorant,</v>

898
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:24.360
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if I've ever seen a</v>
<v Speaker 2>president in a press conference or</v>

899
00:38:24.361 --> 00:38:28.290
<v Speaker 2>president elect shut down a source like</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

900
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 2>CNN was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't talk to you.</v>

901
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've ever seen a</v>

902
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>president single one out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they probably slyly ignore</v>

903
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 5>certain journalists that they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to fucking talk to.</v>

904
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 5>But I've never seen one to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't talk to see it.</v>

905
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't talk to that new source.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

906
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that there is a protocol for who</v>

907
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:45.850
<v Speaker 5>you go to first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for years,</v>

908
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 5>the first question always went to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>one old woman from the Associated Press.</v>

909
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.633
<v Speaker 5>From the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

910
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.950
<v Speaker 5>she was always the first question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

911
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then after that,</v>

912
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 5>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a certain pecking order to it.</v>

913
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and trump just basically said,</v>

914
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

915
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to choose what news and</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions you guys here from now on is</v>

916
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:10.300
<v Speaker 5>not that the press corps is no longer</v>
<v Speaker 5>traveling with him.</v>

917
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 5>It's the first time a president has not</v>
<v Speaker 5>had the press corps with him at all</v>

918
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

919
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause and as well,</v>

920
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 5>and his reasoning was he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you gonna Watch me eat food?</v>

921
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.680
<v Speaker 5>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he thought that they were</v>

922
00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:20.970
<v Speaker 5>at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

923
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

924
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're interested in what's going on.</v>

925
00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:25.680
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're interested in what this,</v>

926
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 5>this conversation you might be having</v>
<v Speaker 5>with someone have some sense of</v>

927
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 5>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was like,</v>

928
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you watching me do simple</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

929
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 5>but that's just part of their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gig.</v>

930
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they've always done.</v>

931
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.470
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I think about that like how</v>

932
00:39:38.471 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 5>much simple shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they seen where it's so annoying,</v>

933
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've got to be like,</v>

934
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is so boring.</v>

935
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Especially when they get on Air Force</v>
<v Speaker 5>One and they're going to fucking Russia</v>

936
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:49.610
<v Speaker 5>for 10 hours to sit around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they can do like a,</v>

937
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:52.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a 32nd photo op and yell questions</v>

938
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:55.750
<v Speaker 5>at him and then another 10 hour flight</v>
<v Speaker 5>home and imagine like some,</v>

939
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:57.100
<v Speaker 5>one of the guys in the group is just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

940
00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:58.840
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to go talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other guy was like,</v>

941
00:39:58.841 --> 00:39:59.674
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

942
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.730
<v Speaker 7>he'll go in his room,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

943
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.340
<v Speaker 7>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think we're cool now man.</v>

944
00:40:04.341 --> 00:40:05.630
<v Speaker 7>We've had some moments,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

945
00:40:05.631 --> 00:40:07.910
<v Speaker 7>I feel like we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't be that guy.</v>

946
00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.730
<v Speaker 7>And then the rest of the nine hour plane</v>
<v Speaker 7>flight is fucking miserable.</v>

947
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.330
<v Speaker 7>He was praising Kanye West for</v>
<v Speaker 7>supporting him.</v>

948
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.990
<v Speaker 7>I remember watching it on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is this real life?</v>

949
00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.853
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a trip.</v>

950
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:20.990
<v Speaker 7>Is this real lightweight?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read the greatest.</v>

951
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.870
<v Speaker 7>I wish I know the source just because I</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't want to fucking say somebody</v>

952
00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:25.730
<v Speaker 7>else's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there was just a meme floating</v>

953
00:40:25.731 --> 00:40:29.780
<v Speaker 7>around in the Internet that said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bet you they,</v>

954
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.780
<v Speaker 7>years ago when Obama gained presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there were so many fucking extremist</v>

955
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:36.950
<v Speaker 7>going.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bet you the first people that are,</v>

956
00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:39.500
<v Speaker 7>he's going to talk to our rappers and</v>
<v Speaker 7>Steve Harvey</v>

957
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.130
<v Speaker 7>and then you see fucking zoo trough just</v>
<v Speaker 7>drags in rappers.</v>

958
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.410
<v Speaker 7>And I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was,</v>

959
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:49.760
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's so fucking true.</v>

960
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.100
<v Speaker 7>How many white extremists were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck this.</v>

961
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.530
<v Speaker 7>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's going to talk to rappers in the</v>

962
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 7>White House and it's trump that's doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

963
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.930
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's great.</v>

964
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so funny.</v>

965
00:40:58.241 --> 00:41:01.250
<v Speaker 7>What is he talking to?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like who else is he like publicly?</v>

966
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

967
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.360
<v Speaker 7>Don King.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don King.</v>

968
00:41:05.361 --> 00:41:06.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He loves Don King,</v>

969
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.390
<v Speaker 7>but they've had a relationship in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>past,</v>

970
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.010
<v Speaker 7>so like they've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they go back.</v>

971
00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:14.420
<v Speaker 7>So this is almost like he gets to invite</v>
<v Speaker 7>his actual friends to remember when</v>

972
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.840
<v Speaker 7>Obama in trouble or getting</v>
<v Speaker 7>ambassadorships.</v>

973
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:18.900
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

974
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.320
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not Christie,</v>

975
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.220
<v Speaker 7>Christie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nothing.</v>

976
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.390
<v Speaker 7>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't need,</v>

977
00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.970
<v Speaker 7>I don't mean his political friends.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean his friends,</v>

978
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 7>his life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>France and his book buddies that he</v>

979
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:31.244
<v Speaker 7>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

980
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.640
<v Speaker 7>it was this man with a little bottle</v>
<v Speaker 7>attached,</v>

981
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 7>that really</v>

982
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 2>radical professor who was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weathermen.</v>

983
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they call themselves.</v>

984
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.520
<v Speaker 2>And they were like doing acid and having</v>
<v Speaker 2>orgies and shit and robbing banks or</v>

985
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:46.010
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like a part of that and some</v>

986
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a professor that Obama knew</v>

987
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 2>in college and it was always this big</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy that he knew this radical</v>

988
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 2>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

989
00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Obama is like some fucking sleeper guy.</v>

990
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.580
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he did have to distance himself from</v>

991
00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:03.100
<v Speaker 5>the guy because he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy did have some very,</v>

992
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.660
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pro,</v>

993
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>succession,</v>

994
00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.370
<v Speaker 5>what do you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the blacks to think you should return to</v>

995
00:42:09.371 --> 00:42:13.120
<v Speaker 5>Africa and which you pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of those guys.</v>

996
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.280
<v Speaker 5>Secessionist sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

997
00:42:15.281 --> 00:42:17.380
<v Speaker 5>I guess succession,</v>
<v Speaker 5>succession.</v>

998
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.950
<v Speaker 5>Succession is a session.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A session session session.</v>

999
00:42:20.951 --> 00:42:21.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to see it.</v>

1000
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.830
<v Speaker 5>So we know he had to back off from that</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>

1001
00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1002
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about the guy who,</v>

1003
00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you guys seen his brother?</v>

1004
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.230
<v Speaker 5>Do you know about his brother on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>playground?</v>

1005
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.950
<v Speaker 5>Groundwater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama's brother.</v>

1006
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Do you know this account?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard about this?</v>

1007
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.340
<v Speaker 5>There was like a guy who's saying he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>his brother and psych.</v>

1008
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.371
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1009
00:42:39.371 --> 00:42:40.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't support him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I support trump.</v>

1010
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.710
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you haven't,</v>

1011
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.470
<v Speaker 5>you haven't seen it pretending to be as</v>
<v Speaker 5>brief as you saw this.</v>

1012
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is his half brothers,</v>

1013
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.873
<v Speaker 5>half brothers</v>

1014
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 2>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably is.</v>

1015
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about fake news.</v>

1016
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was fake.</v>

1017
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.460
<v Speaker 2>But trump's,</v>

1018
00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.710
<v Speaker 6>but trump was fucking job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trump is talking to this dude like</v>

1019
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.600
<v Speaker 6>thanks for the support.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thanks for not supporting your half</v>

1020
00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:05.340
<v Speaker 6>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Talk about fake news.</v>

1021
00:43:05.341 --> 00:43:10.080
<v Speaker 6>How about trump ran around for three</v>
<v Speaker 6>years saying that fucking Obama wasn't</v>

1022
00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:12.480
<v Speaker 6>born in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>

1023
00:43:12.481 --> 00:43:13.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean that was the beginning of</v>

1024
00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.460
<v Speaker 5>news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me see his ID.</v>

1025
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Let me see his birth certificate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then how would the irony,</v>

1026
00:43:18.881 --> 00:43:23.290
<v Speaker 5>now trump won't show his fucking taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He won't.</v>

1027
00:43:23.291 --> 00:43:26.410
<v Speaker 5>And because he's his excuses even after</v>
<v Speaker 5>the audits over,</v>

1028
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.130
<v Speaker 5>what do people need to see now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>

1029
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.710
<v Speaker 5>that's the reasoning is like what do you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to see if the,</v>

1030
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.440
<v Speaker 5>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I get audited and I'd fucking deal</v>

1031
00:43:35.441 --> 00:43:37.780
<v Speaker 5>with the government through the audit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you need to know other than</v>

1032
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.110
<v Speaker 5>we're taking care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people want to know how much</v>

1033
00:43:41.111 --> 00:43:43.600
<v Speaker 5>money he has borrowed from China and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia.</v>

1034
00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that could really affect is a,</v>

1035
00:43:46.181 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>policy.</v>

1036
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.363
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1037
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I thought that that was like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you had to divulge your</v>

1038
00:43:52.331 --> 00:43:53.440
<v Speaker 2>income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

1039
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:57.130
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a deal with Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why Howard didn't eventually like</v>

1040
00:43:57.131 --> 00:44:00.190
<v Speaker 2>really run for governor after a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>point because they wanted him to divulge</v>

1041
00:44:00.191 --> 00:44:02.380
<v Speaker 2>his taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they found out who hasn't</v>

1042
00:44:02.381 --> 00:44:04.690
<v Speaker 2>paid his taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't pay taxes because of his</v>

1043
00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:07.780
<v Speaker 2>major loss a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1044
00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:09.760
<v Speaker 2>that was that weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic city law,</v>

1045
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 2>he had to make some disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does it.</v>

1046
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a general summary of his income.</v>

1047
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It would also say Mary has money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain types of ways,</v>

1048
00:44:19.841 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as income taxes where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what he spent on phone calls and</v>

1049
00:44:23.381 --> 00:44:26.220
<v Speaker 2>security and everything and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>invest rico,</v>

1050
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.810
<v Speaker 2>he would also tell you how much he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>donated to charity,</v>

1051
00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:29.620
<v Speaker 2>which he doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

1052
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.170
<v Speaker 5>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1053
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 5>he created his own</v>

1054
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>charitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1055
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>

1056
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1057
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Charitable charitable funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charitable,</v>

1058
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 2>charitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a charity and a,</v>

1059
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>and apparently he hasn't given any money</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1060
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:45.360
<v Speaker 2>And like two or three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just been money he solicited from</v>

1061
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 2>people on the outside to give to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>charity that then he disperses so crazy.</v>

1062
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 2>But that's the whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then do we know that that's real too?</v>

1063
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1064
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1065
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1066
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I would like to think that's gotta be</v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

1067
00:44:58.141 --> 00:44:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1068
00:44:59.011 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Because they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can solicit the records of his</v>

1069
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.770
<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nonprofit.</v>

1070
00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.361
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1071
00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1072
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.410
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they can't do it for his personal</v>

1073
00:45:06.411 --> 00:45:10.770
<v Speaker 2>and private</v>
<v Speaker 2>game president for 20 years.</v>

1074
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.830
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to change it.</v>

1075
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.870
<v Speaker 2>He's going to step aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us buddy take over like Putin did in</v>

1076
00:45:16.871 --> 00:45:17.704
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

1077
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Eventually one of his kids or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1078
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:21.990
<v Speaker 2>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Came over.</v>

1079
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Get on board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Game over.</v>

1080
00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.220
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1081
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Chris rock was seeing them on stage or</v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

1082
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit wrapped around that.</v>

1083
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 2>It was very funny and I was top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1084
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all laughing,</v>

1085
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 2>but if something like that did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't trump,</v>

1086
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 2>it was somebody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the next guy to figure out</v>

1087
00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 2>how to do it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1088
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we essentially exposed the personality</v>

1089
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 2>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You expose the flaw in it.</v>

1090
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 2>You're not looking for the best leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You looking for the person who's got the</v>

1091
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:55.960
<v Speaker 2>best personality for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person who's got the best story.</v>

1092
00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Why you fucking one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams,</v>

1093
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>the guy wrote Dilbert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a really,</v>

1094
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:06.330
<v Speaker 2>really smart guy and he predicted trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>winning a long time ago and the reason</v>

1095
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 2>why predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he's the most persuasive guy</v>

1096
00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:09.444
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>

1097
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.110
<v Speaker 2>So He's incredibly persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just understands the art of</v>

1098
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 2>persuasion extremely well and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just if you looked at it like</v>

1099
00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 2>mathematically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this guy is a really good chance</v>

1100
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 2>and he predicted he was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>president and people gave him so much</v>

1101
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 2>shit and he doesn't even vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a really interesting guy.</v>

1102
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy.</v>

1103
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.000
<v Speaker 2>And he wasn't saying that trump is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be president because he's this big</v>

1104
00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:33.300
<v Speaker 2>trump supporter and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that he just,</v>

1105
00:46:33.301 --> 00:46:35.940
<v Speaker 2>he was looking at it like pragmatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1106
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 2>this guy has incredible abilities of</v>
<v Speaker 2>persuasion.</v>

1107
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's broken every single rule,</v>

1108
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.530
<v Speaker 2>every conventional wisdom about running</v>
<v Speaker 2>for president,</v>

1109
00:46:46.531 --> 00:46:48.610
<v Speaker 2>he broke and one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now it's like,</v>

1110
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff,</v>

1111
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:51.150
<v Speaker 2>who fucking knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1112
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing normal anymore.</v>

1113
00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he gets two terms easy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then after that he's just going to line</v>

1114
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 2>up people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no more term or terms no more.</v>

1115
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.090
<v Speaker 2>She said No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's just,</v>

1116
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.120
<v Speaker 2>there's no more voting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think so.</v>

1117
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's gonna get interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1118
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he locks up his own military</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to start.</v>

1119
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 2>He's already marginalized the press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's told he's got,</v>

1120
00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:21.570
<v Speaker 2>he told his followers that the press is</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying,</v>

1121
00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 2>arresting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not impeaching stand in the White</v>

1122
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.840
<v Speaker 2>House for like two nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not even moving the fucking,</v>

1123
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to,</v>

1124
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>he's going</v>

1125
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.780
<v Speaker 5>to stay in these satellite White House</v>
<v Speaker 5>in New York City.</v>

1126
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 5>He wants a satellite in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should have seen the way way operates.</v>

1127
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 5>There's no way he's going to the White</v>
<v Speaker 5>House and having all that around them.</v>

1128
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 5>You know what's so funny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for a little while for them to</v>

1129
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:47.430
<v Speaker 5>make it look good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I am fucking freaking out right now.</v>

1130
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Pitch people in New York or Paul Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you get out the trafficker and</v>

1131
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.170
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might like it there and stay.</v>

1132
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:54.250
<v Speaker 5>I could see him all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1133
00:47:54.251 --> 00:47:57.760
<v Speaker 5>it was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He likes it when he can rub elbows with</v>

1134
00:47:57.761 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 5>famous people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's so funny about this</v>

1135
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 5>inauguration weekend for him is that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't get any celebrities and that's</v>

1136
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 5>all he really cares about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the most important thing.</v>

1137
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.700
<v Speaker 5>And then he got that one young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they offered it to that one young</v>

1138
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:10.511
<v Speaker 5>singer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the chick,</v>

1139
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 5>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1140
00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.950
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it if I can sing.</v>

1141
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1142
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.100
<v Speaker 5>what is that fucking song?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1143
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 5>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's about slavery in American,</v>

1144
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 5>about black people swinging from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>trees.</v>

1145
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.190
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet home,</v>

1146

1147
00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 5>That's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1148
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.080
<v Speaker 5>But she basically was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

1149
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:36.220
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it if you let me sing this song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course they were like,</v>

1150

<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely not.</v>

1151
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:38.640

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great for talking to [inaudible].</v>

1280
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.700
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's funny.</v>

1281
00:54:30.701 --> 00:54:33.430
<v Speaker 5>They got me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He should like make like he was just</v>

1282
00:54:33.431 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 5>being tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1283
00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing about this country is we love</v>

1284
00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:38.800
<v Speaker 5>it when we hate somebody and then we</v>
<v Speaker 5>liked him again.</v>

1285
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:39.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1286
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:43.660
<v Speaker 5>so all he has to do is that all he has</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do is put out some positive tweets</v>

1287
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:48.610
<v Speaker 5>and be conciliatory and then watched the</v>
<v Speaker 5>country just sweeping them up in there.</v>

1288
00:54:48.611 --> 00:54:50.890
<v Speaker 5>I look at what happened at Bush after</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine 11 yeah,</v>

1289
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.730
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had the lowest favorable favorability</v>

1290
00:54:54.731 --> 00:54:59.350
<v Speaker 5>rating of any president in history and</v>
<v Speaker 5>after nine 11 he shot up to like 80%</v>

1291
00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:00.820
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>

1292
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

1293
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:02.890
<v Speaker 5>they said trump has the lowest</v>

1294
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:07.050
<v Speaker 2>incoming president elect a approval</v>
<v Speaker 2>rating in the history.</v>

1295
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 2>How do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they compile that?</v>

1296
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered.</v>

1297
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they compete?</v>

1298
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are they asking exactly?</v>

1299
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's taking polls.</v>

1300
00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 2>People would take polls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>

1301
00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:19.411
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1302
00:55:19.411 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 2>that's like the funniest people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>projected the election to go to a</v>

1303
00:55:22.561 --> 00:55:23.131
<v Speaker 2>hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1304
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:24.860
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is they trust him</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1305
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 2>They will know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were right.</v>

1306
00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:27.630
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was a popular vote,</v>

1307
00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.310
<v Speaker 2>like they actually were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1308
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was real.</v>

1309
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:31.470
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

1310
00:55:31.471 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 2>it just shows how crazy electoral</v>
<v Speaker 2>college system is,</v>

1311
00:55:33.691 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1312
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 2>it should be a popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1313
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 2>that's a different race though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he like conceded that it's better</v>

1314
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.780
<v Speaker 2>to have it be the popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1315
00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:44.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1316
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.540
<v Speaker 2>He says that's not the game he goes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game is the electoral college vote</v>

1317
00:55:48.541 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the game we played and we won by</v>

1318
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 2>a landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1319
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played it like a game.</v>

1320
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.480
<v Speaker 2>They played it like this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing over and over and</v>

1321
00:55:57.481 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up in that they,</v>

1322
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.540
<v Speaker 2>they rigged it for so long that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their popularity contest got taken over</v>

1323
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:10.950
<v Speaker 2>by someone who's actually popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an actual famous person and knows</v>

1324
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:14.130
<v Speaker 2>how to become like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to become more popular.</v>

1325
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he understands the,</v>

1326
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:18.300
<v Speaker 2>some people know the formula of how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1327
00:56:18.301 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to fucking do it and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich as fuck and he doesn't have to do</v>

1328
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>what they want him to do.</v>

1329
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.420
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's different.</v>

1330
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:29.560
<v Speaker 5>She can finance his own campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets there,</v>

1331
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:34.070
<v Speaker 5>he gets pressed by talking mad shit and</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting people to talk about him like</v>

1332
00:56:34.071 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 5>she knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1333
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.550
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing that I'm confused about</v>
<v Speaker 5>is what's the overall vision?</v>

1334
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:43.960
<v Speaker 5>Like what is trump ism like if you think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about democratic,</v>

1335
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.120
<v Speaker 7>what's trump craddick it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 7>question.</v>

1336
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:50.630
<v Speaker 7>Small government.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1337
00:56:50.631 --> 00:56:51.930
<v Speaker 7>I mean I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think the tea,</v>

1338
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 7>I mean his truths are to to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 7>taxes are low for people that are</v>

1339
00:56:57.321 --> 00:57:01.850
<v Speaker 7>earning a lot so he can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those people can stabilize that market</v>

1340
00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.230
<v Speaker 7>that they're already in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

1341
00:57:03.231 --> 00:57:05.090
<v Speaker 7>That people don't have to sacrifice at</v>
<v Speaker 7>the top.</v>

1342
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.200
<v Speaker 7>I think he's pretty clear about that and</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's little.</v>

1343
00:57:07.201 --> 00:57:08.930
<v Speaker 7>He lowered,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he wants to lower the fuck out of</v>

1344
00:57:08.931 --> 00:57:11.000
<v Speaker 7>business tax.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wants that to go see the low.</v>

1345
00:57:11.001 --> 00:57:14.990
<v Speaker 7>So He's saying zero government let these</v>
<v Speaker 7>people fucking govern themselves.</v>

1346
00:57:14.991 --> 00:57:18.050
<v Speaker 7>Let small businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's his whole campaign is to keep</v>

1347
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.050
<v Speaker 7>money up top where it is the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>let,</v>

1348
00:57:21.051 --> 00:57:21.410
<v Speaker 7>let,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let,</v>

1349
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:23.300
<v Speaker 7>let pockets that are pretty fixed day</v>
<v Speaker 7>thick.</v>

1350
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.490
<v Speaker 7>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he's pretty transparent about</v>

1351
00:57:25.491 --> 00:57:27.080
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That seems to be a thing that he's</v>

1352
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:31.130
<v Speaker 7>pretty obvious about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he wants the rich stay rich and</v>

1353
00:57:31.131 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 7>he's not afraid of saying it and for</v>
<v Speaker 7>some reason people that are poor,</v>

1354
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 7>like I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.890
<v Speaker 7>I like what he's going for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1356
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.200
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy.</v>

1357
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be very,</v>

1358
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 5>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really curious to see how this plays</v>

1359
00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:47.010
<v Speaker 5>a Hubbell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1360
00:57:47.011 --> 00:57:49.560
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1361
00:57:49.561 --> 00:57:51.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like any other time when I'm not</v>

1362
00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:54.800
<v Speaker 5>happy about what's going on politically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just put my head in the sand for a</v>

1363
00:57:54.801 --> 00:57:57.450
<v Speaker 5>while and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just check in and a few months,</v>

1364
00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:01.770
<v Speaker 5>but I cannot stop reading on my phone in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the papers.</v>

1365
00:58:01.771 --> 00:58:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Like this is like we're living through a</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of history that's probably more</v>

1366
00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:09.390
<v Speaker 5>turbulent than any other historic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any other presidential transition.</v>

1367
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.090
<v Speaker 5>Do you think this is for Johnson and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy?</v>

1368
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.450
<v Speaker 7>This is like a big metaphorical</v>
<v Speaker 7>question,</v>

1369
00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:16.820
<v Speaker 7>but because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like Obama lived through the age of like</v>

1370
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.640
<v Speaker 7>the bursting of the Internet space and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1371
00:58:19.641 --> 00:58:22.940
<v Speaker 7>and its involvement in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know of like twitter and instagram</v>

1372
00:58:22.941 --> 00:58:23.580
<v Speaker 7>and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shit,</v>

1373
00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.060
<v Speaker 5>this was bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is even bigger than that.</v>

1374
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:31.070
<v Speaker 5>It gives midlife breakdown right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is it bottoming out halfway.</v>

1375
00:58:31.501 --> 00:58:34.400
<v Speaker 5>This is the halfway point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got another two I think.</v>

1376
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think trump is president for 20 years</v>

1377
00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:40.590
<v Speaker 5>or three days or it's like something</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible.</v>

1378
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:41.750
<v Speaker 5>But do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do you think,</v>

1379
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.640
<v Speaker 5>worry about something terrible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry to interrupt you because,</v>

1380
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:49.670
<v Speaker 5>because I think he had a real control</v>
<v Speaker 5>over his message in America.</v>

1381
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has friends who own the tabloids,</v>

1382
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.410
<v Speaker 5>remember Asanas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember flying with them.</v>

1383
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.670
<v Speaker 5>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like,</v>

1384
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.190
<v Speaker 5>no fuck you go back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't see mind.</v>

1385
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.330
<v Speaker 5>My best friend's own tabloids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1386
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:07.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1387
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.660
<v Speaker 5>and those are his boys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the [inaudible] family.</v>

1388
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:15.600
<v Speaker 5>They had all the bad stories locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now when it starts happening in</v>

1389
00:59:15.601 --> 00:59:18.480
<v Speaker 5>Russia and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't have quite the old on it.</v>

1390
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 5>People can really get to and</v>

1391
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.970
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
00:59:22.971 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 4>he's not young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1393
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 4>I worry about something bad happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It may not end well for him.</v>

1394
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:28.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really a tricky one.</v>

1395
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 4>The mother part of me says get fine</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're going to be around for</v>

1396
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:32.564
<v Speaker 4>the rest of my life.</v>

1397
00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:36.870
<v Speaker 3>The Glenn Greenwald thing is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting angle though cause Glenn</v>

1398
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Greenwald is a really respected</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist.</v>

1399
00:59:39.121 --> 00:59:43.920
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who exposed wiki leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy who a lot of people go to and</v>

1400
00:59:43.921 --> 00:59:47.430
<v Speaker 3>he's not without his criticisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of people criticize.</v>

1401
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.273
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1402
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:51.000
<v Speaker 3>he's had this ongoing feud is Sam</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris.</v>

1403
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

1404
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you look at like what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's talking about here,</v>

1405
00:59:56.190 --> 01:00:01.190
<v Speaker 3>if there's any shred of truth to it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing like this old institution</v>

1406
01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:06.180
<v Speaker 3>attack this new coming incoming guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it in a foolish way that actually</v>

1407
01:00:06.181 --> 01:00:10.320
<v Speaker 3>kind of strengthens this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this disbelief that people have in the</v>

1408
01:00:10.321 --> 01:00:12.600
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they make up some crazy story</v>

1409
01:00:12.601 --> 01:00:15.810
<v Speaker 3>and you hear CNN talking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other people talking about it</v>

1410
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:20.070
<v Speaker 3>and substantiated reports that involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>lewd activities and golden showers,</v>

1411
01:00:20.071 --> 01:00:23.720
<v Speaker 3>like who the fuck is doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who's doing this?</v>

1412
01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because by doing this,</v>

1413
01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:30.660
<v Speaker 3>especially when it looks obvious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb like that did it makes his case</v>

1414
01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:33.000
<v Speaker 3>look stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like something that he would</v>

1415
01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:37.680
<v Speaker 3>do to attack himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like how nero burned Rome,</v>

1416
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:38.750
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you,</v>

1417
01:00:38.751 --> 01:00:41.640
<v Speaker 3>you might do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attack yourself so that you'll look</v>

1418
01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:42.474
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable.</v>

1419
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1420
01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.320
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1421
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he's a great ad is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>counterpoint.</v>

1422
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I've been living in New York City during</v>
<v Speaker 4>his entire reign of popularity.</v>

1423
01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:54.300
<v Speaker 4>He's a great counter puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if something happens,</v>

1424
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.850
<v Speaker 4>even if you perceive it as bad for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows how to work that.</v>

1425
01:00:57.851 --> 01:01:02.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what he talked about with Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 4>west and I talking about Kanye do that</v>

1426
01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:05.430
<v Speaker 4>every time a really a friend would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh boy,</v>

1427
01:01:05.431 --> 01:01:07.980
<v Speaker 4>this is going to really going to sink</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I go watch.</v>

1428
01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't run a country like that.</v>

1429
01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:12.510
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can win an office but you can't.</v>

1430
01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows what he's going to do.</v>

1431
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:18.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm just super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't probably,</v>

1432
01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:19.770
<v Speaker 4>he probably knows but we don't know</v>

1433
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.490
<v Speaker 3>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1434
01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.620
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're right about saying that he's</v>

1435
01:01:23.621 --> 01:01:25.960
<v Speaker 3>never going to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then obviously that's going to become a</v>

1436
01:01:25.961 --> 01:01:29.140
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're not right about it and he</v>

1437
01:01:29.141 --> 01:01:34.141
<v Speaker 3>does manage to show some flaws in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and expose them,</v>

1438
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.160
<v Speaker 4>then it could be be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1439
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe no one else is going to do it</v>

1440
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.160
<v Speaker 3>other than Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Bernie won and obviously they were</v>

1441
01:01:41.161 --> 01:01:43.800
<v Speaker 3>conspiring to t Bernie out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if Bernie won,</v>

1442
01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:47.880
<v Speaker 3>we could have seen some really weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes in the system and and overall</v>

1443
01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:48.990
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

1444
01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:51.120
<v Speaker 3>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be a mood shifter.</v>

1445
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Like Bernie would be a guy that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of what a lot of people</v>

1446
01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:58.140
<v Speaker 3>looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who is not money oriented.</v>

1447
01:01:58.141 --> 01:02:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Someone who is like for the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who lives a fairly simple life</v>

1448
01:02:01.531 --> 01:02:02.364
<v Speaker 3>for a guy like that</v>

1449
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 4>pope when the pope got in you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh he cares about the,</v>

1450
01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 4>it was like the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They became friends,</v>

1451
01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>

1452
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the pope got rid of that throne.</v>

1453
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:14.650
<v Speaker 3>He went with a more casual dress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1454
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.770
<v Speaker 3>It's in a lot of ways like what Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have represented I think is</v>

1455
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>someone who's</v>

1456
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.040
<v Speaker 4>not of the same cloth as we're used to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want someone who was like concerned</v>

1457
01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 4>about equality across the up above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 4>And like broke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1459
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's say you're right.</v>

1460
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:34.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just and this and then so fed of the guy</v>

1461
01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 4>should are there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman who should or could have,</v>

1462
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fighting of the wrong game all</v>

1463
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:40.260
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1464
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was probably a great smart person</v>

1465
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:44.190
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1466
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 4>you drift into distractions and she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to,</v>

1467
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.690
<v Speaker 4>well this is also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something weird happens like the why and</v>

1468
01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 4>wiring goes haywire and the guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most popular at something completely</v>

1469
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 4>different gets in there on a freak of</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

1470
01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean this country has gone through in</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years,</v>

1471
01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 4>you cannot set amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely amusing.</v>

1472
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.640
<v Speaker 4>There's a little part of glee in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>heart where it goes,</v>

1473
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 4>what the supreme court was.</v>

1474
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like seeing the whole thing fell as</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians.</v>

1475
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:16.531
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1476
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I live long and we all have everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of talk about for the next four</v>

1477
01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made everyone's life a lot more</v>

1478
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:24.630
<v Speaker 4>interesting all of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think that there's a</v>

1479
01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:27.450
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of intimidation about</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing him?</v>

1480
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>

1481
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.190
<v Speaker 4>there's some real intimidation that</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes from,</v>

1482
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.680
<v Speaker 4>he's a legitimate powerful man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to be on his enemies?</v>

1483
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be horrible.</v>

1484
01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.970
<v Speaker 4>And everybody said it feels like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with great power comes great</v>

1485
01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:43.920
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the things that people</v>

1486
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 4>were really terrified of with a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because he's got so much power and</v>

1487
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 4>so much influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't used to,</v>

1488
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:52.470
<v Speaker 4>he was a joke in a weird way to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1489
01:03:52.471 --> 01:03:55.920
<v Speaker 4>but I always knew that he could actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>do things like when you see him in New</v>

1490
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.401
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

1491
01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:58.080
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

1492
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a tower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was not there.</v>

1493
01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.360
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think he's willy nilly like</v>

1494
01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 4>shooting from the hip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's patient built buildings.</v>

1495
01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:09.630
<v Speaker 4>That's different.</v>

1496
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:10.980
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I grew up in New York,</v>

1497
01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:12.150
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1498
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:14.790
<v Speaker 5>w when he was a celebrity in New York</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not the country.</v>

1499
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.410
<v Speaker 5>He was just a slum Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1500
01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 5>that's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked about it and my family,</v>

1501
01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they was just a guy who was a guy who</v>

1502
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 5>had suits against him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He owned,</v>

1503
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.650
<v Speaker 5>he owned projects when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was pretty well known back then</v>

1504
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 5>that he was a slum Lord.</v>

1505
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter is a hobby for him.</v>

1506
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:33.560
<v Speaker 4>I think building is his occupation and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really hard thing to do.</v>

1507
01:04:33.561 --> 01:04:34.780
<v Speaker 4>I remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1508
01:04:34.781 --> 01:04:38.540
<v Speaker 4>the skating rink popping up and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>always talking about taking over a</v>

1509
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:42.260
<v Speaker 4>squashed of land in New York when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were lucky to get a little apartment</v>

1510
01:04:42.261 --> 01:04:43.820
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy who's going to buy like the</v>

1511
01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:45.650
<v Speaker 4>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the trains where there's some ways</v>

1512
01:04:45.651 --> 01:04:48.860
<v Speaker 4>you have to be like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are to all of that.</v>

1513
01:04:48.861 --> 01:04:51.380
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even if he didn't and his politics</v>

1514
01:04:51.381 --> 01:04:54.470
<v Speaker 4>didn't emerge until much later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just kind of kept the cool and</v>

1515
01:04:54.471 --> 01:04:59.471
<v Speaker 4>it was just like a playboy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a personality and you know,</v>

1516
01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:04.760
<v Speaker 4>it was like a kick to see him around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He always loved a good joke,</v>

1517
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was generous so I get it a lot</v>

1518
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.560
<v Speaker 4>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them not surprised some of the</v>

1519
01:05:12.561 --> 01:05:15.800
<v Speaker 4>smartest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most successful people I know in New</v>

1520
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 4>York supported them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think though that at the level of</v>

1521
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:23.650
<v Speaker 4>responsibility that you have when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>become the president and the amount of</v>

1522
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 4>power that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that anybody can really</v>

1523
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:29.670
<v Speaker 4>manage that correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1524
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:31.600
<v Speaker 4>let's fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your take on this position?</v>

1525
01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things is it's exposing this,</v>

1526
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:39.010
<v Speaker 4>this is exposing how ridiculous the</v>
<v Speaker 4>position is that you could get someone</v>

1527
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 4>who's just this one popular person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets into place and run this entire</v>

1528
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what one person running anything.</v>

1529
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:46.850
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1530
01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:49.820
<v Speaker 5>Well are we overstating the president?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really runs,</v>

1531
01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:51.170
<v Speaker 5>look what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1532
01:05:51.171 --> 01:05:54.260
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying once you're in office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think president has as much</v>

1533
01:05:54.261 --> 01:05:54.750
<v Speaker 5>power?</v>

1534
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.480
<v Speaker 4>People were going to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to find out what kind of</v>

1535
01:05:57.481 --> 01:05:59.190
<v Speaker 4>power he has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause look who look what he's doing.</v>

1536
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.630
<v Speaker 4>What could we be talking about with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>press corps?</v>

1537
01:06:00.631 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 4>Look where you're talking about with get</v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's accumulating leverage and power.</v>

1540
01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:09.830
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by putting people around him</v>

1541
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.130
<v Speaker 4>operate without his family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's always going to have his family</v>

1542
01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:17.010
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't just suddenly Tello</v>

1543
01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:21.930
<v Speaker 4>indycar driver tomorrow you're driving a</v>
<v Speaker 4>nascar like he's been doing it a certain</v>

1544
01:06:21.931 --> 01:06:22.760
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1545
01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But his,</v>

<v Speaker 5>they can't advise them on policy because</v>

1548
01:06:30.501 --> 01:06:32.570
<v Speaker 5>they're running is a companies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to,</v>

1549
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.980
<v Speaker 5>they have to never have a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 5>with him again about the businesses or</v>

1550
01:06:36.981 --> 01:06:39.230
<v Speaker 5>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on like,</v>

1551
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:41.330
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds so ridiculous.</v>

1552
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.400
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's just no fucking way,</v>

1553
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.430
<v Speaker 4>but even if they still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if that's how it is,</v>

1554
01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:50.410

<v Speaker 4>He got it.</v>

1556
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be the richest guy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

1557
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:59.970
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say that poop mythical figure here</v>

<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1561
01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:06.760
<v Speaker 4>he's a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he will become,</v>

1562
01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.760
<v Speaker 4>you're going to bet against it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>become larger than life.</v>

1563
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 4>This will make him larger than life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll just be,</v>

1564
01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 4>it'll be like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll,</v>

1565
01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:13.550
<v Speaker 4>we'll be able,</v>

1566
01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:16.400
<v Speaker 5>Beth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there is a huge scandal,</v>

1567
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 5>it's not going away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a million kids and family.</v>

1568
01:07:19.211 --> 01:07:21.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't know round for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think about what's going on in</v>

1569
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.500
<v Speaker 5>the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess Kendall make some stronger.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Billy Bush got fucking trampled on the</v>

1571
01:07:28.401 --> 01:07:32.210
<v Speaker 5>fucking on the bus thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it just made him stronger.</v>

1572
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 5>Do you think if this whole story about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Russian prostitutes pissing on him</v>

1573
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:38.300
<v Speaker 5>got corroborated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think it would hurt him?</v>

1574
01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:40.610
<v Speaker 5>I read so I read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone said that they thought he'd</v>

1575
01:07:40.611 --> 01:07:43.130
<v Speaker 5>fucking started that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1576
01:07:43.131 --> 01:07:45.440
<v Speaker 5>that's a fucking interesting angle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if he was like,</v>

1577
01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what Joe was saying.</v>

1578
01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.210
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why not hire you?</v>

1579
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hi.</v>

1580
01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.350
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the case,</v>

1581
01:07:56.351 --> 01:08:00.070
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that turned out stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>around pretty good tax or foolish</v>

1582
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.310
<v Speaker 4>because they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you've already proven that he's</v>

1583
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.380
<v Speaker 4>Kevlar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like do you get the degree?</v>

1584
01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:07.480
<v Speaker 4>He got past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grab the pussy videos,</v>

1585
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:07.980
<v Speaker 4>what did it,</v>

1586
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.630
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then conversely,</v>

1587
01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:11.600
<v Speaker 5>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you can't do anything then.</v>

1588
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:13.440
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the legitimate thing that you can</v>

1589
01:08:13.441 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 5>come out about him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you present facts,</v>

1590
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 7>they get kind of pushed away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you present these crazy news stories,</v>

1591
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:21.140
<v Speaker 7>it just fuels the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what,</v>

1592
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:23.060
<v Speaker 7>what do you do then to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good question.</v>

1593
01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 7>What does the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what does the opposition do?</v>

1594
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.310
<v Speaker 7>Because anything they come up with is</v>
<v Speaker 7>either fake news to him or it's</v>

1595
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:30.230
<v Speaker 7>something crazy that makes people go</v>
<v Speaker 7>off.</v>

1596
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How funny was that?</v>

1597
01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:32.650
<v Speaker 7>They pissed on that fucking bed than</v>
<v Speaker 7>Obama.</v>

1598
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.493
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it just becomes a,</v>

1599
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 7>then it becomes like a social bit.</v>

1600
01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.030
<v Speaker 4>The worst thing that could take place is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people decide while he's in power</v>

1601
01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:44.290
<v Speaker 4>that he can't be empower people decide</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there can't be a president anymore.</v>

1602
01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:48.100
<v Speaker 4>We've decided as a nation that we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to abolish this and we're going to</v>

1603
01:08:48.101 --> 01:08:52.330
<v Speaker 4>start a whole new system of government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is where it should,</v>

1604
01:08:52.331 --> 01:08:53.890
<v Speaker 4>could get really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would get crazy.</v>

1605
01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what Susan Surandon wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does she want that?</v>

1606
01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She remember when he was running for</v>

1607
01:08:58.061 --> 01:08:59.080
<v Speaker 7>president,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

1608
01:08:59.081 --> 01:09:01.570
<v Speaker 7>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe trump should win because maybe</v>

1609
01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.790
<v Speaker 7>it's time we do have a revolution in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>streets.</v>

1610
01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:05.380
<v Speaker 7>Maybe we need to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1611
01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.970
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's easy to say where you're on the</v>

1612
01:09:06.971 --> 01:09:10.300
<v Speaker 7>fifth fin of five story Brownstone with</v>
<v Speaker 7>guards.</v>

1613
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.290
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not fucking living in the projects there</v>

1614
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.110
<v Speaker 7>and ready to leave</v>

1615
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:18.040
<v Speaker 4>for rich person to say that a poor</v>
<v Speaker 4>person has nothing to lose him would</v>

1616
01:09:18.190 --> 01:09:20.470
<v Speaker 4>call for revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when a rich person does it,</v>

1617
01:09:20.471 --> 01:09:24.850
<v Speaker 4>I think she's got some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or did you think they become it for her</v>

1618
01:09:24.851 --> 01:09:26.080
<v Speaker 4>first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

1619
01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I talked to trump,</v>

1620
01:09:27.611 --> 01:09:28.960
<v Speaker 4>somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you do that?</v>

1621
01:09:28.961 --> 01:09:30.640
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like Hitler.</v>

1622
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:31.720
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's Hitler,</v>

1623
01:09:31.721 --> 01:09:35.140
<v Speaker 4>you'll be glad I'm friends with them</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise I can give it up.</v>

1624
01:09:35.141 --> 01:09:40.141
<v Speaker 4>Your fucking moves is in home address.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1625
01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.090
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bizarre too because he's actually</v>

1626
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.480
<v Speaker 4>like publicly supportive Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1627
01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:48.930
<v Speaker 4>and he talks about Putin being a smart</v>
<v Speaker 4>businessman.</v>

1628
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:51.910
<v Speaker 4>So He's talks with whoever he's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends with,</v>

1629
01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.440
<v Speaker 4>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>money be taken away from it.</v>

1630
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.430
<v Speaker 4>A surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll figure all that out.</v>

1631
01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.100
<v Speaker 4>But he can't pretend that these aren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>as pals.</v>

1632
01:10:00.101 --> 01:10:04.600
<v Speaker 4>And if you meet somebody famous once or</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice and they're nice to you,</v>

1633
01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:09.580
<v Speaker 4>that's all he's plus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's his stuff's deep.</v>

1634
01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:11.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would go over there,</v>

1635
01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:14.380
<v Speaker 4>he would bring tv shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all that stuff is where a</v>

1636
01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:15.430
<v Speaker 4>client,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1637
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.340
<v Speaker 4>we're another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1638
01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:22.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of commerce in his portfolio of</v>

1639
01:10:22.121 --> 01:10:24.640
<v Speaker 4>how he does business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he picks up the phone and he knows</v>

1640
01:10:24.641 --> 01:10:26.710
<v Speaker 4>some guy in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course he's going to mention his</v>

1641
01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.280
<v Speaker 4>properties and that's how he gets going.</v>

1642
01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:35.440
<v Speaker 4>What does that works</v>
<v Speaker 4>really well?</v>

1643
01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:36.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a better system.</v>

1644
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:40.140
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Putin used government and a private</v>

1645
01:10:40.141 --> 01:10:42.600
<v Speaker 7>ownership to amass fortunes,</v>

1646
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.490
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't get his friends fortunes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's kind of,</v>

1647
01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:50.080
<v Speaker 4>it's almost going to take something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this to make people realize that this is</v>

1648
01:10:50.081 --> 01:10:51.640
<v Speaker 4>a ridiculous system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1649
01:10:51.641 --> 01:10:53.860
<v Speaker 4>otherwise we would never figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just still look for a better and</v>

1650
01:10:53.861 --> 01:10:57.220
<v Speaker 4>better version of the impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we're all looking at it wrong.</v>

1651
01:10:57.221 --> 01:10:58.540
<v Speaker 4>It's such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should we've tested it?</v>

1652
01:10:58.541 --> 01:11:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Anybody can become president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1653
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.400
<v Speaker 4>maybe it is a good system because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>got,</v>

1654
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got that and it's got all the</v>

1655
01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:07.750
<v Speaker 4>checks and balances in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1656
01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it is a good system because of all</v>

1657
01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 4>the bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something beyond on what's right and</v>

1658
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've heard that argument.</v>

1659
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Dynasty is not the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's time for,</v>

1660
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization had a great run.</v>

1661
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:23.544
<v Speaker 4>What else you got?</v>

1662
01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's crazy is as dark as it can plug</v>

1663
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much is he?</v>

1664
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.310
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there are wars going on,</v>

1665
01:11:33.311 --> 01:11:36.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's wars going on right now and we</v>

1666
01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:39.850
<v Speaker 3>will always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome waitress down here.</v>

1667
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:41.530
<v Speaker 3>The fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the board is going on.</v>

1668
01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:44.800
<v Speaker 3>No drank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's wars going on right now,</v>

1669
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:46.480
<v Speaker 3>but they're just not going on right</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1670
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.060
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we just naive or we naive to not</v>

1671
01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.170
<v Speaker 3>understand the danger?</v>

1672
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be coming.</v>

1673
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

1674
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

1675
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:56.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

1676
01:11:56.901 --> 01:11:58.410
<v Speaker 5>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would stop?</v>

1677
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 5>What would stop it at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1678
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think any war with Russia is on</v>

1679
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:05.740
<v Speaker 5>a lot of barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1680
01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:06.181
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1681
01:12:06.181 --> 01:12:06.481
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1682
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:07.314
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1683
01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.620
<v Speaker 3>France or Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1684
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Why would we go to war with Germany or</v>
<v Speaker 3>France or anyone thinks is possible</v>

1685
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:17.470
<v Speaker 5>leaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well also date what you define cyber</v>

1686
01:12:17.471 --> 01:12:19.990
<v Speaker 5>warfare is is is what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1687
01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.700
<v Speaker 5>if we had natural boundaries before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now you see that they can hack into</v>

1688
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:28.270
<v Speaker 5>the FBI and the CIA and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1689
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:32.350
<v Speaker 4>it was a no one unknown now and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1690
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.430
<v Speaker 4>to presume anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1691
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.810
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

1693
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:43.630
<v Speaker 3>here's a scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would it be so crazy ideal way</v>

1694
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.670
<v Speaker 3>outside of a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would be the ideal way to run a</v>

1695
01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:48.910
<v Speaker 3>nation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whoa,</v>

1696
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 3>what would be better than having this</v>
<v Speaker 3>one alpha that we keep putting in place?</v>

1697
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Which seems pretty ridiculous at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1698
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 3>It seems like we might have fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and got a super alpha in there.</v>

1699
01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.780
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that the framers of the</v>

1700
01:13:01.781 --> 01:13:04.660
<v Speaker 5>constitution didn't see the presidency</v>
<v Speaker 5>as being such a big deal.</v>

1701
01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:07.210
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was kind of a lead administrator,</v>

1702
01:13:07.211 --> 01:13:11.140
<v Speaker 5>but he wasn't supposed to be a be all</v>
<v Speaker 5>end all the power in this country.</v>

1703
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:15.160
<v Speaker 5>And I think we probably want to ratchet</v>
<v Speaker 5>that position down.</v>

1704
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Guy that they didn't give it to them.</v>

1705
01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.480
<v Speaker 6>This is not even that cool of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a weekend.</v>

1706
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.460
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to be just a baby</v>

1707
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.290
<v Speaker 6>photo out drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sketch jobs,</v>

1708
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.680
<v Speaker 6>kind of photo ops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They head back.</v>

1709
01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was kind of a pragmatist about it.</v>

1710
01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:46.760
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't a supporter of anybody except</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1711
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:49.700
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty much,</v>

1712
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:55.270
<v Speaker 5>I was against trump winning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anybody but trump type of thing.</v>

1713
01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:56.701
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1714
01:13:56.701 --> 01:13:59.270
<v Speaker 5>So I'd love to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my wife has a big Bernie supporter.</v>

1715
01:13:59.271 --> 01:14:01.280
<v Speaker 5>I would like to say I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think I was just,</v>

1716
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.040
<v Speaker 5>I was betting on the best horse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I thought was the best because</v>

1717
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.880
<v Speaker 5>actually you didn't even make the bet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you were hope you had a horse in</v>

1718
01:14:07.881 --> 01:14:08.714
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.490
<v Speaker 5>And it didn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was like.</v>

1720
01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.353
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you lose it.</v>

1721
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1722
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:14.420
<v Speaker 5>I can't sit here and say for all the bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>things I say about trump,</v>

1723
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't sit here and tell you that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate about hillary or that I even</v>

1724
01:14:17.661 --> 01:14:18.710
<v Speaker 2>like her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1725
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I just saw it as the lesser two evils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.880
<v Speaker 2>You saw her as business as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not business way worse.</v>

1727
01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1728
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:27.621
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

1729
01:14:27.621 --> 01:14:32.550
<v Speaker 7>it seemed like it was just another thing</v>
<v Speaker 7>to sell like a woman president.</v>

1730
01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:33.450
<v Speaker 7>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Great.</v>

1731
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:36.390
<v Speaker 7>Has this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>has the relationships that exist that we</v>

1732
01:14:36.391 --> 01:14:37.440
<v Speaker 7>already know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're like,</v>

1733
01:14:37.441 --> 01:14:39.000
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was almost like,</v>

1734
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:40.290
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>If somebody doesn't pick you up,</v>

1849
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:50.720
<v Speaker 3>you know there's supposed to be someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come pick you up.</v>

1850
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have like this whole system</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess set up how that,</v>

1851
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.420
<v Speaker 3>how they get people over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda crazy man.</v>

1852
01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:00.950
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda crazy that we have like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>boundary in the dirt that we decide if</v>

1853
01:20:00.951 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 3>you're born over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

1854
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.790
<v Speaker 3>You stay over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born over here.</v>

1855
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:07.140
<v Speaker 3>You're on our team when it's all just</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1856
01:20:07.141 --> 01:20:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Just Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he pulled back from it.</v>

1857
01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 3>And you look at this connection between</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico and the United States,</v>

1858
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:16.140
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's a landmass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one landmass.</v>

1859
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Like Mexico is physically connected to</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1860
01:20:18.991 --> 01:20:20.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we were uh,</v>

1861
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be like being at war with our</v>

1862
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 3>foot or not letting our foot come in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shower,</v>

1863
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't wash.</v>

1864
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wash the whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a,</v>

1865
01:20:28.651 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>this is a part of the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>

1866
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to break it off into these</v>

1867
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 3>imaginary lines in the sand is no</v>
<v Speaker 3>different than us telling Seattle they</v>

1868
01:20:38.191 --> 01:20:40.010
<v Speaker 3>have to go fuck themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1869
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.000
<v Speaker 3>and no one from Seattle can come over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1870
01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1871
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:44.851
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1872
01:20:44.851 --> 01:20:46.740
<v Speaker 3>the obviously aren't under our</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution,</v>

1873
01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.020
<v Speaker 3>our laws or any of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're connected to us.</v>

1874
01:20:49.021 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 3>There are literally a part of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right there,</v>

1875
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:53.790
<v Speaker 6>but it's like what you said before about</v>
<v Speaker 6>tribalism.</v>

1876
01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 6>It's just so deep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1877
01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.890
<v Speaker 6>it's random and yet it's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like a sports team.</v>

1878
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 6>It's like any guy can get traded any</v>
<v Speaker 6>given year,</v>

1879
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.930
<v Speaker 6>but you're still gonna cheer for that</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking color uniform.</v>

1880
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:06.960
<v Speaker 6>Even though like a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the mets in [inaudible] 86,</v>

1881
01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:10.500
<v Speaker 6>after they won the world series,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fucking traded everybody off and</v>

1882
01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 6>they weren't the mets anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but people were still like,</v>

1883
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wearing the jerseys and cheering.</v>

1884
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

1885
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.700
<v Speaker 3>how do you stop something like that?</v>

1886
01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.270
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hope was globalism.</v>

1887
01:21:23.271 --> 01:21:24.950
<v Speaker 6>Would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that with all of us having</v>

1888
01:21:24.951 --> 01:21:27.410
<v Speaker 6>access to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our pockets with the same as people</v>

1889
01:21:27.411 --> 01:21:28.880
<v Speaker 6>from India,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they would be this,</v>

1890
01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1891
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:34.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people had this amazing image of all</v>

1892
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:37.880
<v Speaker 6>the walls falling down and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's not,</v>

1893
01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.680
<v Speaker 6>hat doesn't seem to be happening.</v>

1894
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.810
<v Speaker 7>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1895
01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.160
<v Speaker 7>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're getting,</v>

1896
01:21:42.161 --> 01:21:43.570
<v Speaker 7>we're getting more connected,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

1897
01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.440
<v Speaker 7>but culture means a lot to people and</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're going to keep it and that's,</v>

1898
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:50.860
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that identifies them with who they are.</v>

1899
01:21:50.861 --> 01:21:54.490
<v Speaker 7>So they're never going to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 7>that and just become super otherwise,</v>

1900
01:21:54.491 --> 01:21:55.001
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1901
01:21:55.001 --> 01:21:59.170
<v Speaker 7>the westernization of the world would</v>
<v Speaker 7>just be with them all being us.</v>

1902
01:21:59.171 --> 01:21:59.800
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what would that,</v>

1903
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.780
<v Speaker 7>what's the end to answer?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like everyone should be the same,</v>

1904
01:22:01.781 --> 01:22:06.190
<v Speaker 7>but most places you go around the world</v>
<v Speaker 7>that are Westernized,</v>

1905
01:22:06.191 --> 01:22:07.510
<v Speaker 7>quote unquote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that are globalized.</v>

1906
01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:08.620
<v Speaker 7>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it looks like us.</v>

1907
01:22:08.621 --> 01:22:08.920
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

1908
01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1909
01:22:09.611 --> 01:22:14.611
<v Speaker 3>we know for a fact that apple goes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>China and pays people pennies and they</v>

1910
01:22:15.221 --> 01:22:18.500
<v Speaker 3>have nets are on the buildings where</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people live and work.</v>

1911
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:21.400
<v Speaker 3>They have dormitories and they cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>them with nets.</v>

1912
01:22:21.401 --> 01:22:22.870
<v Speaker 3>We know about Foxconn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>

1913
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:24.550
<v Speaker 3>we know that story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we know.</v>

1914
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:29.650
<v Speaker 3>And we still bodies fucking phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even think twice again twice.</v>

1915
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:32.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucking jumpers make a hell of a</v>

1916
01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:34.030
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1917
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.390
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus breast,</v>

1918
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:39.730
<v Speaker 3>a little a $1 an hour hearts or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they get paid.</v>

1919
01:22:39.731 --> 01:22:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And we accept that and we accept that</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just in China,</v>

1920
01:22:43.121 --> 01:22:48.070
<v Speaker 3>but all throughout South America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different factories</v>

1921
01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:52.450
<v Speaker 3>that employ people that pay them pennies</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to what they would have to pay</v>

1922
01:22:52.451 --> 01:22:55.210
<v Speaker 3>the same person in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's saying that we care,</v>

1923
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.370
<v Speaker 3>we care less about them because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Americans.</v>

1924
01:22:57.370 --> 01:22:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:01.660
<v Speaker 3>We literally allow people to give them</v>
<v Speaker 3>slave wages.</v>

1926
01:23:01.661 --> 01:23:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would consider slave wage.</v>

1927
01:23:03.201 --> 01:23:08.201
<v Speaker 3>Just like if someone took a guy you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>made you work for 14,000 on that,</v>

1928
01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:11.050
<v Speaker 3>you know the Blah Blah Blah factory that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you know,</v>

1929
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:13.810
<v Speaker 3>fucking jeans or sneakers or wherever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they make.</v>

1930
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:18.070
<v Speaker 3>If they made you work for that amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think you were in jail.</v>

1931
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1932
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I have to live off of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people control me,</v>

1933
01:23:21.491 --> 01:23:22.590
<v Speaker 3>they own me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1934
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:26.590
<v Speaker 3>they have paralyzed me with poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no way I'll ever be able to</v>

1935
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:29.300
<v Speaker 3>escape this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only argument against it is a</v>

1936
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.270
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the quality of their life is much</v>

1937
01:23:31.271 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 3>better than it was before the factory</v>
<v Speaker 3>got there.</v>

1938
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the factory,</v>

1939
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 3>not there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody made any money at all because</v>

1940
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:37.990
<v Speaker 3>they were eating coconuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mangoes,</v>

1941
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 3>and they were catching fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't need any money.</v>

1942
01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I you made them work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of these places where</v>

1943
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 3>you're setting up shop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'd been there for thousands and</v>

1944
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't need the factory.</v>

1945
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe the factory is nice to them.</v>

1946
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it does.</v>

1947
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they do become dependent upon it</v>
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>

1948
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 3>But people have existed everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the planet without factories</v>

1949
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.950
<v Speaker 3>for a long fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need that factory there.</v>

1950
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.460
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of other solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an either or proposition.</v>

1951
01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Like either the factories there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never get their shit together.</v>

1952
01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.151
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1953
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 3>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they could,</v>

1954
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:15.010
<v Speaker 3>they could develop their own culture and</v>
<v Speaker 3>society just like the United States did.</v>

1955
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 3>But if you just make them in prison to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these factories where they get paid</v>

1956
01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 3>slave wages in these foreign third world</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries that we don't care about as</v>

1957
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:27.040
<v Speaker 3>much as we care about Detroit or we care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Chicago or were care about places</v>

1958
01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:29.920
<v Speaker 3>that are just like that place connected</v>
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>

1959
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm a Cami or something,</v>

1960
01:24:34.331 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1961
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.850
<v Speaker 3>It's God Damn Kami talk real realist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gross.</v>

1962
01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing of not letting those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people over here is gross.</v>

1963
01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.600
<v Speaker 3>It's you're going to have ended</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually like when you get to keep it</v>

1964
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:48.820
<v Speaker 3>like that for a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million years now we're going to have</v>

1965
01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 3>states and you can't cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't immigrate from Mexico.</v>

1966
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:54.670
<v Speaker 3>So million years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still going to have deep poverty</v>

1967
01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 3>in Mexico and we're terrified of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug war and leaking over our soil.</v>

1968
01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's going to go on a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now?</v>

1969
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:00.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to fucking,</v>

1970
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:04.990
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be one united planet once</v>
<v Speaker 3>super organism that they can read each</v>

1971
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:07.250
<v Speaker 3>other's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federation,</v>

1972
01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 3>a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a corporation.</v>

1973
01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 3>This is a hiccup along gigantic trail</v>
<v Speaker 3>that leads from us throwing shit at each</v>

1974
01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:19.300
<v Speaker 3>other from a tree to us being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcend literal space and time,</v>

1975
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:23.170
<v Speaker 3>become a part of some artificially</v>
<v Speaker 3>created dimension that they establish</v>

1976
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:25.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hundred years from now or 200</v>

1977
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:27.200
<v Speaker 3>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like a,</v>

1978
01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:29.890
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing we're going through</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now is a blip in time.</v>

1979
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's also a challenge to how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

1980
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really connects us.</v>

1981
01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:39.850
<v Speaker 3>So it like this guy's going to present a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of challenges as to like how much</v>

1982
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:42.220
<v Speaker 3>technology can unite human beings.</v>

1983
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.400
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem is,</v>

1984
01:25:43.401 --> 01:25:45.440
<v Speaker 5>and you and I were talking earlier</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

1985
01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:47.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the law called again?</v>

1986
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:52.220
<v Speaker 5>Moore's law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moore's law that every two years this</v>

1987
01:25:52.221 --> 01:25:56.990
<v Speaker 5>speed of computers and the memory of</v>
<v Speaker 5>computers doubles and at that's held</v>

1988
01:25:56.991 --> 01:26:00.170
<v Speaker 5>true since the guy came up with the law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was in like 1960.</v>

1989
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:01.430
<v Speaker 5>That's the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1990
01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Jamie Moore's law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1991
01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:04.763
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1992
01:26:05.130 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 6>and the problem with it is I'm reading</v>
<v Speaker 6>this book right now about it and the</v>

1993
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:13.340
<v Speaker 6>problem with it is that we can't keep up</v>
<v Speaker 6>culturally,</v>

1994
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:18.490
<v Speaker 6>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>legally with how fast information is,</v>

1995
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:22.040
<v Speaker 6>is a traveling and how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you said,</v>

1996
01:26:22.041 --> 01:26:24.620
<v Speaker 6>it's become,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody has access to the same</v>

1997
01:26:24.621 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 6>information,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's also just,</v>

1998
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:29.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ramifications of,</v>

1999
01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>corporations being able to get into your</v>

2000
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we don't have laws in place that</v>

2001
01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 6>can really tackle that because it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>happening so fast.</v>

2002
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:42.110
<v Speaker 6>You look at Airbnb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't have laws in place for people</v>

2003
01:26:42.111 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 6>renting out their places,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all paying taxes on using your own car</v>

2004
01:26:46.461 --> 01:26:51.461
<v Speaker 6>to drive people as a taxi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're like a one step behind progress</v>

2005
01:26:51.531 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 6>and we're going to stay that way because</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's happening so fast.</v>

2006
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.960
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2007
01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I saw a taxi today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want,</v>

2008
01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be like one of those</v>

2009
01:27:00.831 --> 01:27:02.110
<v Speaker 3>payphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this car,</v>

2011
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.510
<v Speaker 3>this guy's drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2012
01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be a payphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duke,</v>

2013
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:10.510
<v Speaker 3>we're just gonna have prejudices and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to use people who are</v>

2014
01:27:10.511 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 3>going to take uber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better,</v>

2015
01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in big cities is uber sort of</v>

2016
01:27:15.601 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 3>replacing the cabs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making it tough for cabs and probably</v>

2017
01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Speaker 3>buses and the private limo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly now it's starting to cut into</v>

2018
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:27.500
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are not needing a car in major</v>

2019
01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 3>cities in La and it's cuts out all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking and driving shit.</v>

2020
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I watched somebody slam into a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier last night.</v>

2021
01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2022
01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:39.530
<v Speaker 3>I was driving home last night and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this guy driving home from the ice</v>

2023
01:27:39.531 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 3>house cause this guy to the left to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was speeding and he was a flying</v>

2024
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:46.610
<v Speaker 3>by me man and he was losing control of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his car a little bit,</v>

2025
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:49.010
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit like it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2026
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 3>he was just wiggling a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was wet.</v>

2027
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:53.000
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roads were wet and uh,</v>

2028
01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:56.990
<v Speaker 3>this guy was just driving way too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably hydroplaning and a,</v>

2029
01:27:56.991 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I said this guy is just not keeping it</v>
<v Speaker 3>together good.</v>

2030
01:27:59.721 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 3>He might be trunk or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swipe,</v>

2031
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:05.210
<v Speaker 3>pull over two lanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give them some space and a minute</v>

2032
01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:08.330
<v Speaker 3>after I do that bang hits the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2033
01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:12.050
<v Speaker 3>The cement barrier spins out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2034
01:28:12.051 --> 01:28:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Spins again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked his car up.</v>

2035
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you come to a stand still in the</v>

2036
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:19.580
<v Speaker 3>middle of the highway came to a stop in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left lane.</v>

2037
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to turn in the right direction.</v>

2038
01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately his car was fucked up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2039
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:28.460
<v Speaker 3>He might not have been able to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was at least looking that way.</v>

2040
01:28:28.461 --> 01:28:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Cause sometimes it's wind up sideways</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you wind up sideways on the</v>

2041
01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:35.570
<v Speaker 3>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked because not everybody's</v>

2042
01:28:35.571 --> 01:28:38.570
<v Speaker 3>going to see you and it doesn't look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rear tail light.</v>

2043
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:41.240
<v Speaker 3>So you're not getting the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflection that you get.</v>

2044
01:28:41.241 --> 01:28:43.520
<v Speaker 3>If you saw taillights you put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy was stopped in front of you,</v>

2045
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:44.600
<v Speaker 3>you saw those taillights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2046
01:28:44.601 --> 01:28:46.100
<v Speaker 3>you would know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh there's a car there.</v>

2047
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes when people are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally paying attention and you,</v>

2048
01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:52.550
<v Speaker 3>here's a car that's sideways parked on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the road,</v>

2049
01:28:52.551 --> 01:28:56.420
<v Speaker 3>like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I watched that happen once.</v>

2050
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I was in um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York and I was coming home from a</v>

2051
01:28:59.391 --> 01:29:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Gig with my friend John and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were driving and there was a car that</v>

2052
01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 3>was stopped dead in the left lane and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2053
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.160
<v Speaker 3>it had hazard lights on but the hazard</v>
<v Speaker 3>lights were dying.</v>

2054
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.920
<v Speaker 3>There was like super damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no battery juice and I saw it</v>

2055
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:21.060
<v Speaker 3>and I changed lanes quick but not that</v>
<v Speaker 3>far away from it.</v>

2056
01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely missed it.</v>

2057
01:29:22.801 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 3>I missed it by like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2058
01:29:23.911 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 3>50 yards or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>close enough where it was like,</v>

2059
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I look in my rear view and this</v>

2060
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:35.121
<v Speaker 3>guy plows into it at full speed and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the cars in my rear view as I'm</v>

2061
01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see them spinning in the rear view</v>

2062
01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 3>mirror and I'm realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are probably dying.</v>

2063
01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at dead people because they</v>

2064
01:29:42.871 --> 01:29:47.680
<v Speaker 3>hit that thing going 70 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just slammed into it and everything's</v>

2065
01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:49.750
<v Speaker 3>spinning stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Visions of,</v>

2066
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 3>of a plain car crash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so scary.</v>

2067
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a guy,</v>

2068
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.373
<v Speaker 7>bad car,</v>
<v Speaker 7>car,</v>

2069
01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 7>car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been banged around and spin around</v>

2070
01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 7>mostly when I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2071
01:30:01.351 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 7>old tires as a teenager but not like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking wreck wreck.</v>

2072
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 7>I got in a couple of smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not too bad.</v>

2073

<v Speaker 3>something with a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize how crazy car travel is and</v>

<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it takes,</v>

2099
01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:15.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've all been,</v>

2100
01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've fallen asleep at the wheel on the</v>

2101
01:31:17.951 --> 01:31:20.530
<v Speaker 5>highway at night ice to drive from</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boston back to New York.</v>

2102
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.970
<v Speaker 5>Saturday night I would do two shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I get my car wherever the fuck I</v>

2103
01:31:24.971 --> 01:31:29.680
<v Speaker 5>was and I would drive to New York that</v>
<v Speaker 5>night and I can remember windows open</v>

2104
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:33.880
<v Speaker 5>singing as loud as I could it just</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I would close my eyes and I</v>

2105
01:31:33.881 --> 01:31:35.800
<v Speaker 5>would fucking wake up on the shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 5>was craig.</v>

2106
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.960
<v Speaker 5>I think about how many times I could</v>
<v Speaker 5>have died,</v>

2107
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:41.500
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember when I was a teenager,</v>

2108
01:31:41.501 --> 01:31:45.700
<v Speaker 5>there was this 69 cougar that I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to buy from this kid named Billy</v>

2109
01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.610
<v Speaker 5>Arduino and it was a muscle car and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>had it fucking jacked up.</v>

2110
01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.710
<v Speaker 5>It was a motor head and I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>buy this.</v>

2111
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:55.530
<v Speaker 7>Where did you get from Terry town now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The order windows.</v>

2112
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:57.800
<v Speaker 7>And so this other kid bought it and</v>

2113
01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 5>driving down nine</v>

2114
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.860
<v Speaker 3>right in front of the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a two lane road but it goes like 50</v>

2115
01:32:02.861 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a,</v>

2116
01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I see the car and it's driving in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of me and has a light rain and uh,</v>

2117
01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:12.580

<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck happened but</v>

2118
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:16.420
<v Speaker 3>he started going back and forth fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>tail and the fish tail.</v>

2119
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I think he was gunning it cause he saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and he was trying to be a bad ass.</v>

2120
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When in the opposite lane hit this</v>

2121
01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:27.841

01:38:09.821 --> 01:38:14.470
<v Speaker 7>people in a world right now where pc and</v>
<v Speaker 7>people on their toes and who knows what</v>

<v Speaker 7>being represented in the comedy world</v>

2251
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:25.600
<v Speaker 7>because it fucking lightens everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It makes everything,</v>

2252
01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 7>all the voices shut the fuck up and</v>
<v Speaker 7>enjoy two people making fun of each</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:34.810
<v Speaker 7>It's like the gates,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the most clean thing that we need</v>

2255
01:38:34.811 --> 01:38:38.410
<v Speaker 7>in an entertainment and especially for</v>
<v Speaker 7>comedy because dude,</v>

2256
01:38:38.411 --> 01:38:42.040
<v Speaker 7>right now I feel like you're on tippy</v>
<v Speaker 7>toes sometimes when you do shows in</v>

2257
01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:43.180
<v Speaker 7>places and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do I,</v>

2258

<v Speaker 7>you're going to get offended by and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that fucking there's,</v>

2260
01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.200
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's so weird is that when we were</v>

2261
01:38:51.201 --> 01:38:52.460
<v Speaker 6>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2262
01:38:52.461 --> 01:38:56.300
<v Speaker 6>like I know Joe and I were really in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>bill hex and like I didn't necessarily</v>

2263
01:38:56.301 --> 01:38:59.270
<v Speaker 6>agree with everything about his</v>
<v Speaker 6>politics.</v>

2264
01:38:59.271 --> 01:39:02.540
<v Speaker 6>Certainly with kinison.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't believe in any of his politics,</v>

2265
01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.920
<v Speaker 6>but I fucking loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And now as a comedian,</v>

2266
01:39:07.130 --> 01:39:10.550
<v Speaker 6>the crowd has an expectation that they</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to agree with you.</v>

2267
01:39:10.551 --> 01:39:13.040
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that they'll actually yell out if</v>

2268
01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:15.200
<v Speaker 6>they disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like that's not an option.</v>

2269
01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:20.610
<v Speaker 2>The last name guys like not funny.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2271
01:39:21.661 --> 01:39:23.940
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they feel like they have the right</v>

2272
01:39:23.941 --> 01:39:25.860
<v Speaker 2>now because they're so used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>commenting on things.</v>

2273
01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We troll to each other's faces.</v>

2277
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

2280
01:39:38.821 --> 01:39:39.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2283
01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:51.660
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes the ball goes out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bounds and sometimes it doesn't work.</v>

2284
01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.000
<v Speaker 2>At times he hit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2285
01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you fucking smash it right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their face.</v>

2286
01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really is</v>

2287
01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.010
<v Speaker 6>less people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>

2288
01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:04.050

<v Speaker 6>to go to when if you go harder.</v>

2289
01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:06.730
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean is that too many people that lose</v>

2290
01:40:06.731 --> 01:40:08.290
<v Speaker 6>by going too far?</v>

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:38.780
<v Speaker 7>failure and comedy is still a thing</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not just like everything's not</v>

2304
01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:41.990
<v Speaker 7>just a special prefabricated a late</v>
<v Speaker 7>nights set.</v>

2305
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:45.800
<v Speaker 7>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they only see comedy in that</v>

2306
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:47.720
<v Speaker 7>way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they see specials on Netflix,</v>

2307
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:50.960
<v Speaker 7>they see blade nights sets,</v>
<v Speaker 7>things that are tight in our formula</v>

2308
01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 7>that had been practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then when they come see live comedy,</v>

2309
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:58.090
<v Speaker 7>I know an inch of any sort of faltering</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think I'm trying to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>

2418
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders seems like a g.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2419
01:45:01.311 --> 01:45:02.060
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

2420
01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 2>He to me does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seemed like a bowling ball but,</v>

2421
01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:05.990
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2422
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:09.290
<v Speaker 2>but don't we know that anybody who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the audacity and fucking self</v>

2423
01:45:09.291 --> 01:45:13.070
<v Speaker 2>indulgence to want to be president is</v>
<v Speaker 2>also behind the true fucking crazy.</v>

2424
01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's a nice person.</v>

2425
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I was there for the right reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I beg to differ Bernie 22 years in the</v>

2426
01:45:21.021 --> 01:45:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Senate or the mayor of my town of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

2427
01:45:23.361 --> 01:45:27.210
<v Speaker 2>isn't it possible that someone could not</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be president until they realize</v>

2428
01:45:27.211 --> 01:45:30.170
<v Speaker 2>that the country is back is up against</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall and that's when he finally ran</v>

2429
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.890
<v Speaker 2>is that it is possible for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that there was no hope on the</v>

2430
01:45:33.891 --> 01:45:38.200
<v Speaker 2>horizon for the status quo or this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>new thing,</v>

2431
01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:41.090
<v Speaker 2>this trump thing and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll go.</v>

2432
01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think had had had the DNC not</v>

2433
01:45:44.751 --> 01:45:47.720
<v Speaker 2>fucking strategically shoved Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton in front of him?</v>

2434
01:45:47.721 --> 01:45:52.040
<v Speaker 2>If he had fucking one do youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think he could be trump?</v>

2435
01:45:52.690 --> 01:45:54.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an,</v>

2436
01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just an open speculation.</v>

2437
01:45:58.790 --> 01:46:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how it would've played out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2439
01:46:02.781 --> 01:46:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I would love not something I'm prepared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to discuss at this time,</v>

2440
01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.510

<v Speaker 2>or what do you think you would have</v>

2442
01:46:09.651 --> 01:46:12.710
<v Speaker 2>fucking beat trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would have give him a run for</v>

2443
01:46:12.711 --> 01:46:14.220
<v Speaker 2>his money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our water,</v>

<v Speaker 2>lucky states.</v>

01:46:21.601 --> 01:46:24.180
<v Speaker 4>You had it down and cut the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have been very competitive with</v>

2448
01:46:24.181 --> 01:46:25.860
<v Speaker 4>the trump campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 7>He was like,</v>

2495

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.360
<v Speaker 7>what's the fucking spin on that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said it was,</v>

2499
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:45.330
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't because he was hint,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just watch it once.</v>

2500
01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.130
<v Speaker 7>Volume off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Watch it once.</v>

2501
01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:52.000
<v Speaker 7>No one in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If someone who speaks no English and as</v>

2502
01:48:52.001 --> 01:48:54.170
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our culture would go well.</v>

2503
01:48:54.171 --> 01:48:56.550
<v Speaker 7>They're probably making fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Looks like they're making fun.</v>

2504
01:48:56.551 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 7>I'll make him a of character of</v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody.</v>

2505
01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:00.090
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was this kid,</v>

2506
01:49:00.091 --> 01:49:02.680
<v Speaker 7>he was a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does that about everybody that he</v>

2507
01:49:02.681 --> 01:49:06.030
<v Speaker 7>thinks is flustered.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's like a whole series really</v>

2508
01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.291
<v Speaker 7>thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>

2509
01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he does that with when no one knows what</v>

2510
01:49:09.691 --> 01:49:10.411
<v Speaker 7>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2511
01:49:10.411 --> 01:49:14.640
<v Speaker 7>and he's trying to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Literally that's his thing that he does</v>

2512
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:18.690
<v Speaker 7>when I'm not defending him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the real fact is he always does.</v>

2513
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.340
<v Speaker 7>I right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They showed a video of the loop it but,</v>

2514
01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:24.060
<v Speaker 7>but specifically he did like this arm</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing like that.</v>

2515
01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>More specific,</v>

2516
01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:30.880
<v Speaker 7>more extra sassy like risks banging</v>
<v Speaker 7>against each other.</v>

2517
01:49:30.881 --> 01:49:34.200
<v Speaker 7>Can you have a move?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does this in some of them open handy</v>

2518
01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:38.370
<v Speaker 7>and then this was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was just like what you would</v>

2519
01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:41.850
<v Speaker 7>when you were a punk kid in third grade</v>
<v Speaker 7>or fourth grade was we're doing to each</v>

2520
01:49:41.851 --> 01:49:45.540
<v Speaker 7>other mocking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like so obvious that that's what</v>

2521
01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:46.800
<v Speaker 7>the boys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this comic,</v>

2522
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 7>and I know you guys probably</v>

2523
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:49.960
<v Speaker 5>won't even remember him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was in la comic,</v>

2524
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 5>one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just always around and you never</v>

2525
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:55.630
<v Speaker 5>really saw him go on stage much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Earl Skakel and he,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a receded upper lip so that his teeth</v>

2528
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:06.520
<v Speaker 5>just like jutted out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm talking to him and I don't know</v>
