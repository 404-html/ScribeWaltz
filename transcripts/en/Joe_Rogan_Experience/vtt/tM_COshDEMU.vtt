00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm here with my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniella,</v>

3
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:24.131
<v Speaker 2>but lily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the few men who can pull off a </v>

4
00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>union gang Bandana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some renegade bike or on an episode</v>

5
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 2>of Grey's anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking thing,</v>

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking balance it out with a Frank </v>

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Frazetta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conan the barbarian tee shirt.</v>

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 2>That shirt is the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you pick that up?</v>

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking all over the place for it.</v>

10
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 2>They probably had it for like some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comic book store Milione are sickle </v>

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.311
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that was a dope shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have to hide that one for my </v>

12
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 2>wife because she probably tried to throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>

13
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

14
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>You know women are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 2>This contains Saturday decent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good in life.</v>

16
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's time to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you shouldn't have a comic book </v>

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 2>guy and your shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fucking comic book.</v>

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 2>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a novel.</v>

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Robert e Dot Howard wrote a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>novels.</v>

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 2>It's about Conan the barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't know.</v>

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like my entire life philosophy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>based off of our barrier like galaxies </v>

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>called mentoree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get in trouble for that kind of </v>

23
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

24
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Crombs a good God could obviously solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't give a fuck of here </v>

25
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 2>to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

26
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Not going to save you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty of the color.</v>

27
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 2>It's very real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

28
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 2>life is tough deal to fuck with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the way it's going to be.</v>

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Yet there are horrible things that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

31
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Yet there's no guarantees about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>

32
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

33
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 2>But in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are women.</v>

34
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 2>There's red wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enemies to be killed,</v>

35
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>or Marty wants probably parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of weird diseases.</v>

36
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever diagnosed yet that parties</v>
<v Speaker 2>did last year as I feel you're lucky you</v>

37
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:57.991
<v Speaker 2>live to 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of amazing when they keep </v>

38
00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:58.900
<v Speaker 2>finding these new species of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 2>they've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had this article yesterday where </v>

41
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've examined the teeth,</v>

42
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 2>the teeth of the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the island of Flores.</v>

43
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 2>And so now they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 2>99 point nine percent positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent,</v>

45
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 2>not 99 point nine percent positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>

46
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:20.141
<v Speaker 2>but 99 point nine percent positive that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely different species of </v>

47
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found the teeth of these things and</v>

48
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think like that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 14,000</v>

49
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>and we don't even remember those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

51
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 2>They've sort of become like this weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>little legend,</v>

52
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 2>like how many different versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were out there and what a hard </v>

53
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 2>scrabble life it must have been extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shootings,</v>

54
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 2>the name of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

55
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:46.961
<v Speaker 2>when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like overwhelming majority of pieces </v>

56
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:46.961
<v Speaker 2>that I've ever been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've all gone extent.</v>

57
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than 90 percent,</v>

58
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

59
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

60
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my point.</v>

61
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Calling on the throats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bear claws,</v>

63
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 2>runs neck.</v>

64
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking awesome picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.250
<v Speaker 2>That's why I it in my house as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollster,</v>

66
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I might have to be obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a bunch of his old books for </v>

67
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.711
<v Speaker 2>Zetas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old books like sketch books and books </v>

68
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:10.711
<v Speaker 2>that are collections of his paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God,</v>

69
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 2>that kind of art that he did was just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicative of that time.</v>

70
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:19.291
<v Speaker 2>It was like so 19 seventies fantasy art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those days,</v>

71
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 2>but no one has really captured it </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly in a movie.</v>

73
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.430
<v Speaker 2>They just have not done it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't,</v>

74
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you didn't think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one was fun and it was campy,</v>

75
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 2>but it was more like the comic book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it was like the books.</v>

76
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I think Jason Mamoa was the best version</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cone and physically he looked just </v>

77
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>the beginning that it was dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shameful.</v>

78
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Their movie was dog shit.</v>

79
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>That guy is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

80
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Jason Mamoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

81
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>In game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

82
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.930
<v Speaker 2>He seemed like the most likely Conan </v>
<v Speaker 2>might have to get them on the Jews </v>

83
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.291
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's that to get them on some </v>

84
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.771
<v Speaker 2>fucking heavy duty powerlifting program </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he has to look a little more yoked</v>

85
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 2>because Conan was just supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously impressive as a person.</v>

86
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I knew in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they put power and old as the first</v>

87
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:18.601
<v Speaker 2>one that's kind of high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sets the bar pretty high right </v>

88
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:18.601
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

89
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 2>But Arnold was built incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had all these unnecessary like big </v>

90
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 2>titty muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

91
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 2>you need a guy who's built more like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoel Romero,</v>

92
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a barbarian Yoel Romero.</v>

93
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 2>The sword was me just to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're here and I want you to feel </v>

94
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

95
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.660
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can accept limits.</v>

96
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me about your book man.</v>

97
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Not Afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 2>on fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heartbreak,</v>

99
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 2>raising a baby girl and cage fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an unusual combination of things.</v>

100
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

101
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me these was um,</v>

102
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 2>oldest stuff I've written so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going to have more Fritos,</v>

103
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Alfie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting nature,</v>

104
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 2>DC's a bit more personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These is very much um,</v>

105
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of divided up into three </v>

106
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.911
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first part is about dealing with </v>

107
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Fiori martial arts and he's kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience.</v>

108
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Self stumps with the testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The boundaries are getting crashed.</v>

109
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Try again to find a way to make a deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the skating feeling of when you </v>

110
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 2>have somebody coming in at you always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been training for the last few years and</v>

111
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 2>wants to take your head off and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

112
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a little intimidating.</v>

113
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.060
<v Speaker 2>There's all the pressure of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching you.</v>

114
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.330
<v Speaker 2>The idea of getting fees if you fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting fuzzy,</v>

115
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>cuddly dominated by another man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is never a fun feeling.</v>

116
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shift and so that's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

117
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 2>But then to me that fire just serves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a spring board for the other stuff which</v>

118
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:49.261
<v Speaker 2>is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good age when you are on the </v>

119
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:49.261
<v Speaker 2>match when you're in the cage for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

120
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 2>But what about the rest of life and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this case,</v>

121
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:55.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part tool deals with what happened with </v>

122
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:55.241
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Betty Quique,</v>

123
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a southern.</v>

124
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going</v>

125
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 3>on in your bodies are falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosed with brain tumor that within </v>

126
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 3>six months from the time the first scene</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don came up.</v>

127
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.310
<v Speaker 3>So it was really quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really harsh.</v>

128
00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>When will the stuff that you may imagine</v>
<v Speaker 3>with debts and then the power three sort</v>

129
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

130
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:18.791
<v Speaker 3>now what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I do with it now and life </v>

131
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 3>afterwards when when my wife died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter was 19 months old,</v>

132
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:26.171
<v Speaker 3>the old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit was happening as you might </v>

133
00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:28.391
<v Speaker 3>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's like in some way that the </v>

134
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:31.770
<v Speaker 3>story elements kind of go together is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the martial art part was circled </v>

135
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.281
<v Speaker 3>for water mop in terms of learning some </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that then I would have to apply </v>

136
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:39.971
<v Speaker 3>on a much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more important scale in day to day life </v>

137
00:06:39.971 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when shit hits the fan and then </v>

138
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.380
<v Speaker 3>afterwards would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That changes my attitude about sayings,</v>

139
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.570
<v Speaker 3>my life overall and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

140
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 3>when I was talking with publishers or </v>
<v Speaker 3>regionality,</v>

141
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:55.121
<v Speaker 3>they wanted a nice pretty arch or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start out as the scared we wimp and then</v>

142
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 3>you discover the secrets and then you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back and Yardi,</v>

143
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 3>fearless guy will go through life </v>
<v Speaker 3>without fear.</v>

144
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

145
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I like to sell it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would sound cool,</v>

146
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not in the business of bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my saddle for anybody else.</v>

147
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.030
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the seven steps to get rid of.</v>

148
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Fear is not that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

149
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my experience self dealing with fear,</v>

150
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.880
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking constant battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

151
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like you wake up a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

152
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.180
<v Speaker 3>you woke up one day and maybe you will </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to deal with it.</v>

153
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.540
<v Speaker 3>The zero point zero one percent better </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a win and that the next day a</v>

154
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 3>tto again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to deal with it again.</v>

155
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Like for me in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what afterwards,</v>

156
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 3>what happened is the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing that everything is fleeting.</v>

157
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Everything can be taken away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything you care about can go in the </v>

158
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 3>snap of a finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really freaked me out.</v>

159
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 3>You know that I use one thing to know it</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually is one thing when it hits</v>

160
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 3>home for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so once in a while,</v>

161
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left my days when I'm totally fine,</v>

162
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I feel strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel great,</v>

163
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden will hit me </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the thought of men,</v>

164
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.350
<v Speaker 3>everybody I love will die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

165
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 3>I've limited control of what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in my life.</v>

166
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Everything I care about can be taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>away from me in a second shift.</v>

167
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to your day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now deal with the next 24 hours is like </v>

168
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 3>savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so dealing with that aspect,</v>

169
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 3>finding ways to and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I find a way to do it.</v>

170
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 3>And then a month later we'll hit you </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

171
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Speaker 3>And maybe because you found a way to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it before he actually delay.</v>

172
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think that's everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no one.</v>

173
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.360
<v Speaker 4>This is a false narrative that someone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out how to get rid of fear.</v>

174
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.820
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have no fear,</v>

175
00:08:38.821 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 4>that means that you're not experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 4>any danger or anything unknown.</v>

176
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 4>And somehow or another you're a mortal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

177
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Because if you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of death,</v>

178
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.490
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get afraid if you're </v>

179
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:53.790
<v Speaker 4>taking any sort of risks or chances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get nervous.</v>

180
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
<v Speaker 4>It's part of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Part of it's part of what's fun about </v>

181
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.390
<v Speaker 4>getting things done in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in succeeding is knowing all the mental </v>

182
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 4>roadblocks that are in place to keep you</v>
<v Speaker 4>from being successful big time,</v>

183
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 4>and that's the way today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They affect everybody.</v>

184
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 4>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just,</v>

185
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

186
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my experience,</v>

187
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:16.251
<v Speaker 4>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I have any illusion that </v>

188
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:16.251
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fighting battles that are unknown to</v>

189
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 4>other people because the reality is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has shit to deal with.</v>

190
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 4>Know every body has horrible things </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to them.</v>

191
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 4>Every body and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible may Vadie for one person to the</v>

192
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:32.151
<v Speaker 4>next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You may be slightly luckier than the </v>

193
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:34.431
<v Speaker 4>next guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is that everybody deal </v>

194
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:36.231
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question of how do you deal with </v>

195
00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:38.901
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the things that I help you get </v>

196
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 4>the job done and which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the great things about </v>

197
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.021
<v Speaker 4>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dealing with the fear and the </v>

198
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:47.990
<v Speaker 4>pressure and stress of training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It helps mitigate some of the pressures </v>

199
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.710
<v Speaker 4>and stresses of everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

200
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.820
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>

201
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I went to some publishers </v>

202
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 4>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

203
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

204
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your wife life.</v>

205
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 4>After we got that part about what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact is,</v>

206
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 4>martial art I've had to do with data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

207
00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:59.620
<v Speaker 4>and it says everything to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

208
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 4>because those are the same dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I get to train them in a safe space,</v>

209
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 4>know martial art contest and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>apply them to the real game.</v>

210
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm the big girl scaling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a controlled space and in terms of </v>

211
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.460
<v Speaker 4>it's going to happen at 8:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>on Tuesday nights.</v>

212
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 4>You get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

213
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:16.790
<v Speaker 4>it's like you can prepare for you eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you,</v>

214
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 4>make sure you have your meal is digested</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your stomach before you get there.</v>

215
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 4>You have a cup of coffee before you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the gym.</v>

216
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.770
<v Speaker 4>You stretch out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you prepare yourself and then you go </v>

217
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:27.770
<v Speaker 4>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

218
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 4>but in doing that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it definitely helps.</v>

219
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

220
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 4>I've had so many twitter messages and </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook messages and people that I meet</v>

221
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:38.151
<v Speaker 4>after shows that told me that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>started Jujitsu after listening to this </v>

222
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 4>podcast and it changed their life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it helps them so much and deal with</v>

223
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 4>pressure and now in pursuing a health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a healthy lifestyle.</v>

224
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Like even guys like Anthony Bourdain who</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in his fifties,</v>

225
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was 58 when he started </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu,</v>

226
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 4>the eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>58,</v>

227
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 4>57 or 58.</v>

228
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a lifetime smoker.</v>

229
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:02.421
<v Speaker 4>Heroin user,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like pretty much like abused </v>

230
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu and he loves it and it's sort of</v>

237
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:26.330
<v Speaker 4>transformed his life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's her life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it by promising him narcotics,</v>

245
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the most hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories ever.</v>

246
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 4>She said like,</v>

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm in Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he's the one of the few guys</v>

249
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.250
<v Speaker 2>that has been like a self professed </v>
<v Speaker 2>junkie but was not only able to kick it,</v>

250
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still get high,</v>

251
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>still drink and obviously doesn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

252
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It's very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do anything when he's at home</v>

253
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's on the road in filming a show </v>

254
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 2>and the fillings done and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 2>have a few drinks or even while filming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

256
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he's got a problem.</v>

257
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.370
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely is now a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've hung out with him.</v>

258
00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

259
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 2>he's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

260
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:26.041
<v Speaker 2>that's as good as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to fire tea without paying </v>

261
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:28.381
<v Speaker 2>the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's amazing because everybody has </v>

262
00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.391
<v Speaker 2>this idea where most people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery that you can't do anything </v>

263
00:12:30.391 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very few people I know that we'll</v>

264
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:36.451
<v Speaker 2>do something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a few guys who had alcohol </v>

265
00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:36.451
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll smoke a little pot,</v>

266
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

267
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a little mushrooms every now and then</v>

268
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

269
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 2>But he's one of those guys that he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll do everything other than the </v>

270
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

271
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:50.311
<v Speaker 2>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's everybody's psychology </v>

272
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:50.311
<v Speaker 2>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>

273
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they opened the door a tiny bit,</v>

274
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Tell Dan I need to open it all the </v>

275
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of stopped.</v>

276
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.510
<v Speaker 2>But then if you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of person yet,</v>

277
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 2>then don't open into tiny bits then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't.</v>

278
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:04.771
<v Speaker 2>But if you are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what the hell is wrong with </v>

279
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 2>enjoying a little bit if it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends person to person.</v>

280
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Some people can do it that other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go cold Turkey or they can't.</v>

281
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely,</v>

282
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:13.220
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

283
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just cool to see someone do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something positive always is because it </v>

284
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.471
<v Speaker 2>gives you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inspiration is a real fuel for human </v>

285
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:22.471
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

286
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:26.430
<v Speaker 2>When you see your friends or someone you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you like and they're doing </v>

287
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 2>something that's really transforming </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and helping them,</v>

288
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.240
<v Speaker 2>it fires you up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I felt sad,</v>

298

333
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.540
<v Speaker 2>these Ted Cruz motherfuckers are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a little victory under their </v>

334
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 2>belt and Iowa and they're doubling down </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Bible readings.</v>

335
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>That's scary to me.</v>

00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:43.001
<v Speaker 2>but that I probably come parked has gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far off band that is just downright </v>

338
00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

339
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 2>did you ever see that guy tweeted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote the other day from Barry Goldwater</v>

340
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>were barren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold water back in the fifties.</v>

341
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:54.311
<v Speaker 2>It recognize that there was an issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>with preachers and ministers in getting </v>

342
00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:55.880
<v Speaker 2>involved in the Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would ruin it.</v>

343
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary thing is that you'll go</v>

344
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.040
<v Speaker 2>back 50 years to the guys work when see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not Kansas back in the day and </v>

345
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 2>they would be considered moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrist today.</v>

346
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.460
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

347
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Barry Goldwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the reasonable voice.</v>

348
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:12.491
<v Speaker 2>He would always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the one that was warning against </v>

349
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:12.491
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

350
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:12.491
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

351
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:12.491
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

352
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:14.910
<v Speaker 2>he had some positions that were three </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

353
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.840
<v Speaker 2>but he will set a bunch of others that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were very,</v>

354
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 2>very reasonable the way it made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.240
<v Speaker 2>and today he will be seen as fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberality.</v>

356
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

357
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are strange times where it's the </v>

358
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of strange because this is the</v>

359
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.160
<v Speaker 2>most advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

360
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>as far as our ability to access </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

361
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:39.941
<v Speaker 2>It's never been like this before and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as our ability to access studies and</v>

362
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 2>find out the actual real scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts about certain things.</v>

363
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.750
<v Speaker 2>But this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more important now to profess a </v>

364
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 2>love or a belief in God when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>running for president,</v>

365
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than ever than ever.</v>

366
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.890
<v Speaker 2>You have to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody has to say it.</v>

367
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never been one sad guy who could</v>

368
00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:02.480
<v Speaker 2>just skirt the question and not discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

369
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:07.481
<v Speaker 2>You have to go in and believe what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe or not believe what I believe </v>

370
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 2>because I'm about to give you not want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that is like,</v>

371
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I thought I just stay away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political discussions because they are.</v>

372
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 2>There's no point in the weekend about </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point one sec when it becomes,</v>

373
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

374
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's just there's not even a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

375
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.360
<v Speaker 2>there's not even like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we had to eat our school and through </v>

376
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.360
<v Speaker 2>oversee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

377
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.240
<v Speaker 2>that can be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be interesting to hell.</v>

378
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 2>We can even let her for some stuff from </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

379
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:35.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's not even that point is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pure crazy extremist insults back and </v>

380
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.461
<v Speaker 2>forth and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as my all time favorite election </v>

381
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:39.461
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

382
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:42.020
<v Speaker 2>it's the stupidest yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the shittiest choices.</v>

383
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 2>The least inspired candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the best one for me.</v>

384
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 2>This is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing.</v>

385
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 2>He had a whole show going on about</v>

386
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 3>how happy he was that Donald trump was </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the race for the entertainment factor</v>

387
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.300
<v Speaker 3>that does it because he was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was making a good point because they </v>

388
00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.300
<v Speaker 3>say look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the primaries,</v>

389
00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.370
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Republican primaries,</v>

390
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 3>the game is you have to go zero point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One millimeter more conservative than </v>

391
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 3>the next guy when the primaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to go too far because</v>

392
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:12.321
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you lose the janitor of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecture and you have trampled steps in </v>

393
00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 3>and it goes like 20 yards past everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

394
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

395
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 3>if I don't follow you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lose the primary,</v>

396
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:19.010
<v Speaker 3>but if I follow him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done in the general.</v>

397
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 3>So that was having a blast with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was laughing.</v>

398
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Which episode is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a common sense or is either.</v>

399
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe after the first Republican debate,</v>

400
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what he was.</v>

401
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.220
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go listen to that throat.</v>

402
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

403
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

404
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump has nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

405
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he really wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

406
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think he does and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why he's so outrageous,</v>

407
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.530
<v Speaker 3>but I think along the way he's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked himself because this is what </v>

408
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.591
<v Speaker 3>people have been asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People for the longest time have wanted </v>

409
00:18:51.591 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 3>someone believe him or don't believe I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with him or don't agree with him.</v>

410
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:59.301
<v Speaker 3>He's speaking his mind right when he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying he's saying because he doesn't </v>

411
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no filter whatsoever.</v>

412
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

413
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:06.100
<v Speaker 3>someone's doing the raping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

414
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.480
<v Speaker 3>this guy's running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time for putting a wall up like </v>

415
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 3>some fucking Berlin Wall up between us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Mexico.</v>

416
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

417
00:19:15.991 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems reasonable.</v>

418
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to let Railo that over the </v>

419
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.130
<v Speaker 3>rapists one does.</v>

420
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.980
<v Speaker 3>There's no represent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

421
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 3>someone's doing the raping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's doing the raping here.</v>

422
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was half of the sixth grade.</v>

423
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:37.461
<v Speaker 3>You can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can check like maybe a non on site </v>

424
00:19:37.461 --> 00:19:37.461
<v Speaker 3>or it's hard to keep track of which was </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

425
00:19:37.461 --> 00:19:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Odl was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

426
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
<v Speaker 3>because they are so similar that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>wide where they asked him something </v>

427
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 3>about what does it take to make a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make America great again.</v>

428
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Adhere had through this whole speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's clearly not answered.</v>

429
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said running around just throwaway </v>

430
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:55.900
<v Speaker 3>toward salad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That had nothing to do with the question</v>

431
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 3>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tends with him going like,</v>

432
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at the police turned up.</v>

433
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:01.750
<v Speaker 3>That's an awesome at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this.</v>

434
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I've got to leave with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>question because I don't want to deal </v>

435
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.321
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look at the guy with the </v>

436
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:09.321
<v Speaker 3>announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

437
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:09.321
<v Speaker 3>well he's a good medium man.</v>

438
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 3>He's very good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing interviews for years and</v>

439
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.090
<v Speaker 3>he's also been on that reality show for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time.</v>

440
00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:21.091
<v Speaker 3>You got fired from it while running for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this election because of the </v>

441
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said about Mexicans though.</v>

442
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:27.861
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I agree with you and this is </v>

443
00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:28.470
<v Speaker 3>entertaining it past the point of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point that it's entertaining.</v>

444
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.500
<v Speaker 3>That's why I would dig a agenda that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean tramping sanders because at that </v>

445
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>point teacher so wild and weird that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's enjoyable.</v>

446
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 3>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

447
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.990
<v Speaker 3>the professional guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they measure every single statement,</v>

448
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

449
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:44.350
<v Speaker 3>the politically internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

450
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can write or the radio every single,</v>

451
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.970
<v Speaker 3>you know already</v>

452
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.900
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

453
00:20:48.901 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>It's with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

454
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea what the hell is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come out of their mouth.</v>

455
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It's makes it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

456
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 2>at least I got to watch something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't put me to sleep there.</v>

457
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talking about putting me to </v>

458
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.130
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton puts me to sleep because</v>

459
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing inspiring about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's saying.</v>

460
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Nothing inspiring about her presence or </v>
<v Speaker 2>her speeches,</v>

461
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.470

<v Speaker 2>my seven year old daughter said it best.</v>

462
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:16.471

<v Speaker 2>I would vote for her because she's a </v>

463
00:21:16.471 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people feel like that.</v>

464
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

465
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:18.270
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

466
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a black man.</v>

467
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a white girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

468
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 2>But it's like maybe you can pick some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jesus just who's better?</v>

471
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Warren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine.</v>

472
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 2>She's not in anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

473
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she dropped out,</v>

474
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.320
<v Speaker 2>but when she was running they found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she wasn't really native American </v>

475
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.541
<v Speaker 2>and she tried to fake that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a scholarship or something for </v>

476
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what he was the,</v>

477
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 2>the drop down the hall of fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing you can't fake.</v>

478
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 2>You can fake like you're one eighth </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swedish.</v>

479
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.550
<v Speaker 2>They will give you a hard time about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you say you one eighth,</v>

480
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.360
<v Speaker 2>native American and Torres on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>noble and mystical and you have like </v>

482
00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:04.120
<v Speaker 2>magic fucking eagle power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can hear like a wolf that if you </v>

483
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 2>watch all the 19 sixties movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like Batty Indians will come </v>

484
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 2>into sculpture and chop your head off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

485
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Because they already know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows why.</v>

486
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:13.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like the dragon in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

487
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Pulse 19 sixties is old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hug the furry creatures of the forest.</v>

488
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:20.410

<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

489
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.160
<v Speaker 2>It was the guy in the commercial that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cried when he saw the ground,</v>

490
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.760
<v Speaker 2>the garbage on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

491

<v Speaker 2>but we from the sixties on,</v>

494
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:42.961
<v Speaker 2>we've sort of associated native </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans like spiritual things like </v>

495
00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:46.120
<v Speaker 2>dream catchers and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is a Guinea.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could all go to Bonnie fuel.</v>

509
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't cry too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about keep America beautiful.</v>

510
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it definitely shouldn't be like </v>

511
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 2>hanging out by the highway either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

512
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just standing there was moccasins on and</v>

513
00:23:41.571 --> 00:23:42.770
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

514
00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:47.771
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but native Americans from like that </v>

515
00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:50.681
<v Speaker 2>point on where they're associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sweat lodge is pod ceremonies and</v>

516
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 2>spiritual things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these ideas.</v>

517
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these ideas of native </v>

518
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.291
<v Speaker 2>Americans that they lived off the land </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they used every last piece of the </v>

519
00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 2>animal and they had a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to their surroundings,</v>

520
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

521
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 2>a lot of is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of truth in that,</v>

522
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's the problem with stereotypes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

523
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.210
<v Speaker 2>You take 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's partially true,</v>

524
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.680
<v Speaker 2>and then you blow it up the entirety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience,</v>

525
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 2>so torn with the carrier at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very far from debbie out of the deal.</v>

526
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Well my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven Rinella,</v>

527
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 2>the host of the mediator has the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories of native Americans.</v>

528
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:31.151
<v Speaker 2>He has a deep knowledge of the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of native Americans and he's got some </v>

529
00:24:31.151 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 2>fantastic stories about the Nez perce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

530
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.090
<v Speaker 2>they were fucking cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

531
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:40.910
<v Speaker 2>That was super common to not only attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighboring tribes,</v>

532
00:24:40.911 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 2>but to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat their babies,</v>

533
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.680
<v Speaker 2>eat their family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

534
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.960
<v Speaker 2>eat them rail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.050
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of cannibalism going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old west,</v>

536
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 2>especially apparently amongst the Great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lakes area in the Great Lakes area.</v>

537
00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

538
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Is it just because it's called know </v>
<v Speaker 2>different people?</v>

539
00:24:57.141 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the culture.</v>

540
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's hard to generalize with </v>

541
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 2>distinctions among native stuff is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much difference.</v>

542
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys put on them to Great Lakes have</v>

543
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.940
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with the guys from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plains to do with.</v>

544
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.330
<v Speaker 2>So each one is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

545
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A plague stuff is pretty intense.</v>

546
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 2>The fire that I liked the most about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is on you will,</v>

547
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:16.850
<v Speaker 2>would go out to get captives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:25:16.851 --> 00:25:21.851
<v Speaker 2>you will go on at wateraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get copies this and once you see </v>

549
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:21.851
<v Speaker 2>you get captured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have one of two options.</v>

550
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:25.040
<v Speaker 2>If they like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they adopt you as a family member.</v>

551
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 2>You replace one of their dead family </v>
<v Speaker 2>members so you get treated that way.</v>

552
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.790
<v Speaker 2>You are love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like you so much.</v>

553
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Then they torture you through that over </v>
<v Speaker 2>a four day period.</v>

554
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

555
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.820
<v Speaker 2>it's blitzing skydeck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of a flip of a coin data,</v>

556
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 2>which I guess are lyrically clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony was a good thing,</v>

557
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but for everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much.</v>

558
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me the story of this one guy got</v>

559
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 2>captured.</v>

560
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 2>There was two guys captured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Guy,</v>

561
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.580
<v Speaker 2>they killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed him in front of his friend,</v>

562
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:57.910
<v Speaker 2>and then they told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they might've aid them in front </v>

563
00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 2>of his friend too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed them and then they told him,</v>

564
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 2>we're going to take off all your </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>

565
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 2>We're going to let you run and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get away you can live.</v>

566
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.560
<v Speaker 2>And so this mother ran like the wind </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped in the freezing cold river and </v>

567
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.690
<v Speaker 2>hidden a beaver dam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

568
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>He got smart enough to climb up into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beaver dam,</v>

569
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:16.871
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is a risk and a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>half because what if it climb in there </v>

570
00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:18.380
<v Speaker 2>and the beavers in there that beavers </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna fuck you up.</v>

571
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.530
<v Speaker 2>People have died from before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If beaver bites your artery leader or </v>

572
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 2>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shoot the retreat.</v>

573
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.260
<v Speaker 2>That will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

574
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.450
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucking made it and he walked for </v>

<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

691
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 2>the continent of Africa is similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the continent of North America,</v>

692
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this sick Jesus Christ twice the</v>

693
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 2>size of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

694
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 2>that is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

695
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Alaska is larger than all but 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereign countries.</v>

696
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how big it is when you put it in </v>

697
00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 2>the middle of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freaky fucking a man.</v>

698
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:04.770
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge and it's so lightly populated.</v>

699
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it up there.</v>

700
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 2>I got to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time?</v>

701
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ari Shaffir and I did a anchorage.</v>

702
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 2>We did a comedy show up there and went </v>
<v Speaker 2>salmon fishing.</v>

703
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Saw some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw my first movie I ever saw some </v>

704
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.160
<v Speaker 2>eagles for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was awesome.</v>

705
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he told me that they were pretty </v>

706
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

707
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

708
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange when you look in a wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>eagle in the eye,</v>

709
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's kind of far away and </v>

710
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:35.730
<v Speaker 2>they don't let you get that close to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

711
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.971
<v Speaker 2>but when you're passing by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were on a boat and we're passing by </v>

712
00:32:38.971 --> 00:32:38.971
<v Speaker 2>these trees and there's an eagle up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tree and you're like,</v>

713
00:32:38.971 --> 00:32:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

714
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I big fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

715
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 2>They don't get hunted by people either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not afraid of people,</v>

716
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not stupid either,</v>

717
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.920
<v Speaker 2>but that places a legitimately wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in that when you get out of your </v>

718
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to run to where you're going.</v>

719
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to get swarmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>mosquitoes that.</v>

720
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I heard about.</v>

721
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the part that I didn't like about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska.</v>

722
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I call it sound awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I heard about the level of </v>

723
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intensity is mosquito wise.</v>

724
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

725
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Ari and I were laughing.</v>

726
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't even believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

727
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like open up the car door.</v>

728
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your boots on and just the time it </v>

729
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.751
<v Speaker 2>takes to open the door and get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>boots on the car is filled with </v>

730
00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 2>mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hundreds of mosquitoes,</v>

731
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Speaker 2>like a swarm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find you instantly.</v>

732
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 2>What's about to climb out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracts mosquitoes so much?</v>

733
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just fucking desperado </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know they're only gonna be </v>

734
00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 2>alive for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's like three humans to buy it </v>

736
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.060
<v Speaker 2>and sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

737
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

738
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 2>do they bite other animals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

739
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just don't think that they have </v>

740
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 2>much time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they only stay alive for a short</v>

741
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:53.300
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so while they're at it,</v>

742
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 2>they're addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they are berserker mosquitoes.</v>

743
00:33:55.611 --> 00:33:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Just going for it then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

744
00:33:58.011 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a scary fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuel have.</v>

745
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More so than Florida.</v>

746
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.610
<v Speaker 2>You would think like Florida mosquitoes </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the most rabid.</v>

747
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>That's how you figure tropical place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of humidity.</v>

748
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 2>All of the Florida people though they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat and lazy.</v>

749
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.170
<v Speaker 2>They could get these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

750
00:34:14.171 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be another tourist.</v>

751
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to chase these one.</v>

752
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida has its own problems though,</v>

753
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.390
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida is.</v>

754
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.460
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing a big python hunt now </v>

755
00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.200
<v Speaker 2>because so many people have released </v>
<v Speaker 2>pythons in Florida that they,</v>

756
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:34.300
<v Speaker 2>they've bred and overread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have like a gigantic python </v>

757
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.861
<v Speaker 2>invasion problem to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're offering rewards for people to </v>

758
00:34:38.861 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 2>kill Python's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The headlines that come out of Florida,</v>

759
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that are at constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone source of entertainment,</v>

<v Speaker 2>similar where they were chasing this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a stolen car.</v>

777
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.520
<v Speaker 2>The guy gets to a bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumps off the bridge and immediately </v>

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.870

<v Speaker 2>like literally jumped on an alligator.</v>

<v Speaker 2>crocodiles,</v>

784
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 2>which coincidentally have also been </v>
<v Speaker 2>released in the everglades.</v>

00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless it goes on further.</v>

806
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:55.701
<v Speaker 2>I don't know though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't totally aware of the entire </v>

807
00:36:55.701 --> 00:36:59.811
<v Speaker 2>story of Escobar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knew that he was a drug dealer </v>

808
00:36:59.811 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

809
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.930
<v Speaker 2>those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

810
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.760
<v Speaker 2>it's so well done to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

811
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

812
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

813
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 2>that's on my watch list because I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>done it.</v>

814
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Every single person I talked to told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell someone that one insane he went </v>

815
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:20.631
<v Speaker 2>to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't really want to tell </v>

816
00:37:20.631 --> 00:37:22.431
<v Speaker 2>anybody anything about it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shocking and it builds up really</v>

817
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:27.441
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it really builds up well from the </v>

818
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:30.450
<v Speaker 2>early days of his drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just finding out about drugs to the end.</v>

819
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's what's funny about it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people got old like,</v>

820
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.480
<v Speaker 2>oh the Kadima now the mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you look at like mafia </v>

821
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.530
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are identical to the history of any</v>

822
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:41.970
<v Speaker 2>state or if any nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

823
00:37:41.971 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the dynamics that are.</v>

824
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you know wine is in a suit and tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one is with the AK 47,</v>

825
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.430
<v Speaker 2>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bezirk seeing.</v>

826
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a struggle for power.</v>

827
00:37:50.821 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a game off fuck over your enemies </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheets.</v>

828
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 2>The other one who can get you do what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can expand your.</v>

829
00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:02.310
<v Speaker 2>It's the same story over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're talking about that </v>

830
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.940
<v Speaker 2>extended to great or fabulous go buyer </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not that different.</v>

831
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Really know the specifics are slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

832
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 2>but the big picture is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a struggle for power.</v>

833
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:14.181
<v Speaker 2>End of story and it seems like when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the really high levels of finance</v>

834
00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:19.941
<v Speaker 2>and of volume and the amount of troops </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the amount of people that you're </v>

835
00:38:19.941 --> 00:38:23.811
<v Speaker 2>controlling the area control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when the real trostle he's </v>

836
00:38:23.811 --> 00:38:26.580
<v Speaker 2>kicking like you almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost a universal that horrific </v>

837
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:32.331
<v Speaker 2>acts get done to intimidate your enemy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to make sure that you retain control</v>

838
00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>over certain certain areas.</v>

839
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to sing.</v>

840
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:42.481
<v Speaker 3>Where is like in that sense you might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>History's really kind of fucked up and </v>

841
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 3>weird when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you approach it with them through a </v>

842
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.671
<v Speaker 3>moral lens because you see so many nasty</v>
<v Speaker 3>things take place and in the weird ones </v>

843
00:38:50.671 --> 00:38:54.871
<v Speaker 3>are the ones who were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There really is no good solution where </v>

844
00:38:54.871 --> 00:38:54.871
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what the healthy thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like.</v>

845
00:38:54.871 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 3>There's one that I was researching for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>history on fire maybe a year from now or</v>

846
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:03.601
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was searching distorted from the 19 </v>

847
00:39:03.601 --> 00:39:06.250
<v Speaker 3>eighties in El Salvador.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that time there was a a right wing </v>

848
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:10.651
<v Speaker 3>government in El Salvador to the US </v>
<v Speaker 3>government was supporting and there was </v>

849
00:39:10.651 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 3>a leftist gallery are there was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>logic of the cold war.</v>

850
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:14.020
<v Speaker 3>There are only two options here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either protocol,</v>

851
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Muni story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our pro us.</v>

852
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.750
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

853
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.920
<v Speaker 3>So in the process of fighting these </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftist Galleria,</v>

854
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.940
<v Speaker 3>the government of El Salvador is doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty things right to anybody will </v>

855
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.291
<v Speaker 3>criticize them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter whether they're a </v>

856
00:39:28.291 --> 00:39:28.291
<v Speaker 3>communist or not.</v>

857
00:39:28.291 --> 00:39:30.860
<v Speaker 3>To get tortured that chop off their </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies will leave them in the middle of </v>

858
00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.441
<v Speaker 3>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American Congress at that point because </v>

859
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:34.441
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

860
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:38.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can really keep sending millions of </v>

861
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.130
<v Speaker 3>dollars to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys were doing horrible human </v>

862
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.291
<v Speaker 3>rights violations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they pass this law that in order for </v>

863
00:39:43.291 --> 00:39:45.340
<v Speaker 3>any more aid to be sent to the governor </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the sound of other,</v>

864
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.640
<v Speaker 3>the president of the United States has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sign off on a document stating that </v>

865
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.540
<v Speaker 3>these guys have made huge improvements </v>
<v Speaker 3>in their human rights record,</v>

866
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.300
<v Speaker 3>that they are on the right path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it's getting better.</v>

867
00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Problem is the deadline is coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a gun is each and to be able to </v>

868
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.401
<v Speaker 3>send out all these millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the government of itself rather and </v>

869
00:40:05.401 --> 00:40:09.350
<v Speaker 3>in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Salvadorian army on these offensive </v>

870
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.151
<v Speaker 3>against the gallery and they find some </v>
<v Speaker 3>villages that just wanted to be left the</v>

871
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 3>fuck alone.</v>

872
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 3>They were not pro communist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are not anticommunist theater.</v>

873
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 3>They were like bunch of Evangelical </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians,</v>

874
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:22.150
<v Speaker 3>peasants who just wanted to farm their </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields and be left alone so he.</v>

875
00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 3>They will lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The communists go through.</v>

876
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 3>They will let the army go through to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure if we stay neutral.</v>

877
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Everything works out right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

878
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 3>not in the Cold War and the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no neutrality are either on one</v>

879
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:34.390
<v Speaker 3>side or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Salvadorian army come in,</v>

880
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 3>grab every single villagers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>separate the men from the women,</v>

881
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 3>kilos demand or April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The women don't kill them all,</v>

882
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 3>kill everybody in that village and New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York Times.</v>

883
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.070
<v Speaker 3>The New York Times did an article on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm now.</v>

884
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Reagan was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

885
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 3>what do I do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>

886
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.580
<v Speaker 3>the guy who wrote this article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it some crazy communist.</v>

887
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.610
<v Speaker 3>None of these is through is a smear </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign against our allies.</v>

888
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.400
<v Speaker 3>The government has made huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvements.</v>

889
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm sending that millions of dollars of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course years down the road and saw that </v>

890
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.291
<v Speaker 3>the original story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was through that the staff did that </v>

891
00:41:09.291 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 3>happen and the but other than bitching </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Reagan,</v>

892
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:15.721
<v Speaker 3>this is not even an anti Reagan thing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's a messy situation because you </v>

893
00:41:15.721 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 3>do support the government of Assad </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>

894
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 3>You're literally supporting death </v>
<v Speaker 3>squads.</v>

895
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Child rapists mean it doesn't really get</v>
<v Speaker 3>any worse than that.</v>

896
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't support them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a chance that hillside rather </v>

897
00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 3>who turn into a communist state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case he's not exactly like </v>

898
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 3>communism around the world is a higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>reputational for human rights.</v>

899
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

900
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you choice here?</v>

901
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the you choose to support them or do you</v>

902
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:41.340
<v Speaker 3>choose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

903
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:46.720
<v Speaker 3>how do you see what I'm going like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a situation where no matter what </v>

904
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:46.720
<v Speaker 3>you choose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

905
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.550
<v Speaker 3>You're doing bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But clearly the moment our support in </v>

906
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 3>death squads that can not be the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution,</v>

907
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the right solution?</v>

908
00:41:57.711 --> 00:42:00.250
<v Speaker 3>What is the good thing you should do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

909
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 3>character at the same exact problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

910
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Right before Reagan Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guide,</v>

911
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 3>the Archbishop of El Salvador,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

912
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:11.561
<v Speaker 3>Oscar Romero sent him a letter saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop fucking sending money to my </v>

913
00:42:11.561 --> 00:42:13.840
<v Speaker 3>government because they are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible things with it cart.</v>

914
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

915
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to look at this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is politically traveling for me.</v>

916
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.630
<v Speaker 3>So two weeks later that squats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking into the main church and outside</v>

917
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.770
<v Speaker 3>of authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy was celebrating mass.</v>

918
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 3>They gunned him down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed him,</v>

919
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.300
<v Speaker 3>so he's not a Republican or democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

920
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like both sides of the game.</v>

921
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:36.311
<v Speaker 3>They are did not know how to handle this</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a situation where it's like which </v>

922
00:42:36.311 --> 00:42:40.840
<v Speaker 3>mass murderers and we support and which </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones do we oppose because that's the </v>

923
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.381
<v Speaker 3>reality of it was like those are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories or like what the fuck do you do?</v>

924
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.510
<v Speaker 3>What is the right thing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Windows case,</v>

925
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 3>there almost is no right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

926
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:54.730
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're dealing with certain parts </v>

927
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.771
<v Speaker 3>of the world that have been embattled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been just in inter tangled in </v>

928
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 3>these horrible bitter feuds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rivalries.</v>

929
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Horrible things get done and war and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with two horrible </v>

930
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.361
<v Speaker 3>groups and you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiate substantially one being </v>

931
00:43:10.361 --> 00:43:15.281
<v Speaker 3>more moral or ethical that over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one and oftentimes like if you </v>

932
00:43:15.281 --> 00:43:19.481
<v Speaker 3>were more and more or more ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't survive in those terrible </v>

933
00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 3>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to do horrible things just</v>

934
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:24.750
<v Speaker 3>in order to stay above water and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what keeps it.</v>

935
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.890
<v Speaker 3>The stories keep you on your toes </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you condemned wine and not </v>

936
00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:29.890
<v Speaker 3>the other yarn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paypal credit,</v>

937
00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:30.540
<v Speaker 3>if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the other,</v>

938
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 3>the first year and a booklet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we get even to what we are seeing,</v>

939
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:34.850
<v Speaker 3>which is the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

940
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

941
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:37.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucked up situation and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do terrible things.</v>

942
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 3>If you say too easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

943
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

944
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:42.770
<v Speaker 3>so go chop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids had had off no big deal.</v>

945
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:45.230
<v Speaker 3>So you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say Baylor,</v>

946
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:50.300
<v Speaker 3>so safe to say the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a weird dynamic there </v>

947
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.310
<v Speaker 3>where there's no real place where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel comfortable.</v>

948
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

949
00:43:52.941 --> 00:43:55.520
<v Speaker 3>that was the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can glad we made the right call.</v>

950
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Now I can go through easy and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

951
00:43:57.951 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you this because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit historian.</v>

952
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Was there ever a time in human history </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there was like a noble ethical </v>

953
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.370
<v Speaker 3>government of any sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

954
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.450
<v Speaker 3>an empire or country that didn't engage </v>
<v Speaker 3>in any human rights and did the right </v>

955
00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:18.341
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like was there a utopian government and </v>

956
00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:18.341
<v Speaker 3>anytime in history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

957
00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees of fucking up.</v>

958
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Some degrees they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

959
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 3>that's not that bad.</v>

960
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can.</v>

961
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.070
<v Speaker 3>We can live with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can live with.</v>

962
00:44:25.071 --> 00:44:30.071
<v Speaker 3>That does not mean it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still kind of Shitty is just a lot </v>

963
00:44:30.071 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 3>less shitty than the alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of modern times.</v>

964
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.440
<v Speaker 3>What's the most Utopian version of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>government that ever sort of ran?</v>

965
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I think what you get is in you do around</v>
<v Speaker 3>into society.</v>

966
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Swear may be like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have low population,</v>

967
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 3>vancity hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that are,</v>

968
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:50.841
<v Speaker 3>but the keyword being low population </v>
<v Speaker 3>density because once you have too many </v>

969
00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:53.901
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they compete for hunting grounds and </v>

970
00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:55.761
<v Speaker 3>they do horrible things to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a relatively low </v>

971
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 3>population density,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>

972
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.400
<v Speaker 3>there's really no reason to go to war </v>
<v Speaker 3>with another tribe over wealth because </v>

973
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.521
<v Speaker 3>they are nomadic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to fucking carry it on your </v>

974
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:05.521
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want.</v>

975
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:05.521
<v Speaker 3>I don't want your shit.</v>

976
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 3>They have to carry it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the work,</v>

977
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:08.720
<v Speaker 3>so you don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't fight over weld.</v>

978
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:13.790
<v Speaker 3>You don't fight over religion because </v>
<v Speaker 3>most of these guys have have kind of </v>

979
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.180
<v Speaker 3>inclusive approach where whatever you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that works good for you.</v>

980
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:19.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no competition there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have removed two huge things that</v>

981
00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:21.600
<v Speaker 3>people do nasty things to each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

982
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 3>They're still fighting over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hunting grounds.</v>

983
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 3>They're still fighting over women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that will still happen,</v>

984
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 3>but so it's not an idea like utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

985
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:35.450
<v Speaker 3>those noble hunters and gatherers who </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do no wrong.</v>

986
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did horrible things to each other.</v>

987
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:41.560
<v Speaker 3>They just have less reasons to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then later societies,</v>

988
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 3>so agriculture in cities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilizations,</v>

989
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.820
<v Speaker 3>that's when things started getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>really rough.</v>

990
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

991
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:53.421
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the placenta mine Australian </v>

992
00:45:53.421 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 3>glasses because you stay in one place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can accumulate wealth.</v>

993
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't have to carry every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>human on my back.</v>

994
00:45:56.731 --> 00:45:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Every few days I can sit in one place in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coma late.</v>

995
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do start seeing the growth of social</v>

996
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 3>class as you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start seeing.</v>

997
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hunters and gatherers.</v>

998
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't have reach hunter and gather </v>
<v Speaker 3>under poor line.</v>

999
00:46:06.691 --> 00:46:08.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's kind of on the same game.</v>

1000
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.940
<v Speaker 3>When you become sedentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can accumulate wealth and so you do </v>

1001
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 3>start seeing these game played out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the good way.</v>

1002
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have the resources to </v>

1003
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.311
<v Speaker 3>dedicate themselves to staff other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>working for a living and so on and in a </v>

1004
00:46:22.311 --> 00:46:27.021
<v Speaker 3>horrible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We told the nastiness that take place </v>

1005
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:29.511
<v Speaker 3>over the fighting over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want your shade is a little terrier </v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1007
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why to me,</v>

1008
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.420
<v Speaker 3>when you read those and as usual with </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

1009
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:39.030
<v Speaker 3>there's always a good and bad kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>logic is you have.</v>

1010
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Speaker 3>The guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was a horrible,</v>

1013

<v Speaker 3>harsh life where it was terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every and how can I call it?</v>

1015
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 3>There's an element of truth to that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also an element that's not and </v>

1016
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 3>vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like up to a point,</v>

1019
00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:02.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even both scenarios,</v>

1020
00:47:02.311 --> 00:47:05.780
<v Speaker 3>there are some huge advantages in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge these advantages.</v>

1021
00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:07.740
<v Speaker 3>He just that they change which ones they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1022
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get so much wealth and so much </v>

1023
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.660
<v Speaker 3>prosperity that you start getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>royalty when you start getting people </v>

1024
00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.630
<v Speaker 3>that accumulate massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth and then they have this </v>

1025
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.071
<v Speaker 3>incredible ability to control all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around them and everyone's </v>

1026
00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:28.371
<v Speaker 3>fearful of them because they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate power that can have you killed </v>

1027
00:47:28.371 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 3>instantly and face no repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading</v>

1028
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:35.250
<v Speaker 2>this article about this guy who is some </v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle Eastern print and he was living </v>

1029
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:38.180
<v Speaker 2>in Beverly Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about this guy and you want</v>

1030
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.840
<v Speaker 2>to do sexually assaulting people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked for him and they arrested him and</v>

1031
00:47:42.841 --> 00:47:45.620
<v Speaker 2>then he fled the country that we gotta </v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1187
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.440

1188
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:10.270
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't all that.</v>

1190
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

1191
00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.620
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't realize what it was when</v>

1192
00:55:16.621 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 4>it first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it hadn't really changed.</v>

1193
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Was the first episode of the Sopranos.</v>

1194
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.850
<v Speaker 4>It was a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

1195
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1196
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:25.120
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are way.</v>

1197
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:30.140
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of comedic element for </v>

1198
00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:31.911
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when the woman had the machine gun </v>

1199
00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.670
<v Speaker 4>and she ran outside with the AK 47,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wife like that was so out of </v>

1200
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:36.300
<v Speaker 4>character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like who she became later in the show.</v>

1201
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 4>Like that episode was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was preposterous.</v>

1202
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Gang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

1203
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mom,</v>

1204
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

1205
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.180
<v Speaker 4>But even though they have some moments </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there,</v>

1206
00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 4>like I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even at the end of season one where they</v>

1207
00:55:46.891 --> 00:55:51.891
<v Speaker 4>are chasing these do through the woods </v>
<v Speaker 4>to shoot him and the dude is like </v>

1208
00:55:51.891 --> 00:55:51.891
<v Speaker 4>screaming all of a sudden one and </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely he's like,</v>

1209
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:52.800
<v Speaker 4>you got shot that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1210
00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:55.090
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck poison ivy at his old piece of golf</v>

1211
00:55:55.110 --> 00:56:00.110
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like they throw in these weird </v>

1212
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:00.110
<v Speaker 4>data bits to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1213
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really well or eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.360
<v Speaker 4>It was definitely really well written </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it got better as it got darker and </v>

1215
00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 4>weirder got better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the few shows ever where</v>

1216
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:14.030
<v Speaker 4>they figured out a way for you to feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>sympathetic about a murderer because </v>

1217
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Tony Soprano wasn't a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He killed him.</v>

1218
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:18.260
<v Speaker 4>You liked him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1219
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Should I even add the height?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember having nightmare self shit.</v>

1220
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>The FBI trying to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1221
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>have to hide the stuff I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you relate to the guy.</v>

1222
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.940
<v Speaker 2>At least I did feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it's a fucking exited </v>

1223
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 2>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your last name as well.</v>

1224
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.200
<v Speaker 2>But it was a dark time for Italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>

1225
00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:43.150
<v Speaker 2>So because everybody wanted to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to the mob was really dumb.</v>

1226
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 2>East Coast Guineas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

1227
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:48.290

<v Speaker 2>older Guinness.</v>

1228
00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 2>That's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would crank it up to a 10 guy with </v>

1229
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.420
<v Speaker 2>the thing and the goes like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>real housewives.</v>

1234
00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Real housewives of Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should just give them knives.</v>

1235
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 2>They just give those bitches knives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let them cut each other.</v>

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 2>mafia stuff came up as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1261
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when like in the south,</v>

1262
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:15.270
<v Speaker 2>they're neat that he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God invaded by dishpan yards by the </v>

1263
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:17.660
<v Speaker 2>French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the government was not on the </v>

1264
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:17.660
<v Speaker 2>people's side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were a occupying force,</v>

1265
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 2>trying to squeeze as much wealth out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country as possible.</v>

1266
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.260
<v Speaker 2>So because they couldn't turn to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

1267
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the people started turning into</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1268
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.700
<v Speaker 2>made up local organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which eventually,</v>

1269
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 2>because they provide all these services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are also the mafia,</v>

1270
00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:36.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do instill deal with teaching </v>

1271
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the logic why besides </v>

1272
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:39.190
<v Speaker 2>academia now that element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 90 devolves completely into Jessica.</v>

1273
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:40.990
<v Speaker 2>You mean apply them into nothing goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's like,</v>

1274
00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.400
<v Speaker 2>there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:45.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a logic to it and it's immediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus state university level,</v>

1276
00:58:45.851 --> 00:58:50.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy of the way they handle </v>

1277
00:58:50.851 --> 00:58:50.851
<v Speaker 2>these nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1278
00:58:50.851 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing gives me an alert on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1279
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the amount of </v>

1280
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Speaker 2>atrocities committed per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably pretty similar.</v>

1281
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean the mafia does some awful shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1282
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.610
<v Speaker 2>So government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1283
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:07.100
<v Speaker 2>So does the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean think about the amount of </v>

1284
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:10.560
<v Speaker 2>innocent people that are accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed everyday during military.</v>

1285
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:16.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you need to be a war to call </v>

1286
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 2>and quit or worse or the mafia bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why those stories are the same </v>

1287
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:23.131
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the guy struggling for power </v>

1288
00:59:23.131 --> 00:59:23.131
<v Speaker 2>against 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

1289
00:59:23.131 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 3>the same thing over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1290
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:25.250
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1291
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:30.251
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mafia has its ancient system of </v>

1292
00:59:30.251 --> 00:59:31.100
<v Speaker 3>government and laws and rules and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1293
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:36.190
<v Speaker 3>so to the sandinistas the contras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does you know the so did you can go </v>

1294
00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 3>down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to gangas conduit.</v>

1295
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.200
<v Speaker 3>So did Alexander the Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all had their own sort of systems </v>

1296
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 3>of government and rules that you had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live by.</v>

1297
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:48.630
<v Speaker 3>And speaking of getting gas gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you check out the show Marco Polo?</v>

1298
00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

1299
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good show.</v>

1300
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't finish it and they hate it,</v>

1301
00:59:53.391 --> 00:59:56.290
<v Speaker 3>but equal that I know they did like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half hour on the bad ass.</v>

1302
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:57.720
<v Speaker 3>That waste among.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1304
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Doug?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's well written.</v>

1305
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good stuff.</v>

1306
01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a very expensive show apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said yeah,</v>

1307
01:00:04.581 --> 01:00:09.581
<v Speaker 3>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sets are massive and they make it </v>

1308
01:00:09.581 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 3>look like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mongol era,</v>

1309
01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:12.690
<v Speaker 3>like 1200.</v>

1310
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:17.700
<v Speaker 3>So they don't kind of sell it for money </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know what kind of stuff for </v>

1311
01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.951
<v Speaker 3>money to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My probably my favorite tool for the </v>

1312
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:20.951
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that Oma?</v>

1313
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Be One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1314
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.220
<v Speaker 3>That was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't really an amazing,</v>

1315
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 3>brilliant instruction at trait bits </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1316
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was back when was it 2004 or five,</v>

1317
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 3>something like that wasn't that long </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1318
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 3>It was a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they only did two seasons,</v>

1319
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:41.150
<v Speaker 3>but they are fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I watched every season twice,</v>

1320
01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 3>so maybe even more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that good.</v>

1321
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.820
<v Speaker 3>The main character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1322
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:50.330
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty much a variational call and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's so cool.</v>

1323
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oddly enough,</v>

1324
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.980
<v Speaker 3>the guy who created the show was Jamil </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lewis was the guy with directed the </v>

1325
01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.521
<v Speaker 3>first call and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy was behind a part of the </v>

1326
01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:00.650
<v Speaker 3>creative directing of the early UFC.</v>

1327
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who wrote the apocalypse </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1328
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.280
<v Speaker 3>He standing so many of the sinks side </v>
<v Speaker 3>dig and by.</v>

1329
01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your money if you have never seen</v>

1330
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:09.560
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check it out.</v>

1331
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:14.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean today looks tame by comparison </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause so much stuff has been done </v>

1332
01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.710
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just dates a 10 notice before the</v>

1333
01:01:16.711 --> 01:01:21.711
<v Speaker 3>time he was over 18 times with nudity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and violence and the grittiness of it </v>

1334
01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:22.520
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

1335
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.610
<v Speaker 3>it's an awesome trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of opened the door maybe for </v>

1336
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:27.610
<v Speaker 3>things like game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bake time,</v>

1337
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:27.990
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>

1338
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.170
<v Speaker 3>That's funny how a show like that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch on,</v>

1339
01:01:30.171 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 3>but a show like game of thrones does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1340
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:36.911
<v Speaker 3>or soprano's does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what he was is it almost </v>

1341
01:01:36.911 --> 01:01:38.300
<v Speaker 3>actually doing fairly well but not well </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough for the budget.</v>

1342
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I think the budget was too inflated </v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to the results.</v>

1343
01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 3>The results are good.</v>

1344
01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people liked it.</v>

1345
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:46.670
<v Speaker 3>The critical reviews or to create an </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience you know is good,</v>

1346
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.600
<v Speaker 3>but you know the Sopranos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shoot somebody silos,</v>

1347
01:01:49.601 --> 01:01:52.130
<v Speaker 3>you know the budget is not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you have to recreate.</v>

1348
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Ancient Rome when I could and scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of game right </v>

1349
01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Hbo,</v>

1350
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I think he wasn't that old tanking is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this show is doing well,</v>

1351
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:05.471
<v Speaker 3>but it cost too much fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those shows they didn't have the option </v>

1352
01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 3>of selling them on itunes back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they know exactly what 2004?</v>

1353
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Did they have itunes back then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kinda did.</v>

1354
01:02:11.391 --> 01:02:16.391
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say that even dad would have </v>

1355
01:02:16.391 --> 01:02:18.050
<v Speaker 3>been said much the early stages that </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that crazy fucking 10 years ago.</v>

1356
01:02:18.051 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's another universe completely.</v>

1357
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 4>It might as well be with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with social media,</v>

1358
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:23.630
<v Speaker 4>with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another,</v>

1359
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 4>a whole nother universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many podcasts were around back then?</v>

1360
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.480
<v Speaker 4>Was there like a few people's 30 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>with data,</v>

1361
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 4>but nothing got a big scale yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably something.</v>

1362
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 4>There's probably something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This podcast has been around since,</v>

1363
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for six years.</v>

1364
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 4>So since 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nine slash nine.</v>

1365
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:49.551
<v Speaker 4>10 somewhere around then I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we do and we were doing it in </v>

1366
01:02:49.551 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 4>December of 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so right before 2010.</v>

1367
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure when you started podcasting,</v>

1368
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Ward was a fraction of what it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1369
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:57.960
<v Speaker 4>it was real small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1370
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam Carolla had one.</v>

1371
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was a few other ones.</v>

1372
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam Curry had one of the first ones and</v>

1373
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:09.220
<v Speaker 4>John Devork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1374
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know about them.</v>

1375
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I didn't download them back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the inspiration to do mine from </v>

1376
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:20.510
<v Speaker 4>Anthony because Anthony Kumina from opie</v>
<v Speaker 4>and anthony had this set up in his </v>

1377
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.590
<v Speaker 4>basement where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1378
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:26.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a lot of money and he had a cool </v>

1379
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:26.650
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

1380
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 4>He live by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he put up a green screen and set up a</v>

1381
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:33.801
<v Speaker 4>stage where he had a nice desk and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>real professional cameras and started </v>

1382
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:39.351
<v Speaker 4>doing this thing called live from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>compound and live from the compound was </v>

1383
01:03:39.351 --> 01:03:43.461
<v Speaker 4>like his own little fuck around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some fun at home show we had like </v>

1384
01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Guinness on tap and he would just drink </v>
<v Speaker 4>and talk shit.</v>

1385
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 4>And it was really fun to watch and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized it was like,</v>

1386
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a guy that's on serious,</v>

1387
01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's on the opening.</v>

1388
01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:55.641
<v Speaker 4>Anthony showed it's very popular show on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sirius and he's decided just for fun to </v>

1389
01:03:55.651 --> 01:03:58.150
<v Speaker 4>do this thing in his basement that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>making any money from it.</v>

1390
01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 4>It's just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about it and I said,</v>

1391
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:03.870
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could probably do something like that.</v>

1392
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 4>And so we started doing it off of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just ustream just sitting there with</v>

1393
01:04:08.941 --> 01:04:11.030
<v Speaker 4>a laptop talking shit that's.</v>

1394
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.460
<v Speaker 4>So my podcast didn't become a like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>itunes podcast for like a few months </v>

1395
01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:21.081
<v Speaker 4>after the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We realized once we started collecting </v>

1396
01:04:21.081 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 4>and we then took the audio and start </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting it up on itunes.</v>

1397
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 4>But there wasn't that much going on back</v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

1398
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.530
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1399
01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 4>we got it in like right at the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1400
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:34.370
<v Speaker 4>And then like in the next few years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other comics started starting their own </v>

1401
01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:36.040
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1402
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 4>and then everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1403
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:40.770
<v Speaker 4>all these different people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Burr and you know,</v>

1404
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:43.340
<v Speaker 4>and Dheas and Dunkin and everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 4>started,</v>

1405
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing podcasts as well.</v>

1406
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:49.260
<v Speaker 4>And they all took off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you are single handedly responsible</v>

1407
01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:52.290
<v Speaker 4>for like the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there are so many podcasts that are</v>

1408
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.330
<v Speaker 4>people who came through your show and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then went,</v>

1409
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should the one,</v>

1410

1413
01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:07.010
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's the best form of if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a comic is the best form of </v>

1414
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:09.560
<v Speaker 4>expression where you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could just,</v>

1427
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.240
<v Speaker 2>It's really completely dependent upon </v>

<v Speaker 2>crutch,</v>

<v Speaker 2>consciousness and give you some unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>insight and yeah,</v>

1446

<v Speaker 2>It makes me like very friendly,</v>

1448
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.280

<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan,</v>

1451
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:07.350
<v Speaker 2>so I have to say I'm a huge fan of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect that has on female sexuality the </v>

1452
01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my experience,</v>

1453
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:12.500
<v Speaker 2>women that respond to weed wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>

1454
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.710
<v Speaker 2>The good ones do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:18.750
<v Speaker 2>My best ally ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely you feel like a god </v>

1456
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.750
<v Speaker 2>you've touched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have multiple.</v>

1457
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's somebody up like that was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That didn't think much.</v>

1458
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Will it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes hugs feel good?</v>

1459
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just hugs.</v>

1460
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Forget about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just smoke weed and hug.</v>

1461
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:29.320
<v Speaker 2>It feels amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you ever done ecstasy?</v>

1462
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:30.790
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1463
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.310
<v Speaker 2>It's been on my to do list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had a.</v>

1464
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:38.370
<v Speaker 2>You could hold hands with dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're on ecstasy and you feel bad </v>

1465
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:38.370
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to do it?</v>

1466
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:42.621
<v Speaker 2>Can Be rubbing each others hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it feel bad at all ever fucked one </v>

1467
01:07:43.421 --> 01:07:44.400
<v Speaker 2>thing that it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1468
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.920
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking terrible for your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least I should qualify that.</v>

1469
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:52.610
<v Speaker 2>That was when I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably did a little too much and uh,</v>

1470
01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>the next day I just was so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

1471
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:59.581
<v Speaker 2>Now my brain didn't work good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to many people who don't </v>

1472
01:07:59.581 --> 01:08:02.581
<v Speaker 2>have that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have to do the same sort </v>

1473
01:08:02.581 --> 01:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>of things with their brain that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1474
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you do,</v>

1475
01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:10.411
<v Speaker 2>like if you go to work and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal job and you don't have to do </v>

1476
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:10.411
<v Speaker 2>anything important and maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

1477
01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:15.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a person who has to think </v>

1478
01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>for a living and you have to do like </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up comedy</v>

1479
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.630
<v Speaker 4>on stage or you have to write or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast or something like that.</v>

1480
01:08:19.631 --> 01:08:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't imagine doing ecstasy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then doing the UFC the next day.</v>

1481
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be a rough.</v>

1482
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

1483
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.620
<v Speaker 4>That kind of the whole theory that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are these,</v>

1484
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what Saturday are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that you take after you take </v>

1485
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:33.400
<v Speaker 4>ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>HTP,</v>

1486
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 4>is that what it takes that allow you not</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have the Dow and thereafter words?</v>

1487
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.080
<v Speaker 4>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1488
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.830
<v Speaker 4>but I would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1489
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only did actually once in the one I did.</v>

1490
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:45.200
<v Speaker 4>I just totally did it naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do take five htp,</v>

1491
01:08:45.201 --> 01:08:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I take new mood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is five htp and l trip to fan.</v>

1492
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.220
<v Speaker 4>That stuff definitely works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>

1493
01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 4>But I've never done it in conjunction </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that with acid but,</v>

1494
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 4>or with molly or ecstasy.</v>

1495
01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 4>But actually that's how it got invented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how new mood got invented.</v>

1496
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Really trying to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mitigate partying.</v>

1497
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:09.930
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just as it was called roll</v>

1498
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:15.940
<v Speaker 4>off did the other day and she had these </v>
<v Speaker 4>old perfect scheme for basically every </v>

1499
01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:20.580
<v Speaker 4>legal prostitution by using a loophole </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1500
01:09:20.581 --> 01:09:21.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's a cabinet,</v>

1501
01:09:21.501 --> 01:09:23.580
<v Speaker 4>our role in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part is not the restitution.</v>

1502
01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 4>That was true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was true.</v>

1503
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I at even sign a contract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could hire someone,</v>

1504
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 4>sign a contract to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1505
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 4>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1506
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 4>a porn film and even just for your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit,</v>

1507
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.010
<v Speaker 4>you could have it for yourself as long </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're filming.</v>

1508
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

1509
01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.980
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1510
01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:40.660
<v Speaker 4>I love the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1511
01:09:40.661 --> 01:09:45.661

<v Speaker 4>but he's not the only one that stopped </v>

1512
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:45.661
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1513
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:45.661

<v Speaker 4>But it's still,</v>

1514
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 4>the porn loophole is how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1515
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:52.780
<v Speaker 4>like porn stars get away with doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote prostitution like that.</v>

1516
01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:57.900
<v Speaker 4>There was a girl that was at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>store and she was telling guys that you </v>

1517
01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 4>could fuck her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to pay her her rate and you</v>

1518
01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.130
<v Speaker 4>have to turn a camera on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1519
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:02.600
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a hooker.</v>

1529
01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 4>if he's the pimp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was right.</v>

1530
01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 4>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1531

1558
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 4>sacred grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacred places.</v>

1559
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.840
<v Speaker 4>Sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The word.</v>

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Just this sacred things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's good and bad in them.</v>

1561
01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:35.290
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1562
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:37.710
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely merit in sacred </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1563
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.600
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's an area in Hawaii where the</v>

1564
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Keck observatory is and they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>construct a larger,</v>

1565
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:52.221
<v Speaker 4>bigger telescope and apparently they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have problems because the native </v>

1566
01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:53.730
<v Speaker 4>American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I native American Hawaiian,</v>

1567
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.790
<v Speaker 4>they're sort of native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiians,</v>

1568
01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that lived there have some </v>

1569
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.510
<v Speaker 4>sacred ground up there that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that you're supposed to build on,</v>

1570
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1571
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1572
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.090
<v Speaker 4>It's their spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1573
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.610
<v Speaker 4>false on some assholes come up there </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a telescope.</v>

1574
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.050
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got that.</v>

1575
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been up there to the Keck </v>
<v Speaker 4>observatory?</v>

1576
01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.870
<v Speaker 4>Not that I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have been to the big island a no.</v>

1577
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Be normally to Maui big island is </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

1578
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange because it's the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the islands,</v>

1579
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's the least populated of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiian islands duct.</v>

1580
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also one where it has all these</v>

1581
01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:31.851
<v Speaker 4>different ecosystems on one island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you go like near the Hilo side </v>

1582
01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:35.380
<v Speaker 4>where Bj Penn's from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all like tropical beautiful God.</v>

1583
01:12:35.381 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 4>It rains all the time and it's lush and </v>
<v Speaker 4>green.</v>

1584
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:42.270
<v Speaker 4>It's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you go to like the other side,</v>

1585
01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:47.090
<v Speaker 4>like the Kona side and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's totally different.</v>

1586
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:52.140
<v Speaker 4>It's drier and then there's areas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have these giant lava beds and it's up </v>

1587
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 4>to the tape to hold the whole place is </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

1588
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 4>Even seemed the lava beds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1589
01:12:55.770 --> 01:13:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some pretty crazy shit on the </v>

1590
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:03.291
<v Speaker 4>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why he's one with this </v>

1591
01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:03.291
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is kind of a nice steady.</v>

1592
01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:03.291
<v Speaker 4>That is even part of the US because he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be the love,</v>

1593
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 4>the fucking pissing people off anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a beautiful place.</v>

1594
01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:09.720
<v Speaker 4>I can see how you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1595
01:13:09.721 --> 01:13:14.721
<v Speaker 4>how about Alaska?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to fly through Canada gets </v>

1596
01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:14.721
<v Speaker 4>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was bizarre.</v>

1597
01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Except frozen Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:20.310
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the APP right there.</v>

1599
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.820
<v Speaker 4>The I'm nobody to think you are saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the sake of it.</v>

1600
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:28.821
<v Speaker 4>And to me it seemed interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 4>precisely because you hold something </v>

1601
01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:33.321
<v Speaker 4>sacred to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to be able to have more to </v>

1602
01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:35.170
<v Speaker 4>laugh to not because you diminish its </v>
<v Speaker 4>importance.</v>

1603
01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.880
<v Speaker 4>He dirt to avoid fucking up and throw an</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 to a dogma.</v>

1604
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:43.970
<v Speaker 4>You know the one theme that keeps things</v>
<v Speaker 4>loose like you speaking of American </v>

1605
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:47.811
<v Speaker 4>Indian stuff is bad twat at the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember being like at some Lakota </v>

1606
01:13:47.811 --> 01:13:47.811
<v Speaker 4>ceremonies wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was he liar.</v>

1607
01:13:47.811 --> 01:13:52.571
<v Speaker 4>He was to see people who have grown app </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dates so far damaged that he other </v>

1608
01:13:52.571 --> 01:13:55.471
<v Speaker 4>thing versus like some white guys were </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up and then they will find out </v>

1609
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:57.260
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He supposed to be right as he ladders.</v>

1610
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:58.980
<v Speaker 4>That was during the break of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ceremony.</v>

1611
01:13:58.981 --> 01:14:03.981
<v Speaker 4>They were giving some of the Sunday and </v>
<v Speaker 4>of giving bikes to settle with the </v>

1612
01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.630
<v Speaker 4>people we're supporting their right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys were taking the pipe.</v>

1613
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:11.690
<v Speaker 4>They will smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will pass it to other people and </v>

1614
01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 4>they gave it to this white lady was </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly</v>

1615
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.970
<v Speaker 3>ticket ourselves real seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1616
01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:17.450
<v Speaker 3>And so she's tried to like the five but </v>
<v Speaker 3>she can that she feels she failed.</v>

1617
01:14:17.451 --> 01:14:22.130
<v Speaker 3>So she thrived and then taking herself </v>
<v Speaker 3>superseded he or she takes a deep breath</v>

1618
01:14:22.131 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 3>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1619
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:27.370
<v Speaker 3>the spirit's the one metal light this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pipe today.</v>

1620
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 3>And there was a lady next to her was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to not die laughing,</v>

1621
01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.060
<v Speaker 3>but she was trying to be polite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1622
01:14:34.061 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 3>But she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1623
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:40.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a windy day just to be okay for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole Lakota lady.</v>

1624
01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 3>The spirits of the love that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely because it's real.</v>

1625
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:52.831
<v Speaker 3>You can call when sometimes the spirits </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to tell you just to relax a </v>

1626
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:56.340
<v Speaker 3>little bit lighter up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:14:56.350 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like someone saying to you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>master chief in most people who say,</v>

1628
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:04.930
<v Speaker 3>no master are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that.</v>

1629
01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 3>They're mean people around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're assholes like me,</v>

1630
01:15:07.481 --> 01:15:09.870
<v Speaker 3>but you just shut the fuck up bitch.</v>

1631
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

1632
01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:16.141
<v Speaker 3>You don't really mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just trying to be like super </v>

1633
01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:16.150
<v Speaker 3>spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I swear to God,</v>

1634
01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:21.151
<v Speaker 3>like there's Yoga teachers that can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it after a yoga class and you'll say it </v>

1635
01:15:21.151 --> 01:15:24.811
<v Speaker 3>back and you mean it because you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>did 90 minutes of hell together and </v>

1636
01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll say it and mean it.</v>

1637
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 3>But that's a tricky thing that sometime </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the guy was there,</v>

1638
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:35.701
<v Speaker 3>yellow deal and the guy was the thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>Elforni can sound exactly the same </v>

1639
01:15:35.701 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 3>except that one is three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want like,</v>

1640
01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.460
<v Speaker 3>to me like a lot of these six about </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirituality,</v>

1641
01:15:39.461 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 3>they don't make me throw up or because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are so cheesy,</v>

1642
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:46.750
<v Speaker 3>so made apps or fig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there are the moments where you</v>

1643
01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:47.590
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

1644
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:52.650
<v Speaker 3>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the other day Mandy's was three p </v>

1645
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:53.980
<v Speaker 3>like this guy I'm from Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emailed me and he's like,</v>

1646
01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:54.730
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had this,</v>

1647
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:56.980
<v Speaker 3>it was a Lakota thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1648
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.690
<v Speaker 3>American Indian stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1649
01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:00.870
<v Speaker 3>we had a ceremony and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was um,</v>

1650
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.250
<v Speaker 3>we parade also for your daughter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah.</v>

1651
01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:03.820
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1652
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:04.460
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sweet.</v>

1653
01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:05.830
<v Speaker 3>And the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1654
01:16:05.831 --> 01:16:10.831
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of have the feeling that she may </v>

1655
01:16:10.831 --> 01:16:13.050
<v Speaker 3>be sensitive to things like the task or </v>
<v Speaker 3>if by any chance she had a dream of </v>

1656
01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:13.960
<v Speaker 3>having to do with American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1657
01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:19.530
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking weird because she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the dreams nine nights out of </v>

1658
01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:19.530
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1659
01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she never mentioned that one,</v>

1660
01:16:20.561 --> 01:16:25.561
<v Speaker 3>so there's no right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I figured out it doesn't matter to </v>

1661
01:16:25.561 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 3>us so I try not to ask a leading </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

1662
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:27.010
<v Speaker 3>So I just asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1663
01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:30.100
<v Speaker 3>did you have any dream last night?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

1664
01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:30.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1665
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 3>you have say bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1666
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.190
<v Speaker 3>And then she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1667
01:16:33.191 --> 01:16:33.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1668
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

1669
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I had a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my grandpa was taking me to this </v>

1670
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.690
<v Speaker 3>place where they were Indians and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught me to speak Lakota and yeah,</v>

1671
01:16:40.691 --> 01:16:42.170
<v Speaker 3>we had a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went like,</v>

1672
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.230
<v Speaker 3>and I don't run with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1673
01:16:47.231 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1674
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:50.350
<v Speaker 3>it's because of this period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this I have no fucking idea.</v>

1675
01:16:50.351 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just reporting what happens.</v>

1676
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:54.250
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go like,</v>

1677
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the universities a lot weirder </v>

1678
01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.791
<v Speaker 3>than we assume sometimes the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with something like that as you can't </v>

1679
01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 3>measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you can't.</v>

1680
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:08.220
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever anybody has a clairvoyant </v>

1681
01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 3>moment or a moment where they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>have</v>

1682
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:14.900
<v Speaker 4>an instinct that doesn't seem to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>any sense but turns out to be true.</v>

1683
01:17:14.901 --> 01:17:15.410
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1684
01:17:15.411 --> 01:17:17.420
<v Speaker 4>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it coincidental?</v>

1685
01:17:17.421 --> 01:17:18.800
<v Speaker 4>Like what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1686
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:23.801
<v Speaker 4>there's like some Sam Harris type people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are like very straightforward,</v>

1687
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 4>rational thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll,</v>

1688
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll sort of boil it down to </v>

1689
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.360
<v Speaker 4>coincidence and I'm not entirely </v>
<v Speaker 4>convinced I like Sam and I don't mean to</v>

1690
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:37.060
<v Speaker 4>talk shit about it because I like him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I did stuff,</v>

1691
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:42.070
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's complete bullshit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me or a fundamentalist as much as the </v>

1692
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:45.930
<v Speaker 4>religious fundamentalists like the going</v>
<v Speaker 4>so badly to explain every single tool </v>

1693
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:50.790
<v Speaker 4>whether you're explaining the as in it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>because God the dds or because no,</v>

1694
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:53.340
<v Speaker 4>it's because he must be a coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the probability of these,</v>

1695
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:56.990
<v Speaker 4>that it's like that can you just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet the life is weird and we don't have</v>

1696
01:17:56.991 --> 01:17:59.180
<v Speaker 4>all the explanations and leave it at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that time.</v>

1697
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.790
<v Speaker 4>He's right most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1698
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of people that try</v>

1699
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:09.791
<v Speaker 4>to make things sound spiritual and </v>
<v Speaker 4>connect circumstances and say,</v>

1700
01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fate and it's,</v>

1701
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:16.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a psychic moment when really it's </v>

1702
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 4>just total coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a lot of that.</v>

1703
01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 4>A lot though is not everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not everything,</v>

1704
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:25.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's hard to differentiate like what</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like you wouldn't you talk to a guy </v>

1705
01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:30.401
<v Speaker 4>and he says that your daughter had some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a dream about native Americans </v>

1706
01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:34.151
<v Speaker 4>financially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's sensitive and then you asked her </v>

1707
01:18:34.151 --> 01:18:34.151
<v Speaker 4>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1708
01:18:34.151 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream about native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the fuck.</v>

1709
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 4>What are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most kids you.</v>

1710
01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream.</v>

1711
01:18:38.211 --> 01:18:43.211
<v Speaker 4>I was on the my little pony store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had all the money in the world that </v>

1712
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:45.690
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally what the fuck are y'all?</v>

1713
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:46.520
<v Speaker 4>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1714
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:48.350
<v Speaker 4>what are the odds of the Sheila remember</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>

1715
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:53.420
<v Speaker 4>What are the odds that you'd have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the topic that she never mentioned </v>

1716
01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 4>once in our life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Science,</v>

1717
01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 4>you ever have a dream about someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you get an email from them the next</v>

1718
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 4>day and you haven't talked to them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago too.</v>

1719
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:02.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily believe that the </v>

1720
01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:03.260
<v Speaker 4>only connections that people have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other a physical,</v>

1721
01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 4>like you have to be there and see each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

1722
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:07.990
<v Speaker 4>They're there very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might be some sort of a,</v>

1723
01:19:07.991 --> 01:19:12.991
<v Speaker 4>a dream state connection or a thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection that we just can't.</v>

1724
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 4>We can't put on a scale that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like take a ruler and go,</v>

1725
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a seven inches long.</v>

1726
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:20.390
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't measure it.</v>

1727
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.030
<v Speaker 4>I said I've had enough of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>

1728
01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:24.770
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to believe because I don't know what</v>

1729
01:19:24.771 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>

1730
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea.</v>

1731
01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the universe works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do we have enough experiences that.</v>

1732
01:19:30.051 --> 01:19:35.051
<v Speaker 4>Let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to dcs that Queens </v>

1733
01:19:35.051 --> 01:19:35.060
<v Speaker 4>student's thesis at Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't do.</v>

1734
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.360
<v Speaker 4>And Stephanie single time that he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaves me with kind of my mind is open </v>

1735
01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 4>to possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's out there.</v>

1736
01:19:42.351 --> 01:19:45.200
<v Speaker 4>There's stuff that I experienced there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff that I don't experience.</v>

1737
01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I have zero beliefs about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality because my tools are very </v>

1738
01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.831
<v Speaker 4>limited about what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that had been enough of those cases </v>

1739
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:53.831
<v Speaker 4>where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

1740
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 4>that was a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was maybe 18 or something.</v>

1741
01:19:56.301 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 4>They had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1742
01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.080
<v Speaker 4>went to hiking with my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go off into my own thing,</v>

1743
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:04.580
<v Speaker 4>and we go back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was great because I was alone with</v>

1744
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 4>this two hot women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guy was with going off.</v>

1745
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

1746
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

1747
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>plea of disappear somewhere and enjoy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1748
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Should have this too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went for the rest of the day.</v>

1749
01:20:15.481 --> 01:20:19.830
<v Speaker 3>This is as good as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like at one point I literally,</v>

1750
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a phone rang where I got up and I'm</v>

1751
01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:23.250
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1752
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.190
<v Speaker 3>there's up at all these duties have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem right now.</v>

1753
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:29.760
<v Speaker 3>And there's really no reason to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he'd be back four hours later,</v>

1754
01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>an hour had gone by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason whatsoever to feel </v>

1755
01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I tell myself.</v>

1756
01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:35.460
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit.</v>

1757
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Why are you making what kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit excuse not to deal with the </v>

1758
01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:40.580
<v Speaker 3>women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

1759
01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:41.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay.</v>

1760
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you?</v>

1761
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 3>And I try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try.</v>

1762
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I keep getting in my head that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1763
01:20:45.481 --> 01:20:47.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking big problem in.</v>

1764
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.730
<v Speaker 3>You may not be a bad idea to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to it,</v>

1765
01:20:50.731 --> 01:20:53.210
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ here ruin my day.</v>

1766
01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Even when you're not here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

1767
01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like,</v>

1768
01:20:57.211 --> 01:20:58.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is bugging me.</v>

1769
01:20:58.081 --> 01:20:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll walk up.</v>

1770
01:20:59.341 --> 01:21:01.710
<v Speaker 3>I'll start going up the mountain and see</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell.</v>

1771
01:21:01.711 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Like none of this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going up the mountain,</v>

1772
01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:08.850
<v Speaker 3>there's 15 different paths that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>take to go up to the mountain.</v>

1773
01:21:08.851 --> 01:21:13.851
<v Speaker 3>I don't know which one I can take a stab</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just pick one because I don't know </v>

1774
01:21:13.851 --> 01:21:17.721
<v Speaker 3>what else to do and I keep going and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year these voice called limit.</v>

1775
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:23.700
<v Speaker 3>So I called back and eventually a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>did my friend's voice calling again.</v>

1776
01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:25.750
<v Speaker 3>I find him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dude got dehydrated.</v>

1777
01:21:25.751 --> 01:21:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I'd gone up too fast too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was done right.</v>

1778
01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:30.570
<v Speaker 3>He had no energy left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on the floor.</v>

1779
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Just collapse them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pussies.</v>

1780

<v Speaker 3>You're hanging around with what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and a peak hour?</v>

1781
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:38.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

1783
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.760

<v Speaker 3>tie,</v>

1784
01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:43.160
<v Speaker 3>but he had been there longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

1785
01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 3>He said it because I don't like him </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

1786
01:21:44.461 --> 01:21:47.550
<v Speaker 3>so I'm all good with that.</v>

1788
01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.980
<v Speaker 3>but that's the universe universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them to dietary should've left </v>

<v Speaker 3>A skull and use it as a candle holder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like that.</v>

1791
01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 3>But you know it doesn't love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1792
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.390

<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You have to carry them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>there eating each other out?</v>

1799
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were right.</v>

1800
01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:21.780
<v Speaker 3>When they're done coming.</v>

1801
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:24.360
<v Speaker 3>They had this attitude which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

<v Speaker 3>out that the guy was sure a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a hero.</v>

1805
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares for the people listening is </v>
<v Speaker 3>making the hand job gesture.</v>

1806
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 3>That's just not up at all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1807
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:48.681
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you just didn't have any faith in </v>

1808
01:22:48.681 --> 01:22:48.681
<v Speaker 3>your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knew he was kind of an idiot.</v>

1809
01:22:48.681 --> 01:22:48.681
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1810
01:22:48.681 --> 01:22:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1811
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be.</v>

1812
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that like the dream thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>from last night,</v>

1813
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.600
<v Speaker 3>that was even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ds One.</v>

1814
01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:56.490
<v Speaker 3>I can see how it could be something goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1815
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Or if I was Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say,</v>

1816
01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just think for a moment.</v>

1817
01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:03.010
<v Speaker 3>The possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1818
01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1819
01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

1820
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:11.070
<v Speaker 4>think that he's necessarily completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>averse to the idea of there being some </v>

1821
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 4>sort of connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he and like you and I agree,</v>

1822
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:18.390
<v Speaker 4>most of that stuff is like the lady that</v>
<v Speaker 4>says the spirits don't want me to let </v>

1823
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 4>the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1824
01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Most of it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree completely,</v>

1825
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.150
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you one thing.</v>

1826
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:27.350
<v Speaker 4>It changed my perception on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on just the supernatural and the </v>

1827
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:32.460
<v Speaker 4>spiritual is looking into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I did that Saifai show and when I </v>

1828
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.410
<v Speaker 4>did a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a show called Joe Rogan questions,</v>

1829
01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:38.450
<v Speaker 4>not Joe Rogan questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything I'm a game show in my head </v>

1830
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 4>and the game showing my head show was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hidden camera show or the people had </v>

1831
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:45.400
<v Speaker 4>like an earpiece in and we would tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to go do things and we set this one</v>

1832
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:50.401
<v Speaker 4>up in Hollywood and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have a game show like here's </v>

1833
01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:50.401
<v Speaker 4>your task.</v>

1834
01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:52.120
<v Speaker 4>This is what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things they had to do was</v>

1835
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 4>we told them that your reporter for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>local television station,</v>

1836
01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 4>you're doing the news and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>reporting on a Ufo sighting.</v>

1837
01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 4>You have to find someone and tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1838
01:24:05.471 --> 01:24:07.960
<v Speaker 4>I had a witness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were here for this Ufo story.</v>

1839
01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:09.970
<v Speaker 4>We have the cameras here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they took off.</v>

1840
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you willing to say that you saw the </v>

1841
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Ufo to wow and fucking everyone said </v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1842
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:18.250
<v Speaker 4>They just went right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only did they say yes,</v>

1843
01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 4>they went right into these elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 4>fake stories on camera and I went,</v>

1844
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.200
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was such an eyeopener for me and I </v>

1845
01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.820
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of those people that you see in</v>

1846
01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:35.821
<v Speaker 4>those Ufo documentaries?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the famous one was the phoenix </v>

1847
01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:35.821
<v Speaker 4>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use the phoenix.</v>

1848
01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 4>The Phoenix lights was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1849
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 4>a series of sightings that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Phoenix,</v>

1850
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I want to say in the early nineties </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

1851
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:48.690
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very controversial because the </v>

1852
01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:48.690
<v Speaker 4>governor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1853
01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:53.660
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was saying he was going to get to the </v>

1854
01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:53.660
<v Speaker 4>bottom of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all like,</v>

1855
01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:57.770
<v Speaker 4>this is a very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he held a press conference and </v>

1856
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 4>made a mockery out of it by having </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>

1857
01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:02.740
<v Speaker 4>a dress up like an alien and say we </v>
<v Speaker 4>found the culprit and here he is.</v>

1858
01:25:02.741 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 4>The guy comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got an alien costume on.</v>

1859
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:08.080
<v Speaker 4>And the UFL believers were really pissed</v>
<v Speaker 4>off because they were like,</v>

1860
01:25:08.081 --> 01:25:09.580
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw something.</v>

1861
01:25:09.581 --> 01:25:13.480
<v Speaker 4>There was a triangle shaped object the </v>
<v Speaker 4>size of a football field.</v>

1862
01:25:13.481 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 4>It was flying overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't making any noise.</v>

1863
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Like all these people had these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these things that they said that </v>

1864
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:23.731
<v Speaker 4>they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's almost no evidence is only </v>

1865
01:25:23.731 --> 01:25:27.001
<v Speaker 4>evidence of these lights that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>floating in the sky that they think </v>

1866
01:25:27.001 --> 01:25:29.350
<v Speaker 4>where there's the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arizona Governor and the fucking alien.</v>

1867
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:34.560
<v Speaker 4>So hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what people were saying that they </v>

1868
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.920
<v Speaker 4>saw there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was one,</v>

1869
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:39.880
<v Speaker 4>there was one explanation that made </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense and that was they were flares,</v>

1870
01:25:39.881 --> 01:25:44.881
<v Speaker 4>that the government had a let loose with</v>
<v Speaker 4>parachutes and they were drifting down </v>

1871
01:25:44.881 --> 01:25:49.621
<v Speaker 4>from the sky slowly and they fell behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountain ranges and that's why they </v>

1872
01:25:49.621 --> 01:25:53.221
<v Speaker 4>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you look at the actual video </v>

1873
01:25:53.221 --> 01:25:55.891
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people did get there just lights </v>

1874
01:25:55.891 --> 01:25:55.891
<v Speaker 4>that are hovering in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

1875
01:25:55.891 --> 01:25:59.440
<v Speaker 4>There's no triangle shaped black objects</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are flying around.</v>

1876
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 4>But everybody had all these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's soon as soon as you start saying,</v>

1877
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:07.930
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a phoenix lights and people saw </v>

1878
01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:07.930
<v Speaker 4>you have for me too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1879
01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:09.080
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on my porch was strange that night</v>

1880
01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:14.081
<v Speaker 4>was electric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt it in the air and I agree with </v>

1881
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:16.880
<v Speaker 4>you if they'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me 99 percent of the stories are such</v>

1882
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:18.700
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to ease.</v>

1883
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Like sometime there are some that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't explain,</v>

1884
01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:23.590
<v Speaker 4>which doesn't mean it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean we know why your.</v>

1885
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes it was a euphoria was anything goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>or he was that.</v>

1886
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:31.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was something that came into </v>

1887
01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:31.541
<v Speaker 4>somebodies dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have no idea,</v>

1889
01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:33.200
<v Speaker 4>but why the hell are we trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain it that way?</v>

1890
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Every single time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1891
01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.520

<v Speaker 4>Who knows why that's a hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's weird to leave it at that.</v>

1893
01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to run with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to deny it either.</v>

<v Speaker 4>roommate dead.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Police eventually discovered that she </v>

1942
01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.361
<v Speaker 4>was being held hostage by Mark </v>
<v Speaker 4>Constantino and apartment belonged to </v>

1943
01:29:01.361 --> 01:29:04.571
<v Speaker 4>one of the couples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adult children attempts to negotiate </v>

1944
01:29:04.571 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 4>failed around 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM.</v>

1945
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:09.771
<v Speaker 4>A Swat team breached the apartment door </v>
<v Speaker 4>and found both people did Jesus Christ </v>

1946
01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:10.320
<v Speaker 4>heavy.</v>

1947
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I can't compute.</v>

1948
01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Why can't people just break up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1949
01:29:14.110 --> 01:29:14.790
<v Speaker 4>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1950
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like murder suicide.</v>

1951
01:29:17.761 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 4>When people break up like God damn you </v>
<v Speaker 4>pussy you fucking pussy.</v>

1952
01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:24.690
<v Speaker 4>You can't handle her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finding a new person.</v>

1953
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are so weak in that regard.</v>

1954
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:32.190
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the weaker aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanity is the inability to accept that</v>

1955
01:29:32.191 --> 01:29:33.660
<v Speaker 4>someone doesn't want to fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1956
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:37.410
<v Speaker 4>She knew Dick let her go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's still,</v>

1957
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.500
<v Speaker 4>she's still got some life left dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing you are 17,</v>

1958
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:41.850
<v Speaker 4>you should be over that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1959
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:45.360
<v Speaker 4>you deal with it the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So brutal.</v>

1960
01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't even dig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when people flip out about access,</v>

1961
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:51.510
<v Speaker 4>you know he's almost a stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I everybody thought about their ex.</v>

1962
01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:54.870
<v Speaker 4>No motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You borrowed them into your life.</v>

1963
01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Speaker 4>You are the one who like if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it,</v>

1964
01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.580
<v Speaker 4>worry about what's going on with you.</v>

1965
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:04.580
<v Speaker 4>If they were really that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were such horrible human beings </v>

1966
01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:07.641
<v Speaker 4>and yard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wine opener with that mean or maybe </v>

1967
01:30:07.641 --> 01:30:10.101
<v Speaker 4>they are not a fucking bad and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just blowing it out over a bar from </v>

1968
01:30:10.101 --> 01:30:12.630
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] they are meeting and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with the fact that they are with </v>

1969
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:12.630
<v Speaker 4>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1970
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:12.630
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely that.</v>

1971
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:17.091
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely some people that got </v>

1972
01:30:17.091 --> 01:30:18.411
<v Speaker 4>fucked over like divorces were dudes </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to pay hundreds of thousands of </v>

1973
01:30:18.411 --> 01:30:23.120
<v Speaker 4>dollars for the rest of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even that to me is interesting </v>

1974
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:23.120
<v Speaker 4>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1975
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

1976
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:29.450
<v Speaker 4>it's the same woman that you built in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life and you need to fucking see </v>

1977
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:30.780
<v Speaker 4>that she was capable of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1978
01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:35.781
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why she's the scum of the earth and you </v>

1979
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:37.971
<v Speaker 4>can and should be a piece with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would also reserve a little bit for </v>

1980
01:30:37.971 --> 01:30:41.841
<v Speaker 4>your own judgment of how you open the </v>
<v Speaker 4>door to this lady and the problem is </v>

1981
01:30:41.841 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 4>that there's a legal option.</v>

1982
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 4>It's not that she's a scum of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is you are breaking up.</v>

1983
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 4>She does feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I'm not saying,</v>

1984
01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that you shouldn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain when someone wants to fuck someone </v>

1985
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:52.580
<v Speaker 4>else because you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1986
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.520
<v Speaker 4>it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to feel terrible.</v>

1987
01:30:53.521 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 4>You're going to feel jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to feel sadness,</v>

1988
01:30:55.771 --> 01:30:57.180
<v Speaker 4>you're going to feel lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen,</v>

1989
01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying is you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>some fucking perspective.</v>

1990
01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>She's an older lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not.</v>

2052
01:33:37.421 --> 01:33:38.620
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't have the best health.</v>

2053
01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 4>Like what is she going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's just going to keep taking hundreds</v>

2054
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.130
<v Speaker 4>of thousands of dollars every year </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the law says it's okay.</v>

2055
01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a lot of like those</v>

2056
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:51.040
<v Speaker 4>are pretty dramatic extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

2057
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:54.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to take a banyan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to go back to work 10 hours a day.</v>

2058
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Says that or says that they never passed</v>
<v Speaker 4>that my point.</v>

2059
01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the other one is also Yara.</v>

2060
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:05.701
<v Speaker 4>NASA is not just each day or is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>option is you choose an option that's </v>

2061
01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:06.520
<v Speaker 4>designed to bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other person that I.</v>

2062
01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 4>When you know it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2063
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:10.240
<v Speaker 4>he makes good money so it's not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been getting bullied,</v>

2064
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:15.390
<v Speaker 4>bled dry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has to pay an exorbitant amount </v>

2065
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:19.171
<v Speaker 4>of money every year to a person that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't fuck anymore and now he has a </v>

2066
01:34:19.171 --> 01:34:23.191
<v Speaker 4>wife and he has children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a whole new family and still a </v>

2067
01:34:23.191 --> 01:34:25.060
<v Speaker 4>giant chunk of his income goes to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>lady that he doesn't have anything to do</v>

2068
01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:27.310
<v Speaker 4>with anymore and it will to the day she </v>
<v Speaker 4>dies.</v>

2069
01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:30.160
<v Speaker 4>So she lives to be 500 years old because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of modern science.</v>

2070
01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Fucking dude is paying her for the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>400 years.</v>

2071
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:34.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2072
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes you think twice about.</v>

2073
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's stupid and I'm married and I'm </v>

2074
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you right now,</v>

2075
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:43.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm a happily married person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love my wife.</v>

2076
01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:46.030
<v Speaker 4>I love having a family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nice for me.</v>

2077
01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:48.160
<v Speaker 4>It works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's stupid.</v>

2078
01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.060
<v Speaker 4>Like the contract is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a dumb legal contract and it's.</v>

2079
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.080
<v Speaker 4>It's an archaic one and I can understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>a child support.</v>

2080
01:34:58.881 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 4>I can understand all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand all that,</v>

2081
01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:06.380
<v Speaker 4>but what drives me crazy is this idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in my friend's case,</v>

2082
01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.640
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he lived with her for 12 years,</v>

2083
01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:15.670
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was more than 12 years ago that they </v>

2084
01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:15.670
<v Speaker 4>separate it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's think of that so it,</v>

2085
01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:17.750
<v Speaker 4>but because he lived with her for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2086
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:22.940
<v Speaker 4>he has somehow or another fucked her to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where she can't work anymore.</v>

2087
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:26.120
<v Speaker 4>He gave her so much dick during the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're together.</v>

2088
01:35:26.121 --> 01:35:31.121
<v Speaker 4>She just discombobulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can't fill out a form if you have a </v>

2089
01:35:31.121 --> 01:35:31.340
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2090
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>When the child turns 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're no longer legally responsible.</v>

2091
01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.170
<v Speaker 4>That's an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're gone.</v>

2092
01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.430
<v Speaker 4>If you have child support,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to pay it after 18.</v>

2093
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.590
<v Speaker 4>When they become 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your.</v>

2094
01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:45.710
<v Speaker 4>You have to get a job kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out a way to feed </v>

2095
01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:45.710
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the growth of life,</v>

2096
01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:49.570
<v Speaker 4>not when you're a grown woman and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a grown woman and she was in her </v>

2097
01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 4>forties when they broke up and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever fucking reason.</v>

2098
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:57.550
<v Speaker 4>We have these wacky laws that state that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person doesn't have to work again </v>

2099
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.550
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No children by the way.</v>

2100
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:58.550
<v Speaker 4>No children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

2101
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.200
<v Speaker 4>They never had kids together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

2102
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:05.270
<v Speaker 4>These 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The magic number is like if it was 11 </v>

2103
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.270
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

2104
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to it like,</v>

2105
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2106
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.200
<v Speaker 4>I think it varies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think in California for whatever </v>

2107
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:11.200
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was 12.</v>

2108
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think 10 is a big one,</v>

2109
01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:19.690
<v Speaker 4>like 10 years is the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it might've been that it was 10 </v>

2110
01:36:19.690 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 4>because a Ralphie may just got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got jacked.</v>

2111
01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Apparently his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2112
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:28.450
<v Speaker 4>his woman just divorced him after 10 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that same number 10 and at 10 the party </v>

2113
01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:32.910
<v Speaker 4>begins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you are thinking about it,</v>

2114
01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 4>now is the time to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to imagine someone not being </v>

2115
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:40.220
<v Speaker 4>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet you have to pay the money.</v>

2116
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up.</v>

2117
01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.400
<v Speaker 4>And they're just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in his case,</v>

2118
01:36:43.401 --> 01:36:48.401
<v Speaker 4>like his wife has children or his ex </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife now has children from him and so he</v>

2119
01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 4>is definitely financial responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>her children,</v>

2120
01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:53.400
<v Speaker 4>his children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

2121
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:54.050
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2122
01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 4>their children and I think he should pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>alimony because she has to take care of </v>

2123
01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:02.060
<v Speaker 4>those kids and she can't really work.</v>

2124
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2125
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:04.520
<v Speaker 4>she's not like a free person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>single,</v>

2126
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.290
<v Speaker 4>but if you're a free person that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>single,</v>

2127
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:09.620
<v Speaker 4>I can understand you needing a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years to get on your feet.</v>

2128
01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:14.650
<v Speaker 4>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean about the grades is </v>

2129
01:37:14.650 --> 01:37:14.850
<v Speaker 4>like one is one extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one is you get nothing years.</v>

2130
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you say if you live with a </v>

2131
01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:22.841
<v Speaker 4>woman and for 10 years you're married </v>
<v Speaker 4>and for 10 years she doesn't have to </v>

2132
01:37:22.841 --> 01:37:26.561
<v Speaker 4>work because you're some fucking diamond</v>
<v Speaker 4>merchant downtown la or something like </v>

2133
01:37:26.561 --> 01:37:30.521
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you break up with her and then you </v>

2134
01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:30.521
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got a house,</v>

2135
01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:30.521
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on your own.</v>

2136
01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:32.540
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't have any skills or anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's fucked up.</v>

2137
01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Capital fierce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These fierce,</v>

2138
01:37:33.610 --> 01:37:38.610
<v Speaker 4>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that is a reasonable </v>

2139
01:37:38.610 --> 01:37:40.571
<v Speaker 4>compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's this weird thing that they </v>

2140
01:37:40.571 --> 01:37:42.110
<v Speaker 4>do where it's called the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2141
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:44.630
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to maintain the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality of life.</v>

2142
01:37:44.631 --> 01:37:45.770
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2143
01:37:45.771 --> 01:37:50.771
<v Speaker 4>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're living with like coby </v>

2144
01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:50.771
<v Speaker 4>Bryant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like coby Brian's wife,</v>

2145
01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:55.190
<v Speaker 4>like she's responsible for his children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she should certainly get money and.</v>

2146
01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.080
<v Speaker 4>But how much money man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2147
01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 4>how does she get hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>

2148
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 4>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2149
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forever.</v>

2150
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nuts to the end of time.</v>

2151
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 4>Till till the day they die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't have a Prenup,</v>

2152
01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.150
<v Speaker 4>get ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2153
01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2154
01:38:11.161 --> 01:38:12.910
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it prenup is not real bad.</v>

2155
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Like fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a construct.</v>

2156
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is a colon threat with a</v>

2157
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:19.470
<v Speaker 4>volts the states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't have a Prenup,</v>

2158
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:21.870
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those conversations get way more intense</v>

2159
01:38:21.871 --> 01:38:26.871
<v Speaker 4>when things get ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a woman knows there's no prenup </v>

2160
01:38:26.871 --> 01:38:26.871
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:38:26.871 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a buddy who doesn't have a </v>

2162
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 4>prenup and him and his wife are fighting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I go,</v>

2163
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 4>do you have a prenup?</v>

2164
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:35.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dare you could say we were having a </v>

2165
01:38:38.521 --> 01:38:39.440
<v Speaker 4>conversation about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2166
01:38:39.450 --> 01:38:44.450
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't figure out a way to like </v>

2167
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.450
<v Speaker 4>justify having a prenup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2168
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:48.351
<v Speaker 4>here's a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were in love and you're married </v>

2169
01:38:48.351 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 4>together and you're going to be together</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever,</v>

2170
01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:51.570
<v Speaker 4>the Prenup doesn't mean shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean anything.</v>

2171
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.850
<v Speaker 4>If you really plan on being together </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever,</v>

2172
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000
<v Speaker 4>but have that person wants to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>abandoned ship than drain you like a </v>

2173
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.610
<v Speaker 4>fucking plug at the bottom of a bathtub </v>
<v Speaker 4>will will,</v>

2174
01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:03.330
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will blow,</v>

2175
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 4>will bump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you need a prenup.</v>

2176
01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're gonna break up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an a prenup comes into play and </v>

2177
01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:12.000
<v Speaker 4>then you need it and you should have it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2178
01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:13.650
<v Speaker 4>but if you're going to be together </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever,</v>

2179
01:39:13.651 --> 01:39:18.651
<v Speaker 4>the Prenup doesn't mean a goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're going to be together </v>

2180
01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:18.651
<v Speaker 4>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so don't worry about it.</v>

2181
01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:20.250
<v Speaker 4>Get a fucking prenup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Silly Bitch.</v>

2182
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:25.430
<v Speaker 4>It only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only becomes a factor if you get </v>

2183
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:28.191
<v Speaker 4>divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why any woman that says he wants </v>

2184
01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:28.191
<v Speaker 4>to have a peanut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think it's gonna last?</v>

2185
01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:30.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is going to last,</v>

2186
01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:34.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't this fucking.</v>

2187
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:37.710
<v Speaker 4>The logic of not having a prenup is </v>
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>

2188
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 4>If we break up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get financially fucked.</v>

2189
01:39:41.650 --> 01:39:45.820
<v Speaker 4>That's how much I love you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to stay together.</v>

2190
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
<v Speaker 4>I want to stay together with you under </v>
<v Speaker 4>the threat of being financially ruined </v>

2191
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.600
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise it's now through love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2192
01:39:52.601 --> 01:39:54.960
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking chick said to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The date was hilarious.</v>

2193
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:55.770

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2194
01:39:55.830 --> 01:40:00.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More and more women today are paying </v>

2195
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.830
<v Speaker 4>alimony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go name one.</v>

2196
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:03.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like silence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roseanne Barr,</v>

2197
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.430
<v Speaker 4>that's all they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roseanne Barr.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We got one under our belt.</v>

2200
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 4>That's one victory as opposed to a what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2201
01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds of millions of guys that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been fucked over by the system.</v>

2202
01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:36.480
<v Speaker 4>nature of shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you need to all this shit in?</v>

2208
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it's well over a million dollars.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's for the longest time I had these </v>
<v Speaker 3>exact dynamics that I'm criticizing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's totally fine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's insecurity.</v>

2356
01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:24.560
<v Speaker 3>That's if I let her go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never get laid with the hottest </v>

<v Speaker 2>That works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2390
01:49:01.991 --> 01:49:03.010
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2391
01:49:03.011 --> 01:49:04.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you gotta do just sleep with time</v>

2392
01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:09.631
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are up to doing pushups </v>

2393
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:09.631
<v Speaker 2>now me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sleep my time away.</v>

2394
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:09.631
<v Speaker 2>By the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2395
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:10.840
<v Speaker 2>two years is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2396
01:49:10.841 --> 01:49:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I slept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got arrested.</v>

2397
01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen hours a day.</v>

2398
01:49:15.711 --> 01:49:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an asshole.</v>

2399
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:19.420
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2400
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.930
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2401
01:49:20.931 --> 01:49:23.930
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some girls are just so hot and then it's</v>

2402
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:26.480
<v Speaker 2>also like there's something else that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2403
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Love is real and emotions are real and </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciating someone is real and there's</v>

2404
01:49:33.891 --> 01:49:38.891
<v Speaker 2>definitely that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also some biological tricks </v>

2405
01:49:38.891 --> 01:49:40.040
<v Speaker 2>that go on when you connect with someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have sex with them.</v>

2406
01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:45.400
<v Speaker 2>There's like some weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessive tricks where your DNA doesn't</v>

2407
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>want them to be with</v>

2408
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 4>anyone else because your DNA wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>procreate with them and that's where you</v>

2409
01:49:52.451 --> 01:49:57.451
<v Speaker 4>have to protect this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one person who you're shooting </v>

2410
01:49:57.451 --> 01:49:57.940
<v Speaker 4>loads into who you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>babies with.</v>

2411
01:49:57.941 --> 01:49:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking to?</v>

2412
01:49:58.961 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 4>That guy I saw the way that guy hugged </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2413
01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:03.730
<v Speaker 4>like all this craziness that comes about</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2414
01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:04.320
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2415
01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.360
<v Speaker 4>that person becomes you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They become your property,</v>

2416
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:10.030
<v Speaker 4>but you can't control them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if they're freaky,</v>

2417
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:12.940
<v Speaker 4>if they're crazy freaky bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to go this crazy freaky bitches.</v>

2418
01:50:12.941 --> 01:50:17.941
<v Speaker 4>Probably crazy with other dudes too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she's probably been crazy </v>

2419
01:50:17.941 --> 01:50:20.970
<v Speaker 4>freaky bitch with other dudes before me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I have to think that those dudes </v>

2420
01:50:20.970 --> 01:50:25.060
<v Speaker 4>know that she's slinging that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>superstitious stitious pussy out there.</v>

2421
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:30.600
<v Speaker 4>What I think anybody ever in the history</v>
<v Speaker 4>of mankind use of still arts together.</v>

2422
01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:31.790
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's first,</v>

2423
01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:34.370
<v Speaker 4>she's got some fucking Voodoo Posey.</v>

2424
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:38.260
<v Speaker 4>She's got some supernatural pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that can do things better</v>

2425
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:40.200
<v Speaker 4>and includes fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2426
01:50:40.201 --> 01:50:45.201
<v Speaker 4>like everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have you dated a girl who was really </v>

2427
01:50:45.201 --> 01:50:45.201
<v Speaker 4>hot but just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible in bed.</v>

2428
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:46.840
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I miss out on that experience.</v>

2429
01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.850
<v Speaker 4>I went on a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had one of them.</v>

2430
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta stop with your Skus.</v>

2431
01:50:50.911 --> 01:50:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Stopped doing really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2432
01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:57.951
<v Speaker 4>she's just a for all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess like maybe it wasn't her fault.</v>

2433
01:50:59.081 --> 01:51:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she was just like insecure or </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable or unaware or,</v>

2434
01:51:03.461 --> 01:51:08.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turned out later on that I found the </v>

2435
01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:08.640
<v Speaker 4>shed like a coke problem that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't aware of that would,</v>

2436
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:14.100
<v Speaker 4>that I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apparently that just blocks you off </v>

2437
01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:14.890
<v Speaker 4>from like emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What of it is that,</v>

2438
01:51:14.891 --> 01:51:17.560
<v Speaker 4>what made it bad side?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just,</v>

2439
01:51:17.561 --> 01:51:18.460
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't good.</v>

2440
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:23.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the girl that I dated before </v>

2441
01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:23.970
<v Speaker 4>her was a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>

2442
01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:25.900
<v Speaker 4>oh my God are lowering sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun.</v>

2443
01:51:25.901 --> 01:51:26.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when someone's just,</v>

2445
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.940
<v Speaker 4>when they're all in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2446
01:51:30.941 --> 01:51:35.941
<v Speaker 4>and then the next girl is not all in you</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kind flying someone was all in my </v>

2447
01:51:35.941 --> 01:51:40.120
<v Speaker 4>head a gamble for the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to pay play penny slots.</v>

2448
01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:43.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm here to push a fucking mortgage into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the center of the table and go,</v>

2449
01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:46.570
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the excitement is,</v>

2450
01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:51.571
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you make of Australia and </v>

2451
01:51:51.571 --> 01:51:53.851
<v Speaker 4>ability to instead turn off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second thing you are talking about </v>

2452
01:51:53.851 --> 01:51:54.320
<v Speaker 4>sort of that DNA like your mind and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2453
01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:55.920
<v Speaker 4>the possessiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jealousy,</v>

2454
01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.320
<v Speaker 4>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole uh,</v>

2455
01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Chris Ryan ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

2456
01:51:58.660 --> 01:51:59.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2457
01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:01.530
<v Speaker 4>he sold it to theory about just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamy.</v>

2458
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's all about happy monkeys having sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>with each other and just let it be.</v>

2459
01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:11.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's something that you can </v>

2460
01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:11.370
<v Speaker 4>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2461
01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:14.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really when you boil down </v>
<v Speaker 4>to what it really is,</v>

2462
01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:17.610
<v Speaker 4>when you boil it down to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2463
01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:20.500
<v Speaker 4>if you can be objective about if it's at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all possible,</v>

2464
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:23.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why is,</v>

2465
01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.340
<v Speaker 4>why should you be the only person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>can give that person pleasure?</v>

2466
01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Why should that person be the only place</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you get pleasure?</v>

2467
01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:35.610
<v Speaker 4>Are we slaves to these ancient emotions </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ancient connections that we have to </v>

2468
01:52:36.911 --> 01:52:39.790
<v Speaker 4>other human beings that were really </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on scarcity?</v>

2469
01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.010
<v Speaker 4>I think whenever things are based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>scarcity,</v>

2470
01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.080
<v Speaker 4>you know the idea that you'll be alone </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't want.</v>

2471
01:52:44.081 --> 01:52:44.970
<v Speaker 4>I've heard she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be with them.</v>

2472
01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:50.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like famine thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that means if I don't eat this meal </v>

2473
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:50.660
<v Speaker 4>hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do more meals.</v>

2474
01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 4>Does that fam and thinking when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>to friends,</v>

2475
01:52:53.031 --> 01:52:55.070
<v Speaker 4>like if you ever have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what were you hanging out with them</v>

2476
01:52:55.071 --> 01:52:57.200
<v Speaker 4>for where you fucking even hang out with</v>
<v Speaker 4>me anymore.</v>

2477
01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:00.520
<v Speaker 4>That's the surest way to lose a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Upset.</v>

2478
01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:05.580
<v Speaker 4>What could become like really needy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you'd get upset that that friend </v>

2479
01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 4>hangs out with other friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

2480
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:08.180
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People like that are ridiculous and I've</v>

2481
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 4>had friends like that before and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>get it when,</v>

2482
01:53:10.131 --> 01:53:11.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only when I was younger.</v>

2483
01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:16.540
<v Speaker 4>When you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're younger you're sort of </v>

2484
01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:18.161
<v Speaker 4>figuring out what style of person you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are and how do you live your life and </v>

2485
01:53:18.161 --> 01:53:20.450
<v Speaker 4>what's acceptable and what's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptable and you know,</v>

2486
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:24.110
<v Speaker 4>the people that are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're aware or not,</v>

2487
01:53:24.111 --> 01:53:29.111
<v Speaker 4>they're just incredibly manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might not even be aware of why or </v>

2488
01:53:29.111 --> 01:53:32.030
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes to relationships,</v>

2489
01:53:32.031 --> 01:53:35.960
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times people also mirror the </v>
<v Speaker 4>family that they grew up in.</v>

2490
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you grew up in a really jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really abusive family,</v>

2491
01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:41.360
<v Speaker 4>sure you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

2492
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:43.410
<v Speaker 4>it can mirror itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2493
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.000
<v Speaker 4>mirror itself and you or it can be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exact opposite where you see how </v>

2494
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:49.220
<v Speaker 4>retarded your parents were and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2495
01:53:49.221 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 4>well fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be like that anymore.</v>

2496
01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:57.340
<v Speaker 4>So I think Chris is obviously a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant guy and a Chris Ryan's book.</v>

2497
01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:59.800
<v Speaker 4>It's an excellent book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2498
01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really highly respected.</v>

2499
01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got some real good points </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you can intellectualize it and be</v>

2500
01:54:07.041 --> 01:54:08.830
<v Speaker 4>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:09.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2502
01:54:09.711 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 4>if you're happy living that life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's happy,</v>

2503
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:17.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he knows a lot of people that also </v>

2504
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.470
<v Speaker 4>live like that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing wrong with it.</v>

2505
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.470
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2506
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:18.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

2507
01:54:18.450 --> 01:54:19.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2508
01:54:19.431 --> 01:54:21.230
<v Speaker 4>I recommend he lays out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Makes perfect sense.</v>

2509
01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:23.690
<v Speaker 4>I think he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a.</v>

2510
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:26.430
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people it's hard tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Overdose.</v>

2511
01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:32.400
<v Speaker 4>They still are possessive and jealous </v>
<v Speaker 4>and don't have that and they can deal </v>

2512
01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:35.470
<v Speaker 4>with the idea that somebody's date law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's supposed to be all me.</v>

2513
01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:36.170
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

2514
01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:38.230
<v Speaker 4>You can't have sex with somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They flip out.</v>

2515
01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:39.100
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2516
01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:41.240
<v Speaker 4>To me when you think about it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really make sense.</v>

2517
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2518
01:54:42.021 --> 01:54:45.050
<v Speaker 4>what else does it make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monogamy doesn't make sense,</v>

2519
01:54:45.051 --> 01:54:48.380
<v Speaker 4>but neither does polygamy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It [inaudible] make sense?</v>

2520
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:50.060
<v Speaker 4>You should do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2521
01:54:50.110 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 4>Like what if you're in monogamy </v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamy's great.</v>

2522
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:54.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2523
01:54:54.441 --> 01:54:57.100
<v Speaker 4>If you work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why should ensure way.</v>

2524
01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.320
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you find one person and it doesn't </v>

2525
01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:05.591
<v Speaker 4>work with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's not the one you should be </v>

2526
01:55:05.591 --> 01:55:07.811
<v Speaker 4>monogamous with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't mean that you can't be </v>

2527
01:55:07.811 --> 01:55:09.971
<v Speaker 4>monogamous with somebody else or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>even that same person in another stage </v>

2528
01:55:09.971 --> 01:55:10.610
<v Speaker 4>of your life.</v>

2529
01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:12.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes things change.</v>

2530
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:14.300
<v Speaker 4>I get a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

2531
01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:18.860
<v Speaker 4>the idea idea is the one that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most sense and all philosophical.</v>

2532
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:24.550
<v Speaker 4>But every single dive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to throw it out there at the lady I </v>

2533
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 4>wanted to get into a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the discussion.</v>

2534
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:30.700
<v Speaker 4>Was he variably it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Pauline's bots can.</v>

2535
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.790
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2536
01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:33.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's a choice,</v>

2537
01:55:33.651 --> 01:55:34.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2538
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:37.090
<v Speaker 4>do I want it anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Giving these fetal is off.</v>

2539
01:55:37.091 --> 01:55:42.091
<v Speaker 4>He called it sound cooler or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the times when I have gone for </v>

2540
01:55:42.091 --> 01:55:42.091
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10.</v>

2541
01:55:42.091 --> 01:55:42.440
<v Speaker 4>So he was dead in monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

2542
01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 4>That's totally with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2543
01:55:43.741 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't</v>

2544
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:44.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2545
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I spend my days thinking about what are </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

2546
01:55:46.801 --> 01:55:51.801
<v Speaker 2>I was completely happy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I uncompleted way too dark to me is </v>

2547
01:55:51.801 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 2>not a test to be one way or the other is</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever works at the end of the day,</v>

2548
01:55:55.771 --> 01:56:00.771
<v Speaker 2>but whatever works means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having the flexibility to say maybe </v>

2549
01:56:00.771 --> 01:56:03.830
<v Speaker 2>the traditional monogamous ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the only fucking way to get there </v>

2550
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 2>are other ways to go about it or just as</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2551
01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there certainly are other ways to go </v>

2552
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.751
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's people that live in the </v>

2553
01:56:11.751 --> 01:56:11.940
<v Speaker 2>house and it's a man with like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2554
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2555
01:56:12.781 --> 01:56:17.730
<v Speaker 2>or a woman with three men and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking drug dealer moving.</v>

2556
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that like an Oliver Stone movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a chicken two dudes and </v>

2557

<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>open relationship unless they're </v>

01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Like a limo driver in an uber driver </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2617
01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get a limo they kinda like </v>

2620
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:09.040

<v Speaker 2>you get what you pay for that.</v>

2623
01:59:14.911 --> 01:59:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bucket.</v>

2624

01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Every time I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hoping I get him as a driver </v>

02:00:03.150 --> 02:00:03.990
<v Speaker 2>gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'll catch that.</v>

2644
02:00:03.991 --> 02:00:08.991
<v Speaker 2>I guy send him back to Joel to pick him </v>
<v Speaker 2>up at the airport because they have </v>

2645
02:00:08.991 --> 02:00:10.450
<v Speaker 2>clubs that go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have specific swinging clubs.</v>

2646
02:00:11.210 --> 02:00:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2647
02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:13.420
<v Speaker 2>how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could everybody just,</v>

2648
02:00:13.421 --> 02:00:14.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sits on people's labs.</v>

2649
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:16.260
<v Speaker 2>You go to people and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2650
02:00:16.290 --> 02:00:18.550
<v Speaker 2>but they all probably looked like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked disgusting,</v>

2651
02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a balding dude with a ponytail</v>

2652
02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:26.581
<v Speaker 2>and he was tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had a gut and like it was just </v>

2653
02:00:26.581 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 2>skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fat six,</v>

2654
02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I was also bored.</v>

2655
02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:31.950
<v Speaker 2>You have your playboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does everybody look like they are out of</v>

2656
02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.640
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's awesome to see the reality or </v>

2657

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that totally sucks.</v>

2658
02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is most people that want to </v>

2659
02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.091
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a whole lot of other </v>

2660
02:00:48.091 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 2>options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's probably only like one super</v>

2661
02:00:50.021 --> 02:00:53.620
<v Speaker 2>hot slutty girl that goes to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things just loves being the Belle of the</v>

2662
02:00:53.621 --> 02:00:58.621
<v Speaker 2>ball because if you go to like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>swingers thing and you're actually hot </v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2731
02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>But that's a human thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people that want to be </v>

2732
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 2>connected so badly to someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll lie about being on the pill.</v>

2733
02:04:13.150 --> 02:04:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had friends that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were having sex with a girl and the</v>

2734
02:04:16.491 --> 02:04:17.870
<v Speaker 2>girl's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

2735
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just so you can pull out.</v>

2736
02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>So they'll google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2737
02:04:21.321 --> 02:04:25.190
<v Speaker 2>when you dicks hard,</v>

2738
02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:26.810
<v Speaker 2>that you're operating on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2739
02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:32.140
<v Speaker 2>And so they tried to pull out and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl wrap their legs around him and </v>

2740
02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let him pull out serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but at least you've got relaxed.</v>

2776
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>The Dep secs now just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2777
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:09.950
<v Speaker 2>just the idea that some of them would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many nipples and so self centered </v>

2778
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 2>that they would decide to have a baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone against that person's will.</v>

2779
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the head.</v>

2782
02:06:19.610 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 2>You're not just mentally fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're now connected to this person.</v>

2783
02:06:23.161 --> 02:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>You're you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like that you've,</v>

02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:28.680
<v Speaker 2>you're not just mentally fucked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulative and evil,</v>

2785
02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>but you're connected to a person who had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baby with you know,</v>

2786
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.950
<v Speaker 2>and it was all because you live.</v>

2787
02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:36.030
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2788
02:06:36.330 --> 02:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Sex is weird because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes people feel good.</v>

2789
02:06:42.570 --> 02:06:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Like if it was just like hugging or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2790
02:06:44.911 --> 02:06:49.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being affectionate and just making out </v>

2791
02:06:49.911 --> 02:06:49.911
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2792
02:06:49.911 --> 02:06:53.061
<v Speaker 2>that's all great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes people like blow jobs don't</v>

2793
02:06:53.131 --> 02:06:55.200
<v Speaker 2>make people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're awesome,</v>

2794
02:06:55.770 --> 02:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>but they do not make people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking actually makes people like what </v>

2795
02:07:01.231 --> 02:07:04.470
<v Speaker 2>a bizarre way of reproducing that be </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2796
02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Like you're drawn to someone you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>live without them.</v>

2797
02:07:07.591 --> 02:07:12.591
<v Speaker 2>The touches so magical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find your person what ridiculous.</v>

2798
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:20.660
<v Speaker 2>That's when you got to see that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe has been designed by somebody </v>

2799
02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:23.541
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of sense of your worry if there is </v>

2800
02:07:23.541 --> 02:07:23.541
<v Speaker 2>any design behind it because he's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of a shit.</v>

2801
02:07:23.541 --> 02:07:24.250
<v Speaker 2>He's just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

2802
02:07:25.130 --> 02:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it all makes sense.</v>

2803
02:07:26.611 --> 02:07:31.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean this the only way to really truly</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure that people have sex when times </v>

2804
02:07:32.101 --> 02:07:37.101
<v Speaker 2>are tough and you know the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rough and logically and intellectually </v>

2805
02:07:37.391 --> 02:07:42.391
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have a baby and you have to </v>

2806
02:07:42.391 --> 02:07:44.760
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to hide it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>barbarian hordes because you love it so </v>

2807
02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:48.421
<v Speaker 2>much and you have these urges and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile the reason why the barbarian </v>

2808
02:07:48.421 --> 02:07:49.360
<v Speaker 2>hordes are showing up in the first place</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're looking for pussy.</v>

2809
02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:53.180
<v Speaker 2>So little things crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the when he studied,</v>

2810
02:07:53.190 --> 02:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>what does it show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some condoms use to contain spermicides,</v>

2811
02:07:57.221 --> 02:08:02.221
<v Speaker 2>but most don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's best to use condoms without </v>

2812
02:08:02.221 --> 02:08:02.440
<v Speaker 2>spermicide says who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person who wants babies.</v>

2813
02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You fuck</v>

2814
02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:07.300
<v Speaker 5>it says the most looking at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So spermicide can actually increase.</v>

2815
02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:12.400
<v Speaker 5>Chances of sti is such as HIV chlamydia </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it can cause the irritation </v>

2816
02:08:14.001 --> 02:08:17.510
<v Speaker 5>which can lead to the rubbing and blood </v>
<v Speaker 5>shadow.</v>

2817
02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe on your Dick,</v>

<v Speaker 2>things and I definitely know the </v>

2825

<v Speaker 2>Come clean.</v>

2835
02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:04.600

<v Speaker 2>I don't think he burst.</v>

2836
02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I did.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but who knows?</v>

2838
02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.420
<v Speaker 2>He's so hilarious because when he came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and talked about it,</v>

2839
02:09:13.421 --> 02:09:15.730
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like he wants to set the </v>
<v Speaker 2>record straight.</v>

2840
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:17.590
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't want to pay anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

2841
02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:23.040
<v Speaker 2>so he decided to just to put up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a stop to all the financial bleeding</v>

2842
02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:25.090
<v Speaker 2>that was going on in his life.</v>

2843
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:30.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting tale.</v>

2844
02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:35.250
<v Speaker 2>The Charlie Sheen tale because it went </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a tale of sort of almost like </v>

2845
02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:38.330
<v Speaker 2>heroic excess to like a sadness thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2846
02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Victim ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See his teeth?</v>

2847
02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like falling out of his head.</v>

2848
02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:47.530
<v Speaker 2>There's photos or I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess smoking cracks.</v>

2850
02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Not good for your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2851
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would guess that Fox and CNN,</v>

2852
02:09:52.270 --> 02:09:57.270
<v Speaker 2>one of his girls that he used to date </v>
<v Speaker 2>says fucking teeth are all falling out </v>

2853
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:58.300
<v Speaker 2>and then if you see him when he smiles </v>
<v Speaker 2>he smiles like this.</v>

2854
02:09:58.310 --> 02:10:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Like it's Kinda like his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lips are cold,</v>

2855
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:02.140
<v Speaker 2>curled over his teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>

2856
02:10:02.410 --> 02:10:03.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2857
02:10:03.130 --> 02:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>it seems fun when you hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing blow and that's how he rolls </v>

2858
02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:12.721
<v Speaker 2>and he's having hookers and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then at the end of it you realized </v>

2859
02:10:12.721 --> 02:10:12.721
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2860
02:10:12.721 --> 02:10:13.630
<v Speaker 2>this guy is probably like completely out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of control.</v>

2861
02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:18.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably a slave to these chemicals,</v>

2862
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:23.550
<v Speaker 2>but also talented enough that he can </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to make absorb it and </v>

2863
02:10:24.271 --> 02:10:27.970
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money and he has really smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>people behind them because you went from</v>

2864
02:10:27.971 --> 02:10:31.540
<v Speaker 2>that two and a half men show where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>made exorbitant amounts of money to this</v>

2865
02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 2>other show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a terrible show.</v>

2866
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.350
<v Speaker 4>Which one was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To?</v>

2867
02:10:35.630 --> 02:10:37.310
<v Speaker 4>Anger management.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2868
02:10:37.311 --> 02:10:42.311
<v Speaker 4>Terrible Shell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he got an insane deal where they </v>

2869
02:10:42.311 --> 02:10:43.910
<v Speaker 4>filmed all 100 episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really quickly.</v>

2870
02:10:43.911 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 4>And so he made hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>

2871
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:47.990
<v Speaker 4>They were afraid it would end the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traveling.</v>

2872
02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:48.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

2873
02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a thing where you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2874
02:10:51.190 --> 02:10:56.190
<v Speaker 4>it's like a guaranteed syndication deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>where if they did that they would do </v>

2875
02:10:56.190 --> 02:10:58.940
<v Speaker 4>like a 10 90,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way that the show would work.</v>

2876
02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:04.060
<v Speaker 4>Like you would do 13 episodes and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would do the back nine and the back </v>

2877
02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.900
<v Speaker 4>nine would equal 22,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a real season.</v>

2878
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:11.050
<v Speaker 4>So like when we first did news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the first season we did like 13 </v>

2879
02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:11.210
<v Speaker 4>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you get a pickup,</v>

2880
02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.670
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh we got to pick up for the back nine.</v>

2881
02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:18.020
<v Speaker 4>So would they decided to do inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of that was due a 10 90.</v>

2882
02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:23.120
<v Speaker 4>So you do the first 10 episodes and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first 10 episodes go well you get picked</v>

2883
02:11:23.121 --> 02:11:25.040
<v Speaker 4>up for the full hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2884
02:11:25.041 --> 02:11:26.330
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2885
02:11:26.331 --> 02:11:28.550
<v Speaker 4>we've got a hit on our hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's negotiate accordingly.</v>

2886
02:11:28.610 --> 02:11:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got Charlie Sheen,</v>

2887
02:11:30.201 --> 02:11:35.201
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Charlie Sheen was a big part of </v>

2888
02:11:35.201 --> 02:11:37.570
<v Speaker 4>anger or two and a half men made </v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of dollars for the network and </v>

2889
02:11:37.570 --> 02:11:38.720
<v Speaker 4>we can do the same thing for you fx and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>

2890
02:11:38.721 --> 02:11:42.140
<v Speaker 4>they bought hook line and sinker into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this deal and it just fucking went right</v>

2891
02:11:42.141 --> 02:11:46.380
<v Speaker 4>into the shit to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No success whatsoever.</v>

2892
02:11:46.381 --> 02:11:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just that not only talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

2893
02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:53.620
<v Speaker 4>nobody watched it or what to a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>question because I imagine watching the </v>

2894
02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:57.290
<v Speaker 4>beginning watch artist just because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a train wreck about the weapon.</v>

2895
02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was not a bad show at first.</v>

2896
02:12:00.590 --> 02:12:04.060
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those shows where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched it and it got like those.</v>

2897
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.110
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do a good Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2898
02:12:06.111 --> 02:12:11.111
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of good writers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have really good dedicated </v>

2899
02:12:11.111 --> 02:12:14.381
<v Speaker 4>writers that are funny and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have an actor who knows how to pull </v>

2900
02:12:14.381 --> 02:12:15.290
<v Speaker 4>it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a show runner who's got</v>

2901
02:12:15.291 --> 02:12:16.910
<v Speaker 4>experience and putting those things </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2902
02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:20.330
<v Speaker 4>There's an art form to creating a sitcom</v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2903
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:22.040
<v Speaker 4>all itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2904
02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I was on one for five years and I got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see it pretty intimately from a bunch of</v>

2905
02:12:26.751 --> 02:12:31.751
<v Speaker 4>different levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from like the level of like really </v>

2906
02:12:31.751 --> 02:12:34.361
<v Speaker 4>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really smart actors who configure out </v>

2907
02:12:34.361 --> 02:12:38.351
<v Speaker 4>how to manipulate a scene and make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>funny and the level of really smart and </v>

2908
02:12:38.351 --> 02:12:42.851
<v Speaker 4>really good writers who really know how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to craft a scene and then networks with </v>

2909
02:12:42.861 --> 02:12:47.861
<v Speaker 4>good ideas and networks with shit ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you've got to put them all </v>

2910
02:12:47.861 --> 02:12:50.390
<v Speaker 4>together and good luck and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to back then you had to have a good time</v>

2911
02:12:50.391 --> 02:12:50.900
<v Speaker 4>slot to.</v>

2912
02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:54.010
<v Speaker 4>That was a big part of it because Peter </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to know that you were on it.</v>

2913
02:12:54.011 --> 02:12:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Gay Now times have changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2914
02:12:55.671 --> 02:12:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Nobody cares about it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not even an issue,</v>

2915
02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 4>but that's why Netflix has got it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch it whenever you want.</v>

2916
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:04.610
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole season comes out at once.</v>

2917
02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:07.640
<v Speaker 4>That's of photo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best way I can watch seeing.</v>

2918
02:13:07.641 --> 02:13:09.140
<v Speaker 4>So one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one week,</v>

2919
02:13:09.150 --> 02:13:10.010
<v Speaker 4>one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next.</v>

2920
02:13:10.011 --> 02:13:15.011
<v Speaker 4>That to me is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wait for them to be able to just tune </v>

2921
02:13:15.011 --> 02:13:16.120
<v Speaker 4>spoilers out and if I cashed out for gas</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Engine just being donate once it comes </v>

<v Speaker 4>30 days and be done with it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

2932
02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:49.860
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My time is way more valuable than those </v>

2933
02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:53.120
<v Speaker 4>15 minute chunks where you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>interrupt with stupid music and dancing </v>

2934
02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.260
<v Speaker 4>frogs or whatever the fuck is Geico </v>

<v Speaker 4>I saw that one.</v>

2939
02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:10.050

<v Speaker 4>They only did a few episodes,</v>

2940

<v Speaker 4>but it's well really well directed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>well shot show and really well acted d.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the main story of the walking dead or </v>

2945
02:14:26.211 --> 02:14:27.420
<v Speaker 4>something cool characters that you dig,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Very.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they haven't deteriorated enough yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The beginning with the steel looks </v>

2956
02:14:56.570 --> 02:14:58.440
<v Speaker 4>mostly human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like it though.</v>

2957
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it takes time to develop those </v>
<v Speaker 4>characters,</v>

2958
02:15:01.351 --> 02:15:03.930
<v Speaker 4>but like as far as the way it's shot and</v>
<v Speaker 4>acted,</v>

2959
02:15:03.931 --> 02:15:07.740
<v Speaker 4>it seems like it's Daniella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're almost out of time,</v>

2960
02:15:07.741 --> 02:15:09.240
<v Speaker 4>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get the fuck out of here.</v>

2961
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What else is going on?</v>

2962
02:15:10.501 --> 02:15:15.501
<v Speaker 4>What should I tell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell people about history on fire for </v>

2963
02:15:15.501 --> 02:15:15.501
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're amazing podcast.</v>

2964
02:15:15.501 --> 02:15:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my man and you,</v>

2965
02:15:16.621 --> 02:15:21.621
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you opened up first episode with that </v>

2966
02:15:21.621 --> 02:15:21.621
<v Speaker 4>first episode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but episode,</v>

2967
02:15:21.621 --> 02:15:25.640
<v Speaker 4>not zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but episode one was with one of my </v>

2968
02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:27.720
<v Speaker 4>favorite stories you've ever told that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up story about the crucifixions.</v>

2969
02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I feel it's a fucking of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The latest one I think was episode five </v>

2970
02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:34.830
<v Speaker 4>as a story to make it a crucifixion look</v>
<v Speaker 4>like at these Ne Bowlby.</v>

2971
02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:37.050
<v Speaker 4>What is it about a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a story.</v>

2972
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a complicated long story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to go for the essential element,</v>

2973
02:15:40.591 --> 02:15:45.591
<v Speaker 4>there's like these two Persian brothers </v>
<v Speaker 4>were putting sis who are fighting for </v>

2974
02:15:45.591 --> 02:15:49.890
<v Speaker 4>days in the CV of the water for power </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm the mom of both of the guys.</v>

2975
02:15:49.891 --> 02:15:51.600
<v Speaker 4>He speaks to and off them and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>

2976
02:15:51.601 --> 02:15:56.601
<v Speaker 4>And so at one point she's already pissed</v>
<v Speaker 4>off and she wants the guy who actually </v>

2977
02:15:56.601 --> 02:15:59.721
<v Speaker 4>killed their son to be executed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she can't ready to go through a </v>

2978
02:15:59.721 --> 02:15:59.721
<v Speaker 4>rather song and say execute this </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>

2979
02:15:59.721 --> 02:16:02.730
<v Speaker 4>Because he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was obeying and so orders.</v>

2980
02:16:02.731 --> 02:16:05.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she find a way for him to fuck up for</v>

2981
02:16:05.611 --> 02:16:08.870
<v Speaker 4>him to say something that will piss off </v>
<v Speaker 4>or rather than the king.</v>

2982
02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.280
<v Speaker 4>And then the way the execute this </v>
<v Speaker 4>annuity is,</v>

2983
02:16:11.281 --> 02:16:16.281
<v Speaker 4>they put me in a box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we thought he said he saw her Monday </v>

<v Speaker 3>So he has maggots hatching inside of him</v>

<v Speaker 3>method of killing someone that's pretty </v>

2997

2998
02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:05.010
<v Speaker 4>God damn creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at what they did during the </v>

2999
02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:07.701
<v Speaker 4>inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different ways that killed </v>

3000
02:17:07.701 --> 02:17:07.701
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3001
02:17:07.701 --> 02:17:07.701
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>

3002
02:17:07.701 --> 02:17:12.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game of thrones one where they put </v>

3003
02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:14.321
<v Speaker 3>the rat on your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put up late on a light that's a through </v>

3004
02:17:14.321 --> 02:17:14.510
<v Speaker 3>star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like inquisition stuff.</v>

3005
02:17:14.511 --> 02:17:19.511
<v Speaker 3>They did that for real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually just so not all of his </v>

3006
02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:25.770
<v Speaker 3>thrill fireys about crazy stuff that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually some pleasant stories here and </v>

3007
02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:25.770
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3008
02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>of course they weird moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our data as well.</v>

3009
02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 3>There's one that you would dig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the episode three was about the </v>

3010
02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.430
<v Speaker 3>iceman to guide that they found in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alps for 5,000</v>

3011
02:17:37.431 --> 02:17:41.300
<v Speaker 3>years ago and he's kind of like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder mystery because we have found out</v>

3012
02:17:41.301 --> 02:17:46.301
<v Speaker 3>that he was shot with an arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found all these scenes about these </v>

3013
02:17:46.301 --> 02:17:49.001
<v Speaker 3>life and death or some crazy ass details</v>
<v Speaker 3>that archaeology can give us about this </v>

3014
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:51.140
<v Speaker 3>guy's life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he was doing there,</v>

3015
02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:56.150
<v Speaker 3>savvy dance that he may have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>acupuncture 2000 years before it was </v>

3016
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:58.070
<v Speaker 3>ever done in China that were like crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

3017
02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:00.740
<v Speaker 3>But what was the evidence of him doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>acupuncture?</v>

3018
02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Needles?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3019
02:18:01.821 --> 02:18:04.070
<v Speaker 3>they found like these tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not that.</v>

3020
02:18:04.071 --> 02:18:09.071
<v Speaker 3>It was like artistic that they are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>dots and the lines and they roll along </v>

3021
02:18:09.071 --> 02:18:14.001
<v Speaker 3>the acupuncture points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are all alone points where he was </v>

3022
02:18:14.001 --> 02:18:16.931
<v Speaker 3>in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they think that he was kind of some </v>

3023
02:18:16.931 --> 02:18:19.820
<v Speaker 3>form of acupuncture that you would dig </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that spot with needles and then you </v>

3024
02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:23.291
<v Speaker 3>would see late with like possibly like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they do mock trial where they </v>

3025
02:18:23.291 --> 02:18:26.921
<v Speaker 3>burned herb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some bright spots and the leaves that's </v>

3026
02:18:26.921 --> 02:18:26.921
<v Speaker 3>probably out of those attitudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>originated.</v>

3027
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:32.610
<v Speaker 3>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that rewrites history in so </v>

3028
02:18:32.610 --> 02:18:35.831
<v Speaker 3>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some crazy European 2000 years </v>

3029
02:18:35.831 --> 02:18:39.281
<v Speaker 3>before acupuncture was in China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing something very similar to </v>

3030
02:18:39.281 --> 02:18:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Trudet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty Weird in itself.</v>

3031
02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Never mind the whole murder mystery </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of it.</v>

3032
02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3033
02:18:43.711 --> 02:18:48.711
<v Speaker 3>I dig they stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are so many out there in history </v>

3034
02:18:48.711 --> 02:18:51.251
<v Speaker 3>that I have a field agent speaking one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then researching the hell out of it </v>

3035
02:18:51.251 --> 02:18:51.251
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of moments.</v>

3036
02:18:51.330 --> 02:18:52.800
<v Speaker 4>There's another new one that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

3037
02:18:52.801 --> 02:18:57.801
<v Speaker 4>reef rewrites history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've found a mammoth of a dead body </v>

3038
02:18:57.801 --> 02:19:00.960
<v Speaker 4>of a mammoth that had a clear evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of human predation,</v>

3039
02:19:00.961 --> 02:19:05.961
<v Speaker 4>like one of the ribs had been shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think with a spear or something </v>

3040
02:19:05.961 --> 02:19:07.260
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem was it was 45,000</v>

3041
02:19:07.261 --> 02:19:10.170
<v Speaker 4>years old and Siberia and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even know that people were their back.</v>

3042
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:11.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like they got it.</v>

3043
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3044
02:19:13.410 --> 02:19:16.170
<v Speaker 4>I guess we're a little off here with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time too.</v>

3045
02:19:16.171 --> 02:19:18.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just keeps going on and on.</v>

3046
02:19:18.021 --> 02:19:23.021
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the exact specific </v>

3047
02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:23.021
<v Speaker 4>details.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story.</v>

3048
02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:25.170
<v Speaker 4>That's almost the problem with the over </v>
<v Speaker 4>abundance of stories in the Internet.</v>

3049
02:19:25.171 --> 02:19:26.730
<v Speaker 4>You almost get too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3050

<v Speaker 4>They're just coming at you all day.</v>

<v Speaker 4>there wasting time because it's just too</v>

3054

02:20:11.430 --> 02:20:16.271
<v Speaker 4>pump and his ball sack and so the doctor</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his rubber gloves covered in blood </v>

3069
02:20:16.271 --> 02:20:18.410
<v Speaker 4>is squeezing on this guy's balls and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's turned.</v>

3070
02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:20.360
<v Speaker 4>These guys don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3071
02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what liberace had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently he had one of them pumps.</v>

3072
02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:29.980
<v Speaker 4>They put a a like a pump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're pumping your dick up with fluid.</v>

3073
02:20:31.041 --> 02:20:34.550
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's like a fluid in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you hit a button and it releases it</v>

3074
02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:38.920
<v Speaker 4>and your Dick goes flacid again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck and bizarre.</v>

3076
02:20:44.601 --> 02:20:49.601
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't seem like I was disappointed </v>

3077
02:20:49.601 --> 02:20:51.360
<v Speaker 4>because it kind of defeats the purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just.</v>

3078
02:20:51.470 --> 02:20:56.470
<v Speaker 4>It was strange numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these other penis operations that I </v>

3079
02:20:56.470 --> 02:20:56.470

3080
02:20:56.470 --> 02:20:56.810
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do it.</v>
