1
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm tweeting and</v>

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 2>doing this at the same time.</v>

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 2>I just don't feel rushed.</v>

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 2>It smells when you tweets,</v>

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.143
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 2>It really stinks when you do that.</v>

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 2>How do you wait?</v>

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.993
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

9
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Your fingers smell</v>

10
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 2>the magic finger.</v>

11
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.341
<v Speaker 2>Do you have stinky feet?</v>

12
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes,</v>

13
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.421
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

14
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 2>my fingers never stink.</v>

15
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 2>But that would be the weirdest thing,</v>

16
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.001
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

17
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.300
<v Speaker 2>If your fucking fingers stunk,</v>

18
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 3>that would be like a major deal breaker.</v>

19
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird.</v>

20
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 3>You've definitely been with a vagina that smells like an arm pay before,</v>

21
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

22
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

23
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you have some girls don't smell that really touched my vagina.</v>

24
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Smelling and armpit.</v>

25
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 3>You like that be oh,</v>

26
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 3>smells sounds great.</v>

27
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 3>The Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by the fleshlight.</v>

29
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Speaking of Pussy here,</v>

30
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 3>who would you consider it</v>

31
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 2>getting a fleshlight model of your vagina if they offered you a tidy sum,</v>

32
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I would do it for 15 minutes at at the Improv.</v>

33
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.731
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>

34
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to Joe rogan.net.</v>

35
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 3>Click on the link for the flashlight.</v>

36
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Linda the code name Rogan,</v>

37
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 2>and you'll save yourself 15% of the number one sex toy from my,</v>

38
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking solid product.</v>

39
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

40
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.391
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why.</v>

41
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing will ever say we're in the middle of,</v>

42
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker 2>taken out some new sponsors.</v>

44
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing will ever sell on the show that we don't believe in it.</v>

45
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's something I believe,</v>

46
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 3>start sowing the improv.com then Joe,</v>

47
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 3>because that is the best comedy club ever in a 15 minute spot for Amy Schumer to</v>

48
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 3>become a fleshlight mold.</v>

49
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like an awesome idea.</v>

50
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.871
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

51
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:23.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

52
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 3>the emperor's,</v>

53
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to say if you want to go with like a solid chain of comedy clubs,</v>

54
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.101
<v Speaker 3>don't do it for free.</v>

55
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 3>At least the number one comedy chain across the country.</v>

56
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a strong move.</v>

57
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I had a great domain.</v>

58
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.613
<v Speaker 3>They do it right.</v>

59
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 2>they do it right everywhere.</v>

61
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 2>We just did the Improv in Louisville was fucking awesome.</v>

62
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

63
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>it was the shit.</v>

64
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:44.331
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>

66
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Every improv is just solid as a rock.</v>

67
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>They know what the fuck they're doing and every time I should be happy that</v>

68
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they're around,</v>

69
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 2>but not as good as the Pasadena Ice House.</v>

70
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 2>It was a browser and ice house.</v>

71
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.611
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

72
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 2>they're all awesome.</v>

73
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I love the Improv.</v>

74
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I love this place.</v>

75
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

76
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 2>little comedy clubs like that.</v>

78
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 2>We could support it and we're helping support it with this podcast.</v>

79
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:01.271
<v Speaker 2>Actually this,</v>

80
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>this podcast actually makes the club money,</v>

81
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 2>so it's nice.</v>

82
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.361
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

83
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>we do shows here and we pay them rent.</v>

84
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 3>This place is booming lately,</v>

85
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:09.291
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

86
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Mark Marin's has been here lately.</v>

87
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Great Club.</v>

88
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 3>It's been here since</v>

89
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 2>19 fucking 50 or something crazy like that.</v>

90
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like Europe.</v>

92
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>This isn't sane for real.</v>

93
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I do believe it.</v>

94
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it just celebrated its 50th anniversary.</v>

95
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.061
<v Speaker 2>Not Kidding.</v>

96
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 2>So I was exaggerating,</v>

97
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:25.914
<v Speaker 2>but only slightly.</v>

98
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

99
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:28.434
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

100
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.413
<v Speaker 2>Is that the goal?</v>

101
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.443
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

102
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

103
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

104
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 2>we're also sponsored by on at.com on it is a,</v>

106
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 2>a maker of a bunch of different nutritional supplements,</v>

107
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 2>most notably Alpha brain.</v>

108
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 2>That's one that I get mine.</v>

109
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I took two of them right before we do the show.</v>

110
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I take them all the time.</v>

111
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Every time I want to do a set,</v>

112
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I take them if I have anything where we need to form coherent sentences and not</v>

113
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 2>stumble over my words like a retard,</v>

114
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I take them.</v>

115
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it works.</v>

116
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 2>If you want to find out about it,</v>

117
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.350
<v Speaker 2>go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t and Google nootropics.</v>

118
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a very fascinating subject,</v>

119
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 2>pros and cons against.</v>

120
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

121
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 2>one thing I will tell you about on it,</v>

122
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 2>when you order something,</v>

123
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>the first order your 30 pill bottle,</v>

124
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you have a 100% money back guarantee.</v>

125
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to return it.</v>

126
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>You can eat it all and say it sucks.</v>

127
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I want my money back and you get 100% of your money back.</v>

128
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.953
<v Speaker 2>So that is to,</v>

129
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>to try to let people know that the last thing we're trying to do is rip anybody</v>

130
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.664
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

131
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Making money is second to making sure that no one feels ripped off.</v>

132
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 2>These are all supplements that I use and I have used before I ever in endorsed</v>

133
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:32.591
<v Speaker 2>this company.</v>

134
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I use them independently.</v>

135
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

136
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 2>especially the,</v>

138
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the contents and Alpha brain,</v>

139
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>not so much a shroom tech sport and shroom tech immune,</v>

140
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>which are really fascinating.</v>

141
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Shroom tech sport being one that actually enhances your body's absorption of</v>

142
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.300
<v Speaker 2>oxygen,</v>

143
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>gives you a little bit more endurance and it's got to be 12 in it,</v>

144
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:53.130
<v Speaker 2>which also gives you a little bit more endurance both of those together.</v>

145
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a great combination.</v>

146
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's based on the quarter steps mushroom,</v>

147

<v Speaker 2>Tell me what you were doing that after the music ready.</v>

162
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:24.261
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

163
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:24.531
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

164

<v Speaker 2>And Amy Schumer's,</v>

166
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 4>that was the worst DJ mix a lot.</v>

167
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I have a whole new set up today.</v>

168
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:38.070
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't give him practice.</v>

169
00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 4>He only does it when we're live on air.</v>

170
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 3>That's when he learns what it does.</v>

171
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.713
<v Speaker 3>What does this one do?</v>

172
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

173
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm using all new equipment today.</v>

174
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Well you were giggling about before,</v>

175
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 3>are you early?</v>

176
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

177
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you were saying if you can't cope with altitude,</v>

178
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.300
<v Speaker 3>that helped take one of those pills.</v>

180
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.310
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking of about being really high up going,</v>

181
00:04:58.311 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I can't cope with this and going,</v>

182
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 3>oh here's some new new mood.</v>

183
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh it feels scattered.</v>

184
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it would work.</v>

185
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.760
<v Speaker 2>You will never know because yeah,</v>

186
00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:08.111
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

187
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:10.730
<v Speaker 2>when you get too high and then if you took something,</v>

188
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 2>how would you know if you just got over being high or if the stuff took it down</v>

189
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:16.784
<v Speaker 2>a notch,</v>

190
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you would have to,</v>

191
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be super experienced,</v>

192
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

193
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.633
<v Speaker 2>And there's also like,</v>

194
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.950
<v Speaker 2>you know how,</v>

195
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.930
<v Speaker 2>how much time had you taken off between that session and the last session?</v>

196
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Because if you just take like five,</v>

197
00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:30.740
<v Speaker 2>six days off and then reset yourself,</v>

198
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.001
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

199
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you can get yourself scary high.</v>

200
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.441
<v Speaker 2>You can get,</v>

201
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

203
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.050
<v Speaker 2>like we don't realize if you get high every day that you kind of build this like</v>

204
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:41.960
<v Speaker 2>weird acceptance and tolerance for the high state.</v>

205
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.120
<v Speaker 2>But if you step off for five,</v>

206
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 2>six days a week or so,</v>

207
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.313
<v Speaker 3>do you really?</v>

208
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh sorry.</v>

209
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't my idea.</v>

210
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I told you we just do what your instincts tell you.</v>

211
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Do your instincts tell you like I just got out of the hospital.</v>

212
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:58.821
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>

213
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 3>your friends are doing it.</v>

214
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I did not say that.</v>

215
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 3>It never said it that way.</v>

216
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>The kid was begging for weed.</v>

217
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

218

220
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.541
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

222
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:11.841
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>

223
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 3>I'd just get out the hospital.</v>

224
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 3>You guys were like,</v>

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 3>this will answer your prayers.</v>

227
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.150

292
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:46.631
<v Speaker 3>Doctor said,</v>

293
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:47.291
<v Speaker 3>had I not come in,</v>

294
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I would have been uncomfortable for another 10 minutes now.</v>

295
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

296
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 3>it's good that you came in with diarrhea.</v>

297
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

298
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is when you're that dehydrated,</v>

299
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.350
<v Speaker 5>you can't drink water.</v>

300
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.161
<v Speaker 5>You just puke.</v>

303
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.771
<v Speaker 5>sneak it in,</v>

304

305
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.870
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

306
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 5>the woman next to me was so much worse than me.</v>

307
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:06.790
<v Speaker 5>I felt bad for being there when she was like,</v>

308
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:07.541
<v Speaker 5>I never saw her,</v>

309
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 5>but she sounded like an old black woman.</v>

310
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.750
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

311
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.030
<v Speaker 5>she was like puking and praying.</v>

312
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.223
<v Speaker 5>So she was like,</v>

313
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Speaker 5>like this weird kind of,</v>

314
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.751
<v Speaker 5>and then she's being like,</v>

315
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 5>don't turn your back on me Lord.</v>

440
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.250
<v Speaker 7>frying up some Connie Assata and you're like,</v>

441
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:19.911

00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:21.950

445
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.770
<v Speaker 7>The all those smells together.</v>

446
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:25.161
<v Speaker 7>Just,</v>

447
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:25.994
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

448
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 7>that's when you go to a restaurant,</v>

449
00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:27.951
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

450
00:11:27.951 --> 00:11:28.281
<v Speaker 7>you don't,</v>

451
00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:31.610
<v Speaker 7>you don't get to like walk right by where the food is cooked in that close.</v>

452
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.200
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

453
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 7>And you're walking by a truck,</v>

454
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:35.330
<v Speaker 7>you're like 15 feet away from that food.</v>

455
00:11:35.331 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 7>It's cooking.</v>

456
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 7>It's too real for you.</v>

457
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 7>It's too much reality.</v>

458
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.180
<v Speaker 7>Feel it in my bones.</v>

459
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.670
<v Speaker 7>I think it's cool though.</v>

460
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.320
<v Speaker 7>I think it's cool that they can be like,</v>

461
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.950
<v Speaker 7>they can make like really cool food and they don't have to pay rent somewhere.</v>

462
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:51.230
<v Speaker 7>Then you have to get a truck one time investment.</v>

463
00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 7>Then tweaked to people where they're going to be.</v>

464
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.471
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

465
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>

00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 3>like you have to get the word.</v>

468
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.070

527
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:50.441
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

528
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:51.540
<v Speaker 3>this is the artificial mom</v>

529
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 3>and she won for real.</v>

530
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 3>She's so cool cause that's the only thing.</v>

531
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.870
<v Speaker 3>The only rule she has for me.</v>

532
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about everything.</v>

533
00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Like I talk about her vagina,</v>

534
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 3>everything on stage,</v>

535
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.111
<v Speaker 3>but I won't,</v>

536
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:05.531
<v Speaker 3>but she's like,</v>

537
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 3>just don't call me a cunt if I'm there.</v>

538
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

539
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 3>so what I say is I'll be like my mom's here at night and I promised I wasn't</v>

540
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 3>going to call her and I'm not going to and she's still after the show.</v>

541
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

542
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 3>thank you for not doing it.</v>

543
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

544
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.851
<v Speaker 3>you're the best.</v>

545
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:22.684
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

546
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.551
<v Speaker 3>Now she's pretty,</v>

547
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>she's pretty cool with letting me talk about whatever.</v>

548
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the coolest things about having friends that are comedians and you</v>

549
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:30.710
<v Speaker 3>could actually say that your mother might be,</v>

550
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 3>oh my God and nothing or no comedian even flinches.</v>

551
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I remember you did a roast and you said something about a Patricia's</v>

552
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:39.454
<v Speaker 3>grandmothers.</v>

553
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was so funny because I knew that you guys were friends.</v>

554
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

555
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Favorite joke to say.</v>

556
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 3>It was really funny.</v>

557
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Silvermen wrote to me after that was like after Gospel Brunch,</v>

558
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 8>like that was her fear was like,</v>

559
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.450
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>

560
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.440
<v Speaker 8>that was a site.</v>

561
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 8>It was just so silly that you did it.</v>

562
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:01.660
<v Speaker 8>And it was so much like a bunch of comedians sitting round talking shit to me.</v>

563
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 8>I mean that is completely something that Brian would say if you were eating</v>

564
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:05.350
<v Speaker 8>breakfast,</v>

565
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

566
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.051
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

567
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:08.470
<v Speaker 8>When I fucked your mother's brown dirty ass holes</v>

568
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 8>were so you see each other that then when we're out in the world,</v>

569
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.391
<v Speaker 8>I forget,</v>

570
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 8>like last night I went up to the roof of my hotel and I looked around,</v>

571
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 8>I came out to the front and the host goes,</v>

572
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.493
<v Speaker 8>he was like,</v>

573
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:22.281
<v Speaker 8>he's like,</v>

574
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 8>do you come in the back door?</v>

575
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 8>And I was like,</v>

576
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.680
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>

577
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 8>And he was like the back door.</v>

578
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 8>And I was like,</v>

579
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.651
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

580
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 8>are you making like an anal joke?</v>

581
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:29.931
<v Speaker 8>And he was like,</v>

582
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:30.764
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

583
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:31.603
<v Speaker 8>Like what?</v>

584
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 8>And I was just like,</v>

585
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

586
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.070
<v Speaker 8>and it was off a moment,</v>

587
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.493
<v Speaker 8>but I'm like,</v>

588
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.190
<v Speaker 8>I'm not used to talking to people that that wouldn't be okay to say that in</v>

589
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 8>front of me.</v>

590
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 8>So imagine if that's the first words.</v>

591
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:45.900
<v Speaker 8>That dude says the back door.</v>

592
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.343
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

593
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.381
<v Speaker 8>all right.</v>

594
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:48.741
<v Speaker 8>And he's like,</v>

595
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:49.550
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

596
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.910
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

597
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.743
<v Speaker 8>oh right.</v>

598
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.783
<v Speaker 8>I'm discussing.</v>

599
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 8>That was his hustle.</v>

600
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 8>Maybe it works.</v>

601
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:55.334
<v Speaker 8>Maybe worse.</v>

602
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 8>I would probably be that girl.</v>

603
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 8>This guy knows what he wants.</v>

604
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.820
<v Speaker 8>This guy's a go getter and there,</v>

605
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 8>boy,</v>

606
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.013
<v Speaker 8>I could see it.</v>

607
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.983
<v Speaker 8>You can see it.</v>

608
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.761
<v Speaker 8>But now he was like,</v>

609
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:08.594
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

610
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

611
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.160
<v Speaker 8>it's tough.</v>

612
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

613
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 8>It's just tough to like be with normal people.</v>

614
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

615
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 8>People get mad when we call a regular folks civilians.</v>

616
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.460
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

617
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 8>Probably.</v>

618
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.520
<v Speaker 8>That probably is a disrespect to [inaudible].</v>

619
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.220
<v Speaker 8>We were calling them civilians before the war.</v>

620
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.881
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

621
00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 8>I always called them civilians.</v>

622
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:30.950
<v Speaker 8>We call them siblings in the 80s when were worn at war and there had been no</v>

623
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 8>wars yet in the eighties no,</v>

624
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.620
<v Speaker 8>it never had happened.</v>

625
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 8>All the other wars had been artificial ones.</v>

626
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:36.981
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

627
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:37.461
<v Speaker 8>The ones that,</v>

628
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.294
<v Speaker 8>like you said,</v>

629
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 8>the conspiracy theories,</v>

630
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 8>zero wars until this last one.</v>

631
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.521
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

632
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:48.521
<v Speaker 8>could you imagine if you could get a culture and take everyone from like age</v>

633
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.100
<v Speaker 8>five and below,</v>

634
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.200
<v Speaker 8>take them and kill everyone else.</v>

635
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 8>So you take all the babies and all the really young kids don't really know what</v>

636
00:16:57.681 --> 00:17:01.880
<v Speaker 8>the fuck is going on yet and then he'd just give him a totally fake history.</v>

637
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.910
<v Speaker 8>CGI,</v>

638
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 8>old writing.</v>

639
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 8>Everybody has their prepared and that's how the Illuminati really take over the</v>

640
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>

641
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 8>What they do is they kill everybody but babies up to like four after four,</v>

642
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:18.020
<v Speaker 8>you'd probably have some memories of some shit that went down,</v>

643
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

644
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 8>But I think what you're describing is like what actually without killing people,</v>

645
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.720
<v Speaker 8>like that's what actually happens.</v>

646
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 8>Like everyone's just raised with to ton of lies.</v>

647
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.060
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

648
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.030
<v Speaker 8>There's a little of that and they're just like unfolding it.</v>

649
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:29.780
<v Speaker 8>As you get older,</v>

650
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>

651
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.201
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

652
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 8>that was all horse shit.</v>

653
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:32.151
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

654
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:37.151
<v Speaker 8>But I think that if you want it to like really recreate a history,</v>

655
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 8>like create a false history,</v>

656
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 8>I think it's possible to do.</v>

657
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 8>I mean it sounds completely ridiculous,</v>

658
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 8>but if you were in a situation,</v>

659
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 8>like if it was like after an asteroid hit and a bunch of people</v>

660
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 7>were killed and there was,</v>

661
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 7>there was very little resources left and then someone decided we're going to</v>

662
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 7>kill everybody but the children and we're going to start society again with a</v>

663
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 7>fake history that I made up.</v>

664
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

665
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 7>Which is essentially like with Joseph Smith,</v>

666
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.643
<v Speaker 7>he made up a fake</v>

667
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.530
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

668
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

669
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.670
<v Speaker 5>Created the Mormons.</v>

670
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.201
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

671
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:08.170
<v Speaker 5>Write that shit works.</v>

672
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.050
<v Speaker 5>They had a whole state and they're all like so nice and good looking nice.</v>

673
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.590
<v Speaker 5>What's the problem I heard are the f I went to him</v>

674
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.960
<v Speaker 7>Mormon funeral recently and it was the nicest friendliest</v>

675
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.281
<v Speaker 5>were you,</v>

676
00:18:18.281 --> 00:18:19.114
<v Speaker 5>you were allowed in,</v>

677
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.720
<v Speaker 5>I thought to be allowed in that church you had to be more a,</v>

678
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:22.901
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

679
00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:23.860
<v Speaker 5>they were UFC fans,</v>

680
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.400
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>

681
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.290
<v Speaker 3>It's all bets are off zero.</v>

682
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Syrians has the religious people were like,</v>

683
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.760
<v Speaker 3>they really love what you just</v>

684
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.693
<v Speaker 3>made that up.</v>

685
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 3>So the real answer is,</v>

686
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:40.361
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

687

692
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 7>Their family is Mormon.</v>

693
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 7>So they did an alarming thing.</v>

694
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

695
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

729
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:35.961
<v Speaker 7>when someone comes up and uses that time to talk about them and talk about their</v>

730
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:43.410
<v Speaker 7>relationship and how good a friend they were like justifying themselves about,</v>

731
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.681
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

732
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:44.060
<v Speaker 7>to this</v>

733
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.451
<v Speaker 5>daddy.</v>

734
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:48.890
<v Speaker 5>Most people have at least a moment of that in their speech at funerals.</v>

735
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.131
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

736
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:49.341
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

737
00:19:49.341 --> 00:19:51.530
<v Speaker 5>I've only seen people I've seen,</v>

738
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.510
<v Speaker 5>well actually I like,</v>

739
00:19:53.511 --> 00:19:54.710
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about it like it's a set,</v>

740
00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:55.340
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

741
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.551
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

742
00:19:55.551 --> 00:19:58.850
<v Speaker 5>I've Seen Collin Quinn speak at two funerals and he does not do that,</v>

743
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.760
<v Speaker 5>but I think he's the only person I've ever seen that doesn't even have a moment</v>

744
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:01.971
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

745
00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:03.280
<v Speaker 5>it's about the cones</v>

746
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.130
<v Speaker 7>where,</v>

747
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>

748
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.040
<v Speaker 7>that's why he's so funny and so smart.</v>

749
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.140
<v Speaker 7>And so she's so observant,</v>

750
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:10.820
<v Speaker 7>picks things up.</v>

751
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.511
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

752
00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:11.930
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

753
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.340
<v Speaker 7>what I was saying about this,</v>

754
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.650
<v Speaker 7>this funerals that no one did that.</v>

755
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.301
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

756
00:20:16.301 --> 00:20:16.780
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

757
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 5>It was really about the person.</v>

758
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.681
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

759
00:20:18.681 --> 00:20:19.371
<v Speaker 7>none of that.</v>

760
00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:20.204
<v Speaker 7>There was no,</v>

761
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:25.010
<v Speaker 7>cause the last funeral I had been to him was a Hollywood type affair and I swear</v>

762
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:30.011
<v Speaker 7>a guy went up that knew the dead person for fucking like three months or</v>

763
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:30.710
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

764
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 7>And somehow or another he got on the podium and was like way over doing it and</v>

765
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:36.561
<v Speaker 7>connecting.</v>

766
00:20:36.561 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 7>This guy's a funeral with the reason why the son was in a certain position in</v>

767
00:20:41.391 --> 00:20:44.180
<v Speaker 7>the sky and the clouds had parted and I knew it was him.</v>

768
00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:44.961
<v Speaker 7>It was him talking.</v>

769
00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:45.794
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

770
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 5>fucking get off that podium.</v>

771
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.601
<v Speaker 8>Stupid.</v>

772
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:50.480
<v Speaker 8>Fuck you can.</v>

773
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.720
<v Speaker 8>He's the sun through the clouds.</v>

774
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:54.170
<v Speaker 8>You Retard off.</v>

775
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 8>How dare you.</v>

776
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 8>How dare you make me listen to your nonsense at us.</v>

777
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 8>Sit here and listen to this stupid fucking meandering bullshit is poorly thought</v>

778
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 8>out.</v>

779
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 8>How much more offensive at a funeral,</v>

780
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 8>you are the worst human.</v>

781
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 8>And then the guy used it to announce the fucking opening of his movie.</v>

782
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

783
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:09.980
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

786
00:21:10.911 --> 00:21:15.911
<v Speaker 8>He said tried to claim that this guy's death coincided somehow with the opening</v>

787
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:17.201
<v Speaker 8>of his movie.</v>

00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 7>we knew the dude pretty well and we were sitting there.</v>

797
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:29.740
<v Speaker 7>It was me and three of my friends who knew him when we were just going,</v>

798
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:30.530

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.843

<v Speaker 8>When the sun part it through those clouds,</v>

<v Speaker 8>that was him talking to me.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Why wouldn't you just talk to you?</v>

813
00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.780
<v Speaker 8>He can use his magic to make the clouds and the sun move.</v>

814
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.470
<v Speaker 8>He can make the sun in a certain position and push the clouds away.</v>

815
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.161
<v Speaker 8>She can do that,</v>

816
00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:07.880
<v Speaker 8>but he can't just send you like an email or mail from beyond the grave.</v>

817
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.811
<v Speaker 8>Hey Dude,</v>

818
00:22:08.811 --> 00:22:09.441
<v Speaker 8>I'm dead.</v>

00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:10.191

820
00:22:10.191 --> 00:22:11.120
<v Speaker 8>I'm in heaven now.</v>

821
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.160
<v Speaker 8>Would it be so hard to send a fucking email?</v>

822
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.431
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

<v Speaker 8>you got to like move trees and shit.</v>

824
00:22:15.081 --> 00:22:15.914
<v Speaker 8>What are you going to do?</v>

825
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.310
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

826
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.680
<v Speaker 8>you've got to cause a lightning bolt to land on people.</v>

827
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.570
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever had to give one of his speeches though?</v>

828
00:22:20.571 --> 00:22:21.330
<v Speaker 8>Those speeches?</v>

829
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.163
<v Speaker 8>Socks,</v>

830
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.200
<v Speaker 8>you have shit and it's so gross.</v>

831
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.043
<v Speaker 8>The the dollar.</v>

832
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.750
<v Speaker 8>It's not yourself.</v>

833
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.830
<v Speaker 8>It's not your everyday person.</v>

834
00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 8>You have to almost play a character where you're overdoing almost.</v>

835
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.140
<v Speaker 8>It's harder for Comedians I think.</v>

836
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

837
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.710
<v Speaker 7>Well I dunno.</v>

838
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Speaker 7>I just cried and said some shit that I believed I did.</v>

839
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.021
<v Speaker 7>I didn't,</v>

840
00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:39.854
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

841
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.210
<v Speaker 7>I didn't write anything out.</v>

842
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.690
<v Speaker 7>I felt like if I wrote anything out then it would just sound like horse shit.</v>

843
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.400
<v Speaker 7>I just tried to say as,</v>

844
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.940
<v Speaker 7>as as much about the person that affected me,</v>

845
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

846
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.021
<v Speaker 7>what's,</v>

847
00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:53.900
<v Speaker 7>what's positive about them and then we just go,</v>

848
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

849
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.760
<v Speaker 7>cherish our time.</v>

850
00:22:55.761 --> 00:22:56.091
<v Speaker 7>It's so,</v>

851
00:22:56.091 --> 00:23:00.290
<v Speaker 7>it's so difficult to think about the fact that your time is not,</v>

852
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.741
<v Speaker 7>it's not,</v>

853
00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:01.820
<v Speaker 7>it's not permanent.</v>

854
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.910
<v Speaker 7>You are only going to get a little bit of this shit and you could waste it.</v>

855
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.511
<v Speaker 7>You can waste sue.</v>

856
00:23:05.511 --> 00:23:06.380
<v Speaker 7>It's shitty thoughts.</v>

857
00:23:06.381 --> 00:23:07.430
<v Speaker 7>You could waste it with,</v>

858
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.990
<v Speaker 7>with doing the wrong thing.</v>

859
00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:11.520
<v Speaker 7>You can raced it with bad energy and it,</v>

860
00:23:11.521 --> 00:23:14.690
<v Speaker 7>sometimes it takes like a death for us to realize that I don't like going to</v>

861
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.620
<v Speaker 7>funerals anymore.</v>

862
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.461
<v Speaker 7>I don't like it.</v>

863
00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:19.940
<v Speaker 7>I don't like the feeling of being around a bunch of people who are mourning.</v>

864
00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:20.661
<v Speaker 7>I don't like it.</v>

865
00:23:20.661 --> 00:23:21.230
<v Speaker 7>I like,</v>

866
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.920
<v Speaker 7>there's been a few people that died comics especially where I'm like,</v>

867
00:23:24.921 --> 00:23:28.490
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to be around all my friends that are also fellow comedians and sit</v>

868
00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 7>around and cry and about,</v>

869
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.260
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to do that in her life.</v>

870
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.560
<v Speaker 5>I think it's harder seeing comedians upset and maybe it's just cause I'm closer</v>

871
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:35.891
<v Speaker 5>to them,</v>

872
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

873
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 5>but seeing like those guys that I'm close to,</v>

874
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 5>like when they're sad,</v>

875
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:41.551
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

876
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

877
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.200
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

878
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 5>it feels so much worse,</v>

879
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.321
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

880
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

881
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.261
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>

882
00:23:45.261 --> 00:23:45.711
<v Speaker 5>it also,</v>

883
00:23:45.711 --> 00:23:45.921
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

884
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

885
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

886
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the funerals,</v>

887
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:51.680
<v Speaker 5>but then hanging out after and talking with them and just telling stories</v>

888
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 5>because that's what we would all want it if I,</v>

889
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 5>if I died when I die,</v>

890
00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:56.534
<v Speaker 5>I want,</v>

891
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.970
<v Speaker 5>I want people to tell,</v>

892
00:23:57.971 --> 00:23:58.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

893
00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.660
<v Speaker 5>the most fucked up shit that I did.</v>

894
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

895
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.141
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

896
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 5>you want people sitting around like,</v>

897
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

898
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.840
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget when he did this and went right because that's what we would</v>

899
00:24:05.841 --> 00:24:06.021
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

900
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:06.854
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

901
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 5>it's also a good opportunity to just like celebrate the shit out of that</v>

902
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 5>person's life and tell every story.</v>

903
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

904
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:13.694
<v Speaker 5>there was like a,</v>

905
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.601
<v Speaker 5>at least with them,</v>

906
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 5>with Patrice and a Geraldo,</v>

907
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:16.511

<v Speaker 5>like a good number of nights in a row where everyone just was going around just</v>

910
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 5>nonstop and it felt really therapeutic and like what they would have wanted.</v>

911
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.500
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

912
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.333
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to,</v>

913
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 5>they want people to be upset of course.</v>

914
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:28.671
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

915
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:28.881
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

916
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:32.810
<v Speaker 5>just talk about maybe some stories and nobody ever heard that.</v>

917
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:33.644

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 8>Zero apologies.</v>

1019
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.773
<v Speaker 8>Zero.</v>

1020
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't give a shit.</v>

1021
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 8>That's a really original thing and it's like just,</v>

1022
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 8>and he's not really,</v>

1023
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:45.570
<v Speaker 8>isn't it?</v>

1024
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.800
<v Speaker 8>What the original is at Norton?</v>

1025
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.970
<v Speaker 8>I don't think Eddie Izzard a sex with trainees,</v>

1026
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:55.080
<v Speaker 8>but he like that's pretty bad ass to where did he do standup in drag?</v>

1027
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.771
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1028
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 8>I think that was more of a gimmick than anything cause I don't even think you</v>

1029
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:01.420
<v Speaker 8>discussed it and now I don't talking about it.</v>

1030
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 8>but I mean he didn't discuss the fact that he was wearing women's clothes.</v>

1032
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.181
<v Speaker 8>I don't think so.</v>

1033
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:08.580
<v Speaker 8>I think he just went on and I could be mistaken.</v>

1034
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.780
<v Speaker 8>Someone will correct me on Twitter by sure.</v>

1035
00:28:10.781 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

1036
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.640
<v Speaker 8>that was the thing was that he would just go on stage and do his whole act dress</v>

1037
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 8>like a woman just like to freak people out or call attention to himself.</v>

1038
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 8>I used to,</v>

1039
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 8>didn't used to think that,</v>

1040
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:21.391
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1041
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:22.680
<v Speaker 8>I didn't think about that guy.</v>

1042
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 8>Positive or negative until I watched some documentary about him wanting all the</v>

1043
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 8>way across the UK.</v>

1044
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:29.731
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

1045
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:30.564
<v Speaker 8>It was insane.</v>

1046
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.051
<v Speaker 8>He's,</v>

1047
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 8>the fucking gun wasn't even in shape and he did like a marathon a day.</v>

1048
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 8>He did like 26 miles every day and his feet were falling apart and massive</v>

1049
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 8>blisters and everything was open uninfected and he just would tape it up and the</v>

1050
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 8>next day brought a fucking marathon.</v>

1051
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 8>It's a special kind of crazy right there.</v>

1052
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.391

1134
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:41.970
<v Speaker 8>terrible movie.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Nah,</v>

1140
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 8>I think this was before Tommy Lee was famous.</v>

1141
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.170
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1142
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.090
<v Speaker 8>back then Tommy Lee was still in motley crew,</v>

1143
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.933
<v Speaker 8>but better.</v>

1144
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>James old draws.</v>

1146
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:58.650
<v Speaker 8>A lot of good people are in it.</v>

1147
00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.170
<v Speaker 8>Am I wrong?</v>

1148
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 8>There's the eighties token hot chick with the 80s there's a bunch of respectable</v>

1149
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 8>actors in this movie is one of the reasons why it's such a hunk of shit all the</v>

1150
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:07.811
<v Speaker 8>time.</v>

1151
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 8>Gold medal winner and heart and soul of the Korean team.</v>

1152
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.610
<v Speaker 8>This guy went on to open a Holy Spirit</v>

1153
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.483
<v Speaker 6>restaurant.</v>

1154
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 8>Korean barbecue.</v>

1155
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 8>Perhaps this guy's a knocking it off the charts.</v>

1156
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 8>This isn't a scene with Eric Roberts,</v>

1157
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:25.414
<v Speaker 8>unfortunately,</v>

1158
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 8>because these guys probably actually know martial arts.</v>

1159
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 8>Watching Eric.</v>

1160

1197
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.240
<v Speaker 6>I haven't touched weed three days.</v>

1198
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:11.451
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:12.620
<v Speaker 6>you're so strong.</v>

1200
00:32:12.621 --> 00:32:13.071
<v Speaker 6>I don't think,</v>

1201
00:32:13.071 --> 00:32:14.450
<v Speaker 6>I mean pain right now.</v>

1202
00:32:14.451 --> 00:32:15.320
<v Speaker 6>There is wrong.</v>

1203
00:32:15.321 --> 00:32:15.861
<v Speaker 6>Eric,</v>

1204
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:18.470
<v Speaker 6>you don't think I'm a hurt on the inside right now.</v>

1205
00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.550
<v Speaker 6>Don't turn your back on me,</v>

1206
00:32:19.551 --> 00:32:20.150
<v Speaker 6>Lord.</v>

1207
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.500
<v Speaker 8>It became some weird therapeutic thing where he,</v>

1208
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.610
<v Speaker 8>he had his stepson and his stepson came on the show.</v>

1209
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

1210
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.520
<v Speaker 8>Steps.</v>

1211
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.040
<v Speaker 8>I hated him for how he treated them.</v>

1212
00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:31.310
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

1213
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.920
<v Speaker 8>Oh God damn too much.</v>

1214
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:35.481
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1215
00:32:35.481 --> 00:32:35.721
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1216
00:32:35.721 --> 00:32:36.471
<v Speaker 8>you realize,</v>

1217
00:32:36.471 --> 00:32:36.951
<v Speaker 8>and this is,</v>

1218
00:32:36.951 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 8>this is a reality of a lot of,</v>

1219
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 8>there's a reason why a lot of</v>

1220
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

1221
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 7>famous people's kids become crazy.</v>

1222
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.740
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 7>It's because when you're like a movie star,</v>

1224
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 7>you go places for months at a time.</v>

1225
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.760
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1226
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1227
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 7>if you're Eric Roberts,</v>

1228
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1229
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 7>I guarantee you that guy had to go places when that guy was a kid.</v>

1230
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:54.321
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1231
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if he took his family with him.</v>

1232
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how he rocked it,</v>

1233
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 7>but a lot of people just go places.</v>

1234
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 7>I know folks that leave their family behind for months.</v>

1235
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.630
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that's how it used to be.</v>

1236
00:33:03.631 --> 00:33:04.021
<v Speaker 3>Even now,</v>

1237
00:33:04.021 --> 00:33:05.850
<v Speaker 3>everybody's so aware and sensitive.</v>

1238
00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that shit still happens.</v>

1239
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.790
<v Speaker 3>It still happens for sure.</v>

1240
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.980
<v Speaker 7>I think it happened a lot though,</v>

1242
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.873
<v Speaker 7>back in the day.</v>

1243
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean you look,</v>

1244
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:12.961
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot,</v>

1245
00:33:12.961 --> 00:33:13.141
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1246
00:33:13.141 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to name any names because I'm not trying to,</v>

1247
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:15.461
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1248
00:33:15.461 --> 00:33:16.630
<v Speaker 3>like who are you talking about?</v>

1249
00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking at it objectively.</v>

1250
00:33:20.251 --> 00:33:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

1251
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.720
<v Speaker 7>when you look at all these famous kids love,</v>

1252
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.960
<v Speaker 7>see you like people who were famous in the 70s and the Andes and then the kids</v>

1253
00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 7>become adults and complete fuck ups.</v>

1254
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.730
<v Speaker 7>There's a God damn laundry list to them.</v>

1255
00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:31.510
<v Speaker 7>It's a big,</v>

1256
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.560
<v Speaker 7>almost all of them.</v>

1257
00:33:32.561 --> 00:33:33.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1258
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.060
<v Speaker 7>it's incredible.</v>

1259
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.380
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:34.900
<v Speaker 7>So you gotta,</v>

1261
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.430
<v Speaker 7>you gotta think like what?</v>

1262
00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.450
<v Speaker 7>What happened there?</v>

1263
00:33:37.451 --> 00:33:38.740
<v Speaker 7>How did this go wrong?</v>

1264
00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.570
<v Speaker 7>What w how can this be avoided?</v>

1265
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:41.171
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1266
00:33:41.171 --> 00:33:41.411
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1267
00:33:41.411 --> 00:33:41.801
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>

1268
00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:42.590
<v Speaker 7>this is a,</v>

1269
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.200
<v Speaker 7>there's something's going wrong here.</v>

1270
00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:45.250
<v Speaker 7>And then the mechanism of,</v>

1271
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.470
<v Speaker 7>of raising a human under the,</v>

1272
00:33:47.471 --> 00:33:48.040
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1273
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.873
<v Speaker 7>this job,</v>

1274
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.600
<v Speaker 7>but what is it?</v>

1275
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.800
<v Speaker 7>Is it the distance,</v>

1276
00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:51.611
<v Speaker 7>the time away?</v>

1277
00:33:51.611 --> 00:33:54.340
<v Speaker 7>Is it the unfair and weird treatment that you can,</v>

1278
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:54.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1279
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Just having a parent that's a huge narcissist probably isn't awesome.</v>

1280
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.330
<v Speaker 3>that probably is an awesome mom line.</v>

1282
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.071
<v Speaker 3>Not the best.</v>

1283
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:01.841
<v Speaker 3>You remember mommy dearest?</v>

1284

<v Speaker 8>I want to see a little bit more of this supernatural.</v>

1452
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.960
<v Speaker 8>There's one I'm looking for a little less incest.</v>

1453
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.630
<v Speaker 8>One more where we disagree.</v>

1454
00:38:14.631 --> 00:38:15.950
<v Speaker 8>I want more incest.</v>

1455
00:38:15.951 --> 00:38:16.784
<v Speaker 8>Also,</v>

1456
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.780
<v Speaker 8>it's like the wild brother and sister fucking being surprised</v>

1457
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:23.523
<v Speaker 8>the way</v>

1458
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.900
<v Speaker 8>probably is how they used to do it</v>

1459
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.600
<v Speaker 8>gets even crazier.</v>

1460
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.460
<v Speaker 8>I don't even want to know.</v>

1461
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.140
<v Speaker 8>And that's actually reality by the way.</v>

1462
00:38:33.141 --> 00:38:34.070
<v Speaker 8>That's what people were doing.</v>

1463
00:38:34.071 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 8>They were fucking their sisters until like a week ago.</v>

1464
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.290
<v Speaker 6>I was in Birmingham.</v>

1465
00:38:37.291 --> 00:38:38.670
<v Speaker 6>That shit is still going on.</v>

1466
00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:39.720
<v Speaker 6>I saw some eyes,</v>

1467
00:38:39.721 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 6>place to God knows where</v>

1468
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.380
<v Speaker 8>people are fucking whatever they can,</v>

1469
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:43.951
<v Speaker 8>you know.</v>

1470
00:38:43.951 --> 00:38:45.930
<v Speaker 8>And if you can fuck your sister and no one's gonna know,</v>

1471
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.823
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

1472
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.880
<v Speaker 8>save gas,</v>

1473
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:48.810
<v Speaker 8>fuck your sister.</v>

1474
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.250
<v Speaker 8>Where's that bumper sticker?</v>

1475
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:52.740
<v Speaker 8>Let's make a deal.</v>

1476
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.150
<v Speaker 8>You want from Dick?</v>

1477
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.370
<v Speaker 8>I want to pussy.</v>

1478
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.273
<v Speaker 8>I got a dick.</v>

1479
00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.791
<v Speaker 6>God Damn.</v>

1480
00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 6>Why are we got to outsource?</v>

1481
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.770
<v Speaker 6>I really wonder how many relationships are are like boy,</v>

1482
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.351
<v Speaker 6>like brothers,</v>

1483
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 6>sister relationships.</v>

1484
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 6>I bet it's a lot</v>

1485
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:06.560
<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>

1486
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.710
<v Speaker 6>Like if you take in the whole United States,</v>

1487
00:39:08.711 --> 00:39:10.340
<v Speaker 6>I bet there are a lot of brothers.</v>

1488
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.140
<v Speaker 8>The ultimate form of keeping it local,</v>

1489
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.981
<v Speaker 8>keep it real,</v>

1490
00:39:13.981 --> 00:39:15.930
<v Speaker 8>keep it local by local.</v>

1491
00:39:15.931 --> 00:39:17.700
<v Speaker 8>Made local products.</v>

1492
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:18.511
<v Speaker 8>They're really,</v>

1493
00:39:18.511 --> 00:39:18.811
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

1494
00:39:18.811 --> 00:39:19.631
<v Speaker 8>it's a sick feeling,</v>

1495
00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:19.830
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1496
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.910
<v Speaker 8>Incest is a sick feeling.</v>

1497
00:39:20.911 --> 00:39:22.170
<v Speaker 8>Like the idea that people would do that.</v>

1498
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.310
<v Speaker 8>Maybe that's why the idea of nationalism is such a bizarre fucking feeling.</v>

1499
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:29.993
<v Speaker 8>Nationalism.</v>

1500
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.990
<v Speaker 8>Someone really being into being from one country.</v>

1501
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:35.820
<v Speaker 8>Keep it local.</v>

1502
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.150
<v Speaker 8>American rod here.</v>

1503
00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.290
<v Speaker 8>I'll play it a little more.</v>

1504
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.000
<v Speaker 8>Cause there's a Toby Keith song there's made in America and it's all about he</v>

1505
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.940
<v Speaker 8>pay a little more,</v>

1506
00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:46.350
<v Speaker 8>but it's made in America.</v>

1507
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.810
<v Speaker 8>Relax Toby.</v>

1508
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.970
<v Speaker 8>I would like it if it was amazing there.</v>

1509
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:57.210
<v Speaker 8>Oh there's another guy who is Keith urban on the country.</v>

1510
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.120
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't mind if things are made in other countries if I thought that people</v>

1511
00:40:00.121 --> 00:40:00.954
<v Speaker 8>were getting paid.</v>

1512
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.420
<v Speaker 8>The only thing about America is like if you buy a corvette,</v>

1513
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.950
<v Speaker 8>you know that someone's got a pension.</v>

1514
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:05.660
<v Speaker 8>You know that.</v>

1515
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 8>You know that the people that are making her in the auto union,</v>

1516
00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1517
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.500
<v Speaker 8>you really do know how much they get paid.</v>

1518
00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:13.220
<v Speaker 8>You can find out and you buy Nike's.</v>

1519
00:40:13.221 --> 00:40:13.410
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1520
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.280
<v Speaker 8>it's like some child,</v>

1521
00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:15.120
<v Speaker 8>they bound their hands,</v>

1522
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.811
<v Speaker 8>their fingers,</v>

1523
00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:16.644
<v Speaker 8>so they wouldn't grow.</v>

1524
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Speaker 8>If you buy like Foxconn products,</v>

1525
00:40:19.261 --> 00:40:21.720
<v Speaker 8>if you buy I iPhones are a lot of other cell phones.</v>

1526
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.380
<v Speaker 8>You know there,</v>

1527
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.800
<v Speaker 8>there's a huge debate right now they're trying to figure out how,</v>

1528
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:30.120
<v Speaker 8>how to straighten this out in the eyes of the people because they've in a ton of</v>

1529
00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:31.290
<v Speaker 8>suicides and you know,</v>

1530
00:40:31.291 --> 00:40:33.110
<v Speaker 8>their thoughts are on,</v>

1531
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.511
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1532
00:40:33.511 --> 00:40:34.740
<v Speaker 8>they've got a lot of suicides,</v>

1533
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.020
<v Speaker 8>so much so that install suicide nets,</v>

1534
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:41.700
<v Speaker 8>what staff suicide nets at the Fox on building and people would try to talk you</v>

1535
00:40:41.701 --> 00:40:42.534
<v Speaker 8>through this.</v>

1536
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.723
<v Speaker 8>So hilarious.</v>

1537
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.400
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

1538
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.970
<v Speaker 8>well statistically that's actually less than the number of suicides in the</v>

1539
00:40:47.971 --> 00:40:49.770
<v Speaker 8>population in that area.</v>

1540
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:50.341
<v Speaker 8>And you're like,</v>

1541
00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:51.150
<v Speaker 8>first of all,</v>

1542
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.510
<v Speaker 8>that's,</v>

1543
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 8>that's,</v>

1544
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:56.850
<v Speaker 8>that's a ridiculous thing because what you're saying is that the whole time</v>

1545
00:40:56.851 --> 00:40:59.550
<v Speaker 8>they're alive when they would commit suicide.</v>

1546
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.390
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

1547
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.790
<v Speaker 8>How many people kill themselves at work,</v>

1548
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.601
<v Speaker 8>at work,</v>

1549
00:41:03.601 --> 00:41:06.290
<v Speaker 8>at work in the place that they hate the most?</v>

1550
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:06.690
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1551
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.610
<v Speaker 8>That's your,</v>

1552
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.430
<v Speaker 8>you're talking about a completely different experience talking about people that</v>

1553
00:41:11.431 --> 00:41:16.170
<v Speaker 8>are living on campus and our proxy throwing themselves off the fucking roof and</v>

1554
00:41:16.171 --> 00:41:19.730
<v Speaker 8>smashing their brains onto the concrete and the pain.</v>

1555
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.100
<v Speaker 8>We don't,</v>

1556
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.100
<v Speaker 8>we can't find the combat is statistically less than would be had they been</v>

1557
00:41:25.561 --> 00:41:26.460
<v Speaker 8>slaves.</v>

1558
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:27.721
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1559
00:41:27.721 --> 00:41:28.050
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

1560
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:28.770
<v Speaker 8>it's weird.</v>

1561
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.450
<v Speaker 8>But that's the only way you're going to get a cell phone.</v>

1562
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.190
<v Speaker 8>They don't know if there's no other way.</v>

1563
00:41:32.191 --> 00:41:33.024
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1564
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 8>they've tried to figure</v>

1565
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.821
<v Speaker 2>out how to,</v>

1566
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 2>make them in other countries.</v>

1568
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And I know they started making iPhones in Brazil.</v>

1569
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 2>They make some stuff in Korea,</v>

1570
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 2>South Korea where they,</v>

1571
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:41.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1572
00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

1573
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.850
<v Speaker 2>they don't have anything remotely like a,</v>

1574
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 2>what they got going on in China.</v>

1575
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 8>Would you ever hire Foxcom for like a small job,</v>

1576
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.660
<v Speaker 8>like stuffing envelopes or something like that?</v>

1577
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:54.020
<v Speaker 8>Because lately I was wondering really how cheap it would be if I just had them</v>

1578
00:41:54.021 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 8>do like small things.</v>

1579
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:55.900
<v Speaker 8>I A lot,</v>

1580
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of that started factories in China.</v>

1581
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1582
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.530
<v Speaker 2>and they started factories in China.</v>

1583
00:42:01.531 --> 00:42:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I know a dude who makes pool cue cases out there and he lives in China.</v>

1584
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1585
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1586
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you decided,</v>

1587
00:42:08.161 --> 00:42:09.600
<v Speaker 2>but he's an American guy and they,</v>

1588
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:09.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1589
00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:10.320
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

1590
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.300
<v Speaker 2>their manufacturing is like good out there and get good skilled craftsmen and</v>

1591
00:42:15.301 --> 00:42:15.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1592
00:42:15.601 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a way cheaper for them and they,</v>

1593
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.900
<v Speaker 2>they can make a ton of profit,</v>

1594
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:19.591
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1595
00:42:19.591 --> 00:42:22.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of them get over there and they actually like it too,</v>

1596
00:42:22.021 --> 00:42:22.854
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1597
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.331
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1598
00:42:24.331 --> 00:42:25.080
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

1599
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1600
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.273
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

1601
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:27.991
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1602
00:42:27.991 --> 00:42:28.830
<v Speaker 8>we like living in China.</v>

1603
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.120
<v Speaker 8>I think a lot of white guys do.</v>

1604
00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.910
<v Speaker 8>If I've talked to a bunch of white</v>

1605
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.190
<v Speaker 2>guys that have been to China and they say that Chinese girls like,</v>

1606
00:42:35.191 --> 00:42:35.551
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1607
00:42:35.551 --> 00:42:36.211
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>

1608
00:42:36.211 --> 00:42:36.841
<v Speaker 2>Look at this white guy.</v>

1609
00:42:36.841 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I like him.</v>

1610
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.930
<v Speaker 5>I think it makes sense.</v>

1611
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 5>I think like all dudes are going to wind up with Asian chicks.</v>

1612
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1613
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 5>Like how many dudes have you lost the Asian chicks?</v>

1615
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.953
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1616
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 5>well I haven't lost anybody but no,</v>

1617
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.620
<v Speaker 5>no one,</v>

1618
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:51.771
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1619
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 5>But one guy that I dated for like years is engaged to,</v>

1620
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 5>well she's,</v>

1621
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:56.121
<v Speaker 5>she's Indian,</v>

1622
00:42:56.121 --> 00:42:56.890
<v Speaker 5>but that's Asia.</v>

1623
00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1624
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.100
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1625
00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:58.911
<v Speaker 5>it makes sense.</v>

1626
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:03.620
<v Speaker 5>Like there was like a whole wave of like black chicks being like white women are</v>

1627
00:43:03.621 --> 00:43:03.951
<v Speaker 5>taking,</v>

1628
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 5>are men and they like have asses or something.</v>

1629
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1630
00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.170
<v Speaker 5>but now it's like,</v>

1631
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we're a real threat,</v>

1632
00:43:10.491 --> 00:43:12.060
<v Speaker 5>I think is Asian chick is where,</v>

1633
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 8>but he's going to wind down,</v>

1634
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.150
<v Speaker 8>it's like going back to an iPhone three do an iPhone five</v>

1635
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:15.711
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1636
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:15.971
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1637
00:43:15.971 --> 00:43:16.581
<v Speaker 5>I have nothing.</v>

1638
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I can't compete with an Asian chick.</v>

1639
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.820
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing grosser than that white woman,</v>

1640
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.500
<v Speaker 2>white women are taken are men</v>

1641
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.463
<v Speaker 8>attitude.</v>

1642
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.900
<v Speaker 8>You can't like who the fuck you like in the black eyes are supposed to like you</v>

1643
00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.790
<v Speaker 8>supposed to like you more.</v>

1644
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:36.270
<v Speaker 8>That attitude is the very reason why white girls are preferred by those black</v>

1645
00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:43.201
<v Speaker 8>guys because white girls aren't going to be as crazy angry and you know,</v>

1646
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 8>why does mother fucking time to go out with my time</v>

1647
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:46.920
<v Speaker 5>flag being mad like,</v>

1648
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.690
<v Speaker 5>oh if the card pulled up more,</v>

1649
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.780
<v Speaker 5>I could've parked like somebody else would have still gotten that space.</v>

1650
00:43:51.781 --> 00:43:53.240
<v Speaker 5>Like that black guy does not want you</v>

1651
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.330
<v Speaker 8>regardless of what race is happening opened that racism is in the in comparison</v>

1652
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:00.470
<v Speaker 8>to the other way around.</v>

1653
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.130
<v Speaker 8>Don't they know we've done that with so much.</v>

1654
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 8>If it was the other way around and people,</v>

1655
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1656
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.000
<v Speaker 8>if it was a bunch of,</v>

1657
00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:06.630
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1658
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.900
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1659
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 8>white girls that were complaining that some girls getting fucked by a black guy,</v>

1660
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:11.800
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

1661
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1662
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.130
<v Speaker 8>that would be,</v>

1663
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.023
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1664
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.390
<v Speaker 8>there'll be a completely different things and that would be like KKK and this is</v>

1665
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:17.750
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

1666
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:18.440
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1667
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 8>hey Chris,</v>

1668
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:19.783
<v Speaker 8>it's interesting that it's,</v>

1669
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 8>you can say like,</v>

1670
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:22.580
<v Speaker 8>why are these white women got up?</v>

1671
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:23.414
<v Speaker 8>Fuck on man.</v>

1672
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.040
<v Speaker 8>You can say that you were a black charger.</v>

1673
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.160
<v Speaker 5>I do think with,</v>

1674
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.490
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1675
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:28.710
<v Speaker 5>I have no anger about the Asian chick thing,</v>

1676
00:44:28.711 --> 00:44:29.640
<v Speaker 5>but I do think,</v>

1677
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1678
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:30.461
<v Speaker 5>like I'm,</v>

1679
00:44:30.461 --> 00:44:31.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm half,</v>

1680
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:36.230
<v Speaker 5>but it makes sense like the guy's gravitating toward them because just the way</v>

1681
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:37.471
<v Speaker 5>it used to be,</v>

1682
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 5>like you used to be with a man because like,</v>

1683
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:42.340
<v Speaker 5>he made a living and you,</v>

1684
00:44:42.341 --> 00:44:44.070
<v Speaker 5>you kind of needed him and you looked at him like,</v>

1685
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:44.933
<v Speaker 5>I need you,</v>

1686
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:45.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1687
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 5>and easy lowered your voice.</v>

1688
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's how like women talk.</v>

1689
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 5>They're just like,</v>

1690
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.371
<v Speaker 5>I love you.</v>

1691
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:51.204
<v Speaker 5>Do you want dinner?</v>

1692
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.200
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1693
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:52.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1694
00:44:52.471 --> 00:44:52.921
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1695
00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:53.251
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1696
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:54.090
<v Speaker 5>what about me?</v>

1697
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1698
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.940
<v Speaker 5>but it checks,</v>

1699
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1700
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 5>like there's,</v>

1703
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 5>this isn't their first language.</v>

1704
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 5>And they come here and they kind of need you and they're like quiet and they</v>

1705
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:05.760
<v Speaker 5>like have smaller pussies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's really what fucks him up.</v>

1846
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 3>like a proper gentleman at the beginning.</v>

1847
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:35.224
<v Speaker 3>I don't do hug</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was adorable.</v>

1851
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 3>He was so terrified of her.</v>

1852
00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.920
<v Speaker 3>It was like he was in the room with a tiger that he wanted a pet,</v>

1853
00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 3>but he was too scared to</v>

1854
00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:48.580

<v Speaker 3>She's only 25</v>

1879
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.150
<v Speaker 3>that's not her either.</v>

1880
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.333
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1881
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.680
<v Speaker 3>a killer.</v>

1882
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.513
<v Speaker 3>Grow.</v>

1883
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Go down to that picture,</v>

1884
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:14.044
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1885
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to do a video?</v>

1886
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you've got to find the video highlight reel.</v>

1887
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I love her.</v>

1888
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:29.241
<v Speaker 3>What a nightmare.</v>

1889
00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:30.850
<v Speaker 3>A hot chick that could beat the fuck out of.</v>

1890
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.670
<v Speaker 3>When is she coming back on Joe?</v>

1891
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.960
<v Speaker 3>We'll work on something.</v>

1892
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 3>She just won the title.</v>

1893
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to do this stuff.</v>

1894
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:40.420
<v Speaker 9>We'll do this</v>

1895
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.383
<v Speaker 3>snap.</v>

1896
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:42.923
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch this.</v>

1897
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.310
<v Speaker 3>She brought,</v>

1898
00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 3>she's broken a couple of girls arms.</v>

1899
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to look at you Amy and started.</v>

1900
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:49.500
<v Speaker 3>We're lucky,</v>

1901
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1902
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.720
<v Speaker 3>It's why you are fries when a Shitty,</v>

1903
00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.183
<v Speaker 3>she's a beast.</v>

1904
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.150
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>

1905
00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.230
<v Speaker 3>I love her.</v>

1906
00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 2>She's a bad ass it fucking jail.</v>

1907
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.101
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1908
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Look at that and this is in the Song Song Austin,</v>

1909
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:07.881
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1910
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:08.031
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1911
00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 3>it's not you asshole.</v>

1912
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.110
<v Speaker 3>She actually filmed and edited this,</v>

1913
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 3>these arm bars.</v>

1914
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.970
<v Speaker 2>This is nasty shit.</v>

1915
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.260
<v Speaker 2>See in in judo they stand you up way quicker than they do in MMA or even in</v>

1916
00:51:19.261 --> 00:51:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu though they don't really stand you up usually Jujitsu,</v>

1917
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.210
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

1918
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:26.640
<v Speaker 2>in judo they have to go for their submissions really quickly because once they</v>

1919
00:51:26.641 --> 00:51:27.660
<v Speaker 2>get to the ground they got to get,</v>

1920
00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:31.410
<v Speaker 2>they've got to get a submission on before the referee gets to them and she</v>

1921
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:36.240
<v Speaker 2>developed the ability to snap armbars bars on people with lightening speed and I</v>

1922
00:51:36.241 --> 00:51:38.280
<v Speaker 2>don't think any of these girls are ready for that shit.</v>

1923
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:39.323
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

1924
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.860
<v Speaker 2>she's so good at it.</v>

1925
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else takes way more time to go for shit.</v>

1926
00:51:43.801 --> 00:51:48.420
<v Speaker 2>She's just got a few techniques like especially armbars just completely locked</v>

1927
00:51:48.421 --> 00:51:50.040
<v Speaker 2>down and when you roll with her,</v>

1928
00:51:50.041 --> 00:51:53.250
<v Speaker 2>it's almost just a matter of time before she gets one of those on you because</v>

1929
00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:57.720
<v Speaker 2>you're probably not used to anybody having the kind of submissions that she has</v>

1930
00:51:57.721 --> 00:51:58.500
<v Speaker 2>where they just,</v>

1931
00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.880
<v Speaker 2>she explodes on you.</v>

1932
00:51:59.881 --> 00:52:02.230
<v Speaker 2>She's strong as fuck and she's super tactical.</v>

1933
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.091
<v Speaker 2>Look at that arm bar you see,</v>

1934
00:52:03.091 --> 00:52:04.180
<v Speaker 2>how do you see how,</v>

1935
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:04.651
<v Speaker 2>watch that,</v>

1936
00:52:04.651 --> 00:52:05.970
<v Speaker 2>but just back that up a second.</v>

1937
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.100
<v Speaker 2>This is like no space in between her body and that girls face as she moves</v>

1938
00:52:11.101 --> 00:52:11.670
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1939
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:13.260
<v Speaker 2>When she locks this chick down,</v>

1940
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:15.270
<v Speaker 2>she starts beating on her and as soon as she has this song,</v>

1941
00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:15.601
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

1942
00:52:15.601 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 2>See how fast that goes.</v>

1943
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1944
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:18.800
<v Speaker 3>She swung that leg over fish.</v>

1945
00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:20.880
<v Speaker 3>She knew exactly where her face was,</v>

1946
00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.230
<v Speaker 3>clamped that shit down.</v>

1947
00:52:22.231 --> 00:52:23.580
<v Speaker 3>There was no air in there.</v>

1948
00:52:23.581 --> 00:52:24.570
<v Speaker 3>That was death.</v>

1949
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.740
<v Speaker 3>There was no getting out.</v>

1950
00:52:25.741 --> 00:52:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I just think she's really pouty lips.</v>

1951
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1952
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:29.310
<v Speaker 3>She wanted to make out with you,</v>

1953
00:52:29.311 --> 00:52:30.690
<v Speaker 3>which you go last boat for a little bit.</v>

1954
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1955
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.340
<v Speaker 3>You would?</v>

1957
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1958
00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.773
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1959
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.243
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have to.</v>

1960
00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:35.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1961
00:52:35.851 --> 00:52:35.941
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1962
00:52:35.941 --> 00:52:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I've never worked with a girl,</v>

1963
00:52:37.111 --> 00:52:38.640
<v Speaker 3>but I get like major girl crushes.</v>

1964
00:52:38.641 --> 00:52:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1965
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.320
<v Speaker 3>I've never hooked up with a girl.</v>

1966
00:52:40.321 --> 00:52:41.430
<v Speaker 3>But you're opening up your idea.</v>

1967
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to,</v>

1968
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm like at least hook up with a girl,</v>

1969
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.320
<v Speaker 3>but at least once I can arrange that.</v>

1970
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Like the hottest girl ever.</v>

1971
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I can let you choose from a book.</v>

1972
00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:49.981
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1973
00:52:49.981 --> 00:52:50.814
<v Speaker 3>I like girls.</v>

1974
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get crabs.</v>

1975
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.673
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1976
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Whatever he's going,</v>

1977
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Mr Lobster.</v>

1978
00:52:56.401 --> 00:52:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

1979
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:58.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to use that money.</v>

1980
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 3>All you can eat me.</v>

1981
00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:02.880
<v Speaker 3>You're not setting me up with anybody.</v>

1982
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:03.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1983
00:53:03.451 --> 00:53:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I would say no.</v>

1984
00:53:04.291 --> 00:53:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to do that.</v>

1985
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:05.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1986
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.390
<v Speaker 3>that's not happening to me.</v>

1987
00:53:06.391 --> 00:53:07.224
<v Speaker 3>I'm your filter.</v>

1988
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just be real with you.</v>

1989
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:09.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be real with you.</v>

1990
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Either of you at all.</v>

1991
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to go camping this weekend?</v>

1992
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.430
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

1993
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:15.001
<v Speaker 3>The ones who got you?</v>

1994
00:53:15.001 --> 00:53:15.211
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

1995
00:53:15.211 --> 00:53:16.170
<v Speaker 3>How can I remember?</v>

1996
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.070
<v Speaker 3>I remember being like,</v>

1997
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I just had it.</v>

1998
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I saw the bruise from the IB in my arm and you guys were like,</v>

1999
00:53:20.371 --> 00:53:21.540
<v Speaker 3>you need this?</v>

2000
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.291
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2001
00:53:22.291 --> 00:53:22.561
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2002
00:53:22.561 --> 00:53:22.861
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2003
00:53:22.861 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 3>and then I said yes right before you blew all the in my face.</v>

2004
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.810
<v Speaker 6>I could tell you were getting into that.</v>

2005
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:28.501
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2006
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:31.070
<v Speaker 6>just give it to me and don't blow this smiley face.</v>

2007
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:33.180
<v Speaker 6>You guys are the worst,</v>

2008
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2009
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.321
<v Speaker 6>Aren't you glad you did?</v>

2010
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:34.771
<v Speaker 6>It felt good,</v>

2011
00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2012
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 6>You don't feel sick or anything?</v>

2013
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:36.631
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2014
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:37.190
<v Speaker 6>I feel fine.</v>

2015
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:40.470

2016
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.870
<v Speaker 8>high and he couldn't remember his act.</v>

00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:44.520
<v Speaker 8>Huh?</v>

2023
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:44.781
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2024
00:53:44.781 --> 00:53:46.110
<v Speaker 8>I've been how it Greg before?</v>

2025
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 8>Let me see.</v>

2026
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.180
<v Speaker 8>He's essentially,</v>

2027
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if he talks about,</v>

2028
00:53:49.321 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 8>I know he was smoking pot for a little while,</v>

2029
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 8>but then he stopped doing that too.</v>

2030
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.270
<v Speaker 8>But he,</v>

2031
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.881
<v Speaker 8>he went for,</v>

2032
00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:54.571
<v Speaker 8>when I met him,</v>

2033
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:58.560
<v Speaker 8>he was an alcoholic when we were like 21 together and then he,</v>

2034
00:53:58.561 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2035
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 8>he quit it like instantly just cold Turkey.</v>

2036
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:02.370
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

2037
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2038
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.840
<v Speaker 8>No Aa.</v>

2039
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 8>Did he have something happen?</v>

2040
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.180
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2041
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 8>I just decided to,</v>

2042
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.340
<v Speaker 8>this is fucking up his life.</v>

2043
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:08.950
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2044
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 8>It was pretty smart about it.</v>

2045
00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 8>But then later he realized that he could smoke pot wherein,</v>

2046
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:12.841
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2047
00:54:12.841 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 8>because if you talk to like a doctor drew type character,</v>

2048
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:15.421
<v Speaker 8>they'll tell you,</v>

2049
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.254
<v Speaker 8>you can't do that.</v>

2050
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:17.720
<v Speaker 8>They'll tell you that you can't.</v>

2051
00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.280
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>

2052
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.113
<v Speaker 8>Dalton.</v>

2053
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:19.621
<v Speaker 8>Dalton,</v>

2054
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 8>any substances.</v>

2055
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.653
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2056
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 8>But some people even have,</v>

2057
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2058
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.560
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2059
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>

2060
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.060
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to ever encourage anybody to even try this,</v>

2061
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 8>but I know that some people used to be alcoholics,</v>

2062
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.370
<v Speaker 8>took a long time off drinking and then began drinking casually.</v>

2063
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:34.870
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

2064
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:35.703
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

2065
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 8>Nobody have done it well,</v>

2066
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.410
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

2067
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:38.190
<v Speaker 8>Well I think so.</v>

2068
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 8>I think there's different levels of alcoholism.</v>

2069
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 8>That's what we have to realize.</v>

2070
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:45.480
<v Speaker 8>There's some physiological connections.</v>

2071
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 8>Like there's some people,</v>

2072
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:48.330
<v Speaker 8>they just have that gene,</v>

2073
00:54:48.331 --> 00:54:51.120
<v Speaker 8>whatever that wacky gene is and they can't drink at all.</v>

2074
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 8>Or they will go off,</v>

2075
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.520
<v Speaker 8>they'll go off the rails.</v>

2076
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 8>And then there's other folks that,</v>

2077
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.170
<v Speaker 8>it was a compulsion and it could have been beating off,</v>

2078
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 8>it could have been gambling,</v>

2079
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 8>it could have been a million different things,</v>

2080
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 8>but it happened to be drinking.</v>

2081
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.770
<v Speaker 8>And then they realize that this is a,</v>

2082
00:55:05.771 --> 00:55:08.490
<v Speaker 8>an issue that they have with their own psychology.</v>

2083
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 8>And then slowly over time they evolve it.</v>

2084
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:14.100
<v Speaker 8>And then one day they were at a party and have a glass of wine and they're fine</v>

2085
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 8>and they don't want to go out and get cocaine and beat people up.</v>

2086
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:17.574
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>

2087
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.090
<v Speaker 8>why not?</v>

2088
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.980
<v Speaker 8>The Germans don't drink.</v>

2089
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 8>So like because they are,</v>

2090
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2091
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 8>because they were too hard.</v>

2092
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.521
<v Speaker 8>And alcoholics.</v>

2093
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:23.860
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2094
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.270
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2095
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.481
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

2096
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:27.630
<v Speaker 8>I feel like most of the time I'm like the only comic drinking.</v>

2097
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.111
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2098
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 8>I'm happy when I see a guy like that's how,</v>

2099
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 8>that's how it seems like it's so focused now.</v>

2100
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:34.943
<v Speaker 8>Clean is,</v>

2101
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 8>Norton has been cleaned though since he was right.</v>

2102
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.433
<v Speaker 8>But I,</v>

2103
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 8>I like very much likes with sermons.</v>

2104
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:41.100
<v Speaker 8>Really.</v>

2105
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:41.900
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2106
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.030
<v Speaker 8>I worked with him a bunch of shit.</v>

2107
00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.271
<v Speaker 8>I had never knew.</v>

2108
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:47.790
<v Speaker 8>I never knew any of those guys when they hurt were boozing.</v>

2109
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.571
<v Speaker 8>I wonder what,</v>

2110
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:49.980
<v Speaker 8>even if I knew a tell a little bit,</v>

2111
00:55:49.981 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 8>but I never like saw him like wasted or anything like that.</v>

2112
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:53.551
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2113
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:54.384
<v Speaker 8>I've seen him wasted.</v>

2114
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.620
<v Speaker 8>I've seen him wasted at the Improv.</v>

2115
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:55.831
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2116
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:56.011
<v Speaker 8>it was,</v>

2117
00:55:56.011 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 8>it's nice to see a guy figure out,</v>

2118
00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.730
<v Speaker 8>well this is not good for me.</v>

2119
00:55:59.731 --> 00:55:59.980
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2120
00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 8>That's probably better to not take this back on that up in an alley.</v>

2121
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:04.081
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2122
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:04.920
<v Speaker 8>I've always been,</v>

2123
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.310
<v Speaker 8>even when I was a drinker,</v>

2124
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:08.641
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2125
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 8>like when I,</v>

2126
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.870
<v Speaker 8>when I didn't smoke pot and I only would,</v>

2127
00:56:10.871 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2128
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 8>drink on weekends or whatever I would do,</v>

2129
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.540
<v Speaker 8>it was never something that I had to do and just,</v>

2130
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

2131
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 8>Could do it or not do it.</v>

2132
00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.300
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2133
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 8>But we all know somebody that's not like that.</v>

2134
00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:22.600
<v Speaker 8>We all know that one dude that's just itching for that drink all,</v>

2135
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 8>it's fun to be around them.</v>

2136
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Worse when they get off and then they,</v>

2137
00:56:26.121 --> 00:56:26.560
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2138
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.180
<v Speaker 2>they start drinking like right away</v>

2139
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.660
<v Speaker 5>and they don't realize that it's not like that for you.</v>

2140
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:31.020
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2141

<v Speaker 2>one of the oldest in Hollywood and with great history of like so many comedians,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so many of comedians started out there.</v>

2230
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.600
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2231
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I started out there really,</v>

2232
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2233
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't start out there,</v>

2234
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:46.900
<v Speaker 2>but I got good there.</v>

2235
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.490

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2240
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it was my time at the comedy store when I was just on TV when I,</v>

2241
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>when I really started dedicated myself to stand up,</v>

2242
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:03.370

<v Speaker 2>that's the place that helped me develop cause it's so fucked up there.</v>

01:06:40.711 --> 01:06:41.544
<v Speaker 6>Like you</v>

2559
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 6>safe.</v>

2560
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:46.470
<v Speaker 6>I did not shave my body,</v>

2561
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.511
<v Speaker 8>my balls,</v>

2562
01:06:47.511 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 8>and then put aftershave on my balls just to see what it would feel like.</v>

2563
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:50.480
<v Speaker 8>Kind of go,</v>

2564
01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 8>whoa.</v>

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:52.483
<v Speaker 8>it was not,</v>

2567
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.290
<v Speaker 8>I'll tell you it didn't really,</v>

2568
01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.273
<v Speaker 8>it hurt,</v>

2569
01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:56.690
<v Speaker 8>but it was more like,</v>

2570
01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.440
<v Speaker 8>I would say more like a really alert sensation that a pain reminded you.</v>

2571
01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.050
<v Speaker 8>Follicle.</v>

2572
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.460
<v Speaker 8>It was like there was no cuts.</v>

2573
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:05.750
<v Speaker 8>Luckily I didn't,</v>

2574
01:07:05.751 --> 01:07:05.930
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2575
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.120
<v Speaker 8>I didn't injure my balls during the shaving.</v>

2576
01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:08.331
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2577
01:07:08.331 --> 01:07:09.081
<v Speaker 8>there was no nicking.</v>

2578
01:07:09.081 --> 01:07:11.170
<v Speaker 8>I fortunately had a really good razor.</v>

2579
01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:11.991
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2580
01:07:11.991 --> 01:07:12.651
<v Speaker 8>The event is,</v>

2581
01:07:12.651 --> 01:07:14.000
<v Speaker 8>I like to see my balls</v>

2582
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.180
<v Speaker 8>to be covered and now my,</v>

2583
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:20.060
<v Speaker 8>my balls are so salt and pepper.</v>

2584
01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 8>It's so sad.</v>

2585
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.860
<v Speaker 8>It's literally maybe 20%.</v>

2586
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.610
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2587
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:26.420
<v Speaker 8>not 20,</v>

2588
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:26.991
<v Speaker 8>but 10.</v>

2589
01:07:26.991 --> 01:07:29.700
<v Speaker 8>I'd say $110 chocolate munchkins.</v>

2590
01:07:29.701 --> 01:07:31.080
<v Speaker 8>So one and a 10 is gray.</v>

2591
01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:32.510
<v Speaker 8>Mike.</v>

2592
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:33.200
<v Speaker 8>They're going,</v>

2593
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:33.780
<v Speaker 8>oh no.</v>

2594
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.360
<v Speaker 8>And so I don't like looking at him.</v>

2595
01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:36.390
<v Speaker 8>So I shaved the board.</v>

2598
01:07:39.111 --> 01:07:40.960

2599
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:42.260
<v Speaker 5>English.</v>

<v Speaker 7>podcasts the other day about these giant packs of wolves and the Soviet Union.</v>

2640
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 7>Somebody sent me a tweet right afterwards about a story where these 400 wolves</v>

2641
01:08:57.601 --> 01:08:59.400
<v Speaker 7>had killed 30 horses.</v>

<v Speaker 7>They're a pack of 400 wolves apparently is like from over a year ago,</v>

2643
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.510
<v Speaker 7>but he just tweeted me to show me how bad it actually got.</v>

2644
01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.440

2645
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.070

01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:10.301
<v Speaker 7>They didn't have pictures.</v>

2648
01:09:10.301 --> 01:09:13.660
<v Speaker 7>They had just had the article about how they're hiring teams of hunters to go</v>

2649
01:09:13.661 --> 01:09:14.494
<v Speaker 7>after these walls.</v>

2650
01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:16.930
<v Speaker 7>This is an unprecedented size pack.</v>

2651
01:09:16.931 --> 01:09:17.764
<v Speaker 7>They usually,</v>

2652
01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:20.320
<v Speaker 7>they go and pack of packs of like less than a dozen,</v>

2653
01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.880
<v Speaker 7>much smaller packs.</v>

2654
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.800
<v Speaker 7>Really taking over taking the Thrones in the Soviet Union.</v>

2655
01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.450
<v Speaker 7>There's some spots were former Soviet Union,</v>

2656
01:09:28.451 --> 01:09:29.051
<v Speaker 7>what do you call it now?</v>

2657
01:09:29.051 --> 01:09:29.470
<v Speaker 7>Russia.</v>

2658
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:30.101
<v Speaker 7>What do you call that?</v>

2659
01:09:30.101 --> 01:09:30.910
<v Speaker 7>Big,</v>

2660
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:31.391
<v Speaker 7>what do you call it?</v>

2661
01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:33.310
<v Speaker 7>That because Russia is only part of it,</v>

2662
01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:34.144
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2663
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:35.561
<v Speaker 7>Whatever it is.</v>

2664
01:09:35.561 --> 01:09:36.190
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2665
01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:39.250
<v Speaker 7>I think this is happening like up north and it's,</v>

2666
01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:39.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2667
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.930
<v Speaker 7>these poor people live in this</v>

2668
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:43.743
<v Speaker 7>fucking sucks.</v>

2669
01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.230
<v Speaker 7>It sucks to live up there and apparently the wolves are starving so they just,</v>

2670
01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.790
<v Speaker 7>they just got together and I said,</v>

2671
01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:49.390
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>

2672
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:51.000
<v Speaker 7>the all of us together there,</v>

2673
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:52.120
<v Speaker 7>I guess they figured it out.</v>

2674
01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:52.954
<v Speaker 7>It's overpopulated.</v>

2675
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.980
<v Speaker 7>Six people,</v>

2676
01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:55.960
<v Speaker 7>six walls can't really go in and kill horses.</v>

2677
01:09:55.961 --> 01:09:56.794
<v Speaker 7>They'll shoot Ya.</v>

2678
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:58.450
<v Speaker 7>But if there's 400 of us,</v>

2679
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.330
<v Speaker 7>we're going to get some horses and they're not even going to shoot at you</v>

2680
01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.380
<v Speaker 7>because you're going to be terrified.</v>

2681
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.340
<v Speaker 7>She imagined I just rush in and in,</v>

2682
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:07.720
<v Speaker 7>in the Russian Tundra,</v>

2683
01:10:07.721 --> 01:10:12.130
<v Speaker 7>wherever the fuck it would be like frozen outside and you look out and see 400</v>

2684
01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:12.983
<v Speaker 7>wolves</v>

2685
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.893
<v Speaker 8>horses.</v>

2686
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:15.440
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

2687
01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 8>Well that was the thing about that game of Thrones movies.</v>

2688
01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:22.580
<v Speaker 8>Like it really connected you with how these people had to live back then.</v>

2689
01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.570
<v Speaker 8>It was a real like chicken,</v>

2690
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.820
<v Speaker 8>it's my white walkers.</v>

2691
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.103
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

2692
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.060
<v Speaker 8>I was watching it with Mrs Rogan and I was like,</v>

2693
01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:37.600
<v Speaker 8>what happens if one of those stupid wooden wheels brakes,</v>

2694
01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:38.950
<v Speaker 8>they have an extra wouldn't wheel.</v>

2695
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.710
<v Speaker 8>We're going to camp here.</v>

2696
01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:46.953
<v Speaker 8>I was</v>

2697
01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:52.040
<v Speaker 8>looking at how slow it was moving to and then like that's real shit.</v>

2698
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 8>It moves like the way you jog.</v>

2699
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:55.850
<v Speaker 8>That's how people got across the country.</v>

2700
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.431
<v Speaker 8>We're talking about,</v>

2701
01:10:58.431 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 8>we've been traveling for over a month.</v>

2702
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:04.940
<v Speaker 8>Look what you have to bring enough food and water for a month and this stupid</v>

2703
01:11:04.941 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 8>big box that they're pulling on dumb wooden wheels and they're just hoping</v>

2704
01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 8>there's going to be a road there when they get there.</v>

2705
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 8>I was mad that the valet valet like wasn't ready with my car.</v>

2707
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.371
<v Speaker 8>Back then.</v>

2708
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:18.001
<v Speaker 8>What did you have?</v>

2709
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 8>You had like a kingdom and then you had some roads that would go off until like</v>

2710
01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 8>villages and shit and everything would just be the same ground that was stepped</v>

2711
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.980
<v Speaker 8>on over and over again until it flattened out.</v>

2712
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:29.311
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

2713
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:30.900

2714
01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:32.070
<v Speaker 8>That's how roads are creating,</v>

2715
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2741
01:12:15.151 --> 01:12:15.690
<v Speaker 8>When people,</v>

2742
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 8>the king would get there and they'd all get off their horses.</v>

2743
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:18.601
<v Speaker 8>You just said,</v>

2744
01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:22.020
<v Speaker 8>I had to hope that the king wasn't a fucking total psychopath.</v>

2745
01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:22.260

<v Speaker 8>James can do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

2757
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:38.800
<v Speaker 5>and like groups of people are supposed to die out like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2776
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:13.490

2786
01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:30.320
<v Speaker 8>that part of my brain.</v>

2787
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:32.030
<v Speaker 8>I like to keep that part of my brain under route.</v>

2788
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:32.440
<v Speaker 6>Just no,</v>

2789
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.300
<v Speaker 6>just to experience different flavors.</v>

2790
01:13:34.301 --> 01:13:37.550
<v Speaker 6>Like a total neanderthal lurking that I got a wild,</v>

<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2792
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:39.530
<v Speaker 8>Pansy deep in the back of my brain.</v>

2793
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:41.780
<v Speaker 8>And if I'm in a hotel and it's on fire,</v>

2794
01:13:41.781 --> 01:13:42.650
<v Speaker 8>that's when it comes out.</v>

2795
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.520
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2796
01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.230
<v Speaker 8>Oh Shit.</v>

2797
01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:44.450
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2798
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:47.840
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying if there's a bunch of people in front of a door,</v>

2799
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.770
<v Speaker 8>we were at,</v>

2800
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:50.450
<v Speaker 8>we were at a hotel fire in San Francisco.</v>

2801
01:13:50.451 --> 01:13:53.540
<v Speaker 8>It's four 30 in the morning and all these people were moving slow down this</v>

2802
01:13:53.541 --> 01:13:54.374
<v Speaker 8>flight of stairs.</v>

2803
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:55.570
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

2804
01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:59.200
<v Speaker 8>I was seriously contemplating running over some fucking pages,</v>

2805
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 8>started stabbings.</v>

2806
01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:00.651
<v Speaker 8>Cause I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>you guys are not the first of a lot of people were on Ambien.</v>

2809
01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.440
<v Speaker 8>Cause it's true where people want people,</v>

2810
01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:09.890
<v Speaker 8>a woman was having to explain to her husband as he was walking down the stairs.</v>

2811
01:14:09.891 --> 01:14:10.280
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2816
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:12.941
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>

2817
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:13.570

<v Speaker 3>I was woken up.</v>

2823
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 3>I got woken up fire in the middle of the night at the hotel.</v>

2824

<v Speaker 3>I was on Ambien.</v>

2825
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2960
01:17:05.281 --> 01:17:05.580
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>

2961

<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter.</v>

2962
01:17:06.031 --> 01:17:06.870
<v Speaker 7>It's not yours anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And I don't have a car.</v>

2966
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't want the economy.</v>

2970
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 5>So it's never,</v>

2971
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.730
<v Speaker 5>never really.</v>

2972
01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:22.563
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2973
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like really shitty.</v>

2974
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have a family and you're just like,</v>

2975
01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:28.483
<v Speaker 5>what do you do?</v>

2976
01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 5>They said 40% of young adults between 18 and 34 living home,</v>

2977
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

2978
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.310
<v Speaker 8>I would almost want to go back.</v>

2979
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 8>Is that right?</v>

2980
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:39.950
<v Speaker 8>Or are they really need is like nothing.</v>

2981
01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 8>Like if my mom lived here,</v>

2982
01:17:41.331 --> 01:17:44.490
<v Speaker 8>I could almost live with my mom because I'm never really home serious.</v>

2983
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:44.661
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2984
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:44.781
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2985
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:45.051
<v Speaker 8>I'm not.</v>

2986
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:46.130
<v Speaker 8>I'm never home.</v>

2987
01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

2988
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.851
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2989
01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:48.170
<v Speaker 8>if she like,</v>

2990
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 8>cause I use it just for sleeping and then I'll tell you what,</v>

2991
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 8>there's nothing wrong with living with your mom.</v>

2992
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 8>If your mom respects you as an adult and you love her and she's not a needy</v>

2993
01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.380
<v Speaker 8>person and you can be around her and you know,</v>

2994
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.780
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to babysit or anyway like that.</v>

2995
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.571
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2996
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 8>My mom was a very easy going person.</v>

2997
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:05.900
<v Speaker 8>If my mother wanted to move in,</v>

2998
01:18:05.901 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 8>I mean it would be no problem.</v>

2999
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.640
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

3000
01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 8>I think we all have to kind of take care of her mom,</v>

3001
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:11.250
<v Speaker 8>but at some point don't,</v>

3002
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:12.740
<v Speaker 8>we're taking care of my mom.</v>

3003
01:18:12.741 --> 01:18:13.940
<v Speaker 8>My mom took care of my mom.</v>

3004
01:18:13.941 --> 01:18:14.920
<v Speaker 8>My mom could live with me.</v>

3005
01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:15.531
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3006
01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 8>So I think we're not going to have to do it.</v>

3007
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:19.130
<v Speaker 8>She's not like tell you what to do.</v>

3008
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 8>Watch over your business mom.</v>

3009
01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:24.740
<v Speaker 8>Like some people have moms that are like really like invasive start problems are</v>

3010
01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:24.980
<v Speaker 8>alive.</v>

3011
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:25.840
<v Speaker 8>I have friends whose,</v>

3012
01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.950
<v Speaker 8>who literally can't talk to their moms because their moms,</v>

3013
01:18:27.951 --> 01:18:29.130
<v Speaker 8>we'll start drama in their lives.</v>

3014
01:18:29.131 --> 01:18:29.540
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3015
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.321
<v Speaker 8>And start picking them.</v>

3016
01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:31.440
<v Speaker 8>The girlfriend or picking on the,</v>

3017
01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

3018
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:32.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3019
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:33.460
<v Speaker 5>And they don't know how to break that habit.</v>

3020
01:18:33.461 --> 01:18:34.980
<v Speaker 5>They've been doing it their whole lives.</v>

3021
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 5>But then you get old enough and you realize that,</v>

3022
01:18:36.981 --> 01:18:38.500
<v Speaker 5>that that behavior's insane.</v>

3023
01:18:38.501 --> 01:18:38.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3024
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:43.790
<v Speaker 8>You form patterns in your head based on certain ways of behaving that you've</v>

3025
01:18:44.281 --> 01:18:48.300
<v Speaker 8>always followed in these grooves in the past and they can be totally shitty</v>

3026
01:18:48.301 --> 01:18:48.840
<v Speaker 8>grooves.</v>

3027
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.220
<v Speaker 8>I personally,</v>

3028
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:51.220
<v Speaker 8>when I was younger,</v>

3029
01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.050
<v Speaker 8>had a bunch of Shitty grooves that I had to get my own mind out of.</v>

3030
01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:55.770
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3031
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:58.440
<v Speaker 8>I had a bunch of like jealousy grooves,</v>

3032
01:18:58.441 --> 01:18:59.730
<v Speaker 8>hater grooves,</v>

3033
01:18:59.731 --> 01:19:01.170
<v Speaker 8>feeling sorry for myself.</v>

3034
01:19:01.171 --> 01:19:04.410
<v Speaker 8>Grooves like a self defeating thoughts,</v>

3035
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.263
<v Speaker 8>grooves.</v>

3036
01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Totally normal.</v>

3037
01:19:07.021 --> 01:19:08.610
<v Speaker 5>And as long as you're interested in,</v>

3038
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:08.971
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3039
01:19:08.971 --> 01:19:10.590
<v Speaker 5>making yourself better than</v>

3040
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.460
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3041
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.990
<v Speaker 8>But you've got to recognize them and dump them in.</v>

3042
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:14.721
<v Speaker 8>That's what it is.</v>

3043
01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:15.620
<v Speaker 8>And some people don't.</v>

3044
01:19:15.621 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 8>And so they find themselves an old lady,</v>

3045
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:17.691
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3046

3178
01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:18.010
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like some sort of a gang and uh,</v>

01:22:19.191 --> 01:22:22.220
<v Speaker 5>they hit me and like their bathroom and then he came there and was making a</v>

3183
01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:22.581
<v Speaker 5>scene.</v>

3184
01:22:22.581 --> 01:22:26.390
<v Speaker 5>So the guys threw me out because they didn't want the cops to come and he wound</v>

3185
01:22:26.391 --> 01:22:27.770
<v Speaker 5>up getting in a fist fight with them.</v>

3186
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.940
<v Speaker 5>End of the night.</v>

3187
01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.290
<v Speaker 5>We're back at our apartment.</v>

3188
01:22:30.291 --> 01:22:31.640
<v Speaker 5>We lived together in Santa Barbara.</v>

3189
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:36.440
<v Speaker 5>He starts breaking classes over his own head.</v>

3190
01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.380
<v Speaker 5>And then I finally find a way to run out of the apartment.</v>

3191
01:22:39.381 --> 01:22:41.030
<v Speaker 5>And he was chasing me with a knife,</v>

3192
01:22:41.031 --> 01:22:45.380
<v Speaker 5>like American psycho chasing me around our apartment complex.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh is your real feeling like that?</v>

3263
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:20.520
<v Speaker 5>Like when a guy doesn't do anything crazy or violent that he's not really you?</v>

3264
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:20.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3265
01:24:20.951 --> 01:24:23.020

3266
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:25.390
<v Speaker 5>like being really fucked up by this relationship.</v>

3267
01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:27.610
<v Speaker 5>So that's why when someone's like really did feel that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3269
01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:29.253

3270
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.820
<v Speaker 5>I really felt believed that because they weren't spitting on your warrant,</v>

3271
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.070
<v Speaker 5>violent towards your core.</v>

3272
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.490
<v Speaker 5>That whole next year I was confused.</v>

3273
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.370
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think that the guy I was dating really cared about me because of that.</v>

3274
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:43.630
<v Speaker 5>And the guy was dating.</v>

3324
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I've even said anything to anyone in a relationship that I regret.</v>

3388
01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:12.621
<v Speaker 3>relationship is.</v>

3399
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I got every lesson in one dude.</v>

3403
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:28.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's fascinating to watch people,</v>

3404
01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:29.970
<v Speaker 3>you know when you,</v>

3405
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 3>you get close to somebody,</v>

3406
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:32.300

3407
01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.090
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden within like a month or two months,</v>

3408
01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:38.300
<v Speaker 3>you're hanging out with him every day and you're like deepen their life.</v>

3409
01:27:38.370 --> 01:27:40.730

3462

<v Speaker 3>Hard and strong.</v>

3506
01:29:40.931 --> 01:29:42.730

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:44.821
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3511
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:45.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

01:29:45.091 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 3>you just look at a guy and you go,</v>

3515
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:48.953
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

3516
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:49.441
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3517
01:29:49.441 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people I didn't know,</v>

3518
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:51.510
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3519
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:52.560
<v Speaker 3>he had a thumb ring.</v>

3520
01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 3>That's all it take for me.</v>

3521
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:55.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3522
01:29:55.951 --> 01:29:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I have a wallet chain.</v>

3523
01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm really glass houses.</v>

3524
01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:58.853
<v Speaker 3>I'm throwing rocks.</v>

3525
01:29:58.890 --> 01:29:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a wall chains.</v>

3526
01:29:59.931 --> 01:30:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's nothing.</v>

3527
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:01.230
<v Speaker 3>It's no fun.</v>

3528
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:04.810
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty had a submarine and he was wearing leather flip flops and a pony</v>

3529
01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:05.644
<v Speaker 3>tail.</v>

3530
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 3>And when he talks,</v>

3531
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:07.854
<v Speaker 3>he was my manager</v>

3532
01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.980
<v Speaker 7>over exaggerate like the of the,</v>

3533
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.730
<v Speaker 7>the name of a country that's in Mozambique.</v>

3534
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3535
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 3>I just really like on a sec.</v>

3536
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 7>Then I found out that he was living off the alimony from a rich woman that he</v>

3537
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:23.420
<v Speaker 7>had married.</v>

3538
01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:23.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3539
01:30:23.721 --> 01:30:24.051
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3540
01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:24.770
<v Speaker 3>it all adds up.</v>

3541
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:25.603
<v Speaker 3>It all adds up.</v>

3542
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Well this is hilarious.</v>

3543
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.760
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing when you just see a guy's like a,</v>

3544
01:30:29.761 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 7>like a male hustlers type character.</v>

3545
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:32.401
<v Speaker 7>And I saw him,</v>

3546
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:33.240
<v Speaker 7>I observed him,</v>

3547
01:30:33.241 --> 01:30:33.781
<v Speaker 7>I watched him,</v>

3548
01:30:33.781 --> 01:30:36.540
<v Speaker 7>I followed him around because I was fascinated by him cause he was fabulous.</v>

3549
01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.490
<v Speaker 7>He went over to these mothers.</v>

3550
01:30:38.491 --> 01:30:38.790
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

3551
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.020
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3552
01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.910
<v Speaker 7>although all these mothers were hanging around and,</v>

3553
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.071
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3554
01:30:41.071 --> 01:30:43.380
<v Speaker 7>he's fairly decent looking guy and uh,</v>

3555
01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:43.681
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3556
01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:46.900
<v Speaker 7>it just goes over and tries to talk really seriously.</v>

3557
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.820
<v Speaker 7>This is a wow,</v>

3558
01:30:47.821 --> 01:30:49.890
<v Speaker 7>what a beautiful ensemble.</v>

3559
01:30:49.891 --> 01:30:50.071
<v Speaker 7>What,</v>

3560
01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:50.400
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3561
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.630
<v Speaker 7>an amazing bouquet of flowers and sensitively put,</v>

3562
01:30:54.631 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 7>they're just so beautiful.</v>

3563
01:30:55.771 --> 01:30:56.060
<v Speaker 7>So many.</v>

3564
01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:56.893
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3565
01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:57.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3566
01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.780
<v Speaker 3>well not this chick.</v>

3567
01:30:59.870 --> 01:31:03.710
<v Speaker 3>A guy that was collecting alimony from a woman is not a man,</v>

3568
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.990
<v Speaker 3>not a man.</v>

3569
01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.790
<v Speaker 3>And women should be doing it either.</v>

3570
01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.020
<v Speaker 3>It seems awful.</v>

3571
01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3572
01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:09.531
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3573
01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:09.861
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3574
01:31:09.861 --> 01:31:10.521
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>

3575
01:31:10.521 --> 01:31:12.950
<v Speaker 3>If a man is taken care of a woman and she has kids,</v>

3576
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:15.590
<v Speaker 3>or if you told her she doesn't have to work,</v>

3577
01:31:15.591 --> 01:31:16.011
<v Speaker 3>I'm rich,</v>

3578
01:31:16.011 --> 01:31:16.551
<v Speaker 3>come with me.</v>

3579
01:31:16.551 --> 01:31:17.160
<v Speaker 3>And then she's like,</v>

3580
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.100
<v Speaker 3>do you ever send money to get her shit back together again?</v>

3581
01:31:19.101 --> 01:31:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody deserves,</v>

3582
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:21.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3583
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody deserves to,</v>

3584
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:26.240
<v Speaker 3>to be fucked up and on skid row or what have you.</v>

3585
01:31:26.241 --> 01:31:29.540
<v Speaker 3>If there's a way to avoid it where the other person could just be a decent and</v>

3586
01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:30.374
<v Speaker 3>moral person.</v>

3587
01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:31.533
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3588
01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.920
<v Speaker 3>Breakups are so bad for the most part.</v>

3589
01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:35.480
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times people don't want to help.</v>

3590
01:31:35.481 --> 01:31:38.300
<v Speaker 3>The other person and want them to be a fucking homeless person.</v>

3591
01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.730
<v Speaker 3>They need the courts to kind of step in.</v>

3592
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:41.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3593
01:31:41.491 --> 01:31:42.324
<v Speaker 3>But that dude,</v>

3594
01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.320
<v Speaker 3>but like that dude at the party,</v>

3595
01:31:45.321 --> 01:31:49.790
<v Speaker 3>like I've had guys that like that do well.</v>

3596
01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:53.460
<v Speaker 3>You know some guys that are a little bit famous and you see how they're,</v>

3597
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:55.430
<v Speaker 3>their shit would work on somebody else.</v>

3598
01:31:55.431 --> 01:31:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3599
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:56.120
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3600
01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.410

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:34.671
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3630
01:32:34.671 --> 01:32:35.510
<v Speaker 8>not even Russell brackets.</v>

3631
01:32:35.511 --> 01:32:35.991
<v Speaker 8>Brussel vans.</v>

3632
01:32:35.991 --> 01:32:36.620
<v Speaker 8>Always funny.</v>

3633
01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:36.861
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

3634
01:32:36.861 --> 01:32:37.600
<v Speaker 8>But I mean like,</v>

3635
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.300
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

3636
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.133

01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:41.200
<v Speaker 8>But he plays a wild douche bag guys.</v>

3639
01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:42.050
<v Speaker 8>And even wild,</v>

3640
01:32:42.051 --> 01:32:42.870
<v Speaker 8>he's just a mile.</v>

3641
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:45.170
<v Speaker 5>Does that guy like himself like,</v>

3642
01:32:45.171 --> 01:32:45.691
<v Speaker 5>or does he,</v>

3643
01:32:45.691 --> 01:32:47.070
<v Speaker 5>when he's alone in the bathroom,</v>

3644
01:32:47.071 --> 01:32:50.580
<v Speaker 5>does he look in the mirror and you have to keep himself from sobbing?</v>

3645
01:32:50.610 --> 01:32:51.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3646
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:51.751
<v Speaker 5>I hope so.</v>

3647
01:32:51.751 --> 01:32:53.310
<v Speaker 5>You can only hope that guy hates himself.</v>

3648
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:53.661
<v Speaker 8>If,</v>

3649
01:32:53.661 --> 01:32:56.060
<v Speaker 8>if anyone ever assaulted him on the street who would just quit,</v>

3650
01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.200
<v Speaker 8>he would curl up in a ball.</v>

3651
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:58.190
<v Speaker 8>It's just,</v>

3652
01:32:58.190 --> 01:32:59.870
<v Speaker 8>if you just had one thing to him,</v>

3653
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.261
<v Speaker 8>he's,</v>

3654
01:33:00.261 --> 01:33:01.580
<v Speaker 8>if someone attacked him physically,</v>

3655
01:33:01.581 --> 01:33:02.390
<v Speaker 8>he would fall apart.</v>

3656
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:04.850
<v Speaker 8>That's why like when those guys are in my audience.</v>

3657
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:06.920
<v Speaker 8>So this guy became my science project for the party,</v>

3658
01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:08.723
<v Speaker 8>which I did.</v>

3659
01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.441
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

3660
01:33:09.441 --> 01:33:10.210
<v Speaker 8>I was thinking about,</v>

3661
01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:11.390
<v Speaker 8>I'll start twittering about it.</v>

3662
01:33:11.391 --> 01:33:13.010
<v Speaker 8>I tweeted about it while I was falling the sky.</v>

3663
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.400
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3664
01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:13.881
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

3665
01:33:13.881 --> 01:33:14.060
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3666
01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:18.320
<v Speaker 8>I watched him talk to a young boy and that's where it's shit got really</v>

3667
01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:19.590
<v Speaker 8>interesting because,</v>

3668
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.820
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3669
01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:20.061
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3670
01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:20.271
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

3671
01:33:20.271 --> 01:33:21.104
<v Speaker 8>not like that.</v>

3672
01:33:22.190 --> 01:33:23.740
<v Speaker 8>Like the kid was,</v>

3673
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:25.520
<v Speaker 8>I should say a teenager.</v>

3674
01:33:25.521 --> 01:33:28.220
<v Speaker 8>The kid was about it probably like 18 watch for 20 minutes.</v>

3675
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.230
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

3676
01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:30.380
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3677
01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.180
<v Speaker 8>they were talking about things and you know,</v>

3678
01:33:32.181 --> 01:33:32.371
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

3679
01:33:32.371 --> 01:33:35.480
<v Speaker 8>the guy was doing his sort of smoldering thing with them and you know,</v>

3680
01:33:35.481 --> 01:33:36.710
<v Speaker 8>being wise and,</v>

3681
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.750
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

3682
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:38.750
<v Speaker 8>the kid asked him,</v>

3683
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.860
<v Speaker 8>what do you do?</v>

3684
01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:41.410
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3685
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:42.700
<v Speaker 8>And he didn't answer.</v>

3686
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.040
<v Speaker 8>He didn't answer.</v>

3687
01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:44.801
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't do anything.</v>

3688
01:33:44.801 --> 01:33:45.581
<v Speaker 8>He had like,</v>

3689
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:46.414
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3690
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:47.860
<v Speaker 8>like a little pause a,</v>

3691
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:48.430
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3692
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.350
<v Speaker 8>and it was really crazy.</v>

3693
01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:51.251
<v Speaker 8>And then he,</v>

3694
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 8>the kid asked him again like he tried to like change the subject or he tried to</v>

3695
01:33:54.851 --> 01:33:56.380
<v Speaker 8>like add something yeah.</v>

3696
01:33:56.410 --> 01:33:57.850
<v Speaker 8>To the past statement that he,</v>

3697
01:33:57.851 --> 01:33:58.001
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3698
01:33:58.001 --> 01:33:58.221
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

3699
01:33:58.221 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 8>the previous sentence on the right to finish it as if the guy didn't ask him</v>

3700
01:34:01.691 --> 01:34:02.524
<v Speaker 8>what he do.</v>

3701
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:04.090
<v Speaker 8>And then the kid asked again,</v>

3702
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:05.230
<v Speaker 8>what do you do?</v>

3703
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.800
<v Speaker 8>And then he had this sort of a stutter and we're working in developing property.</v>

3704
01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:12.330
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3705
01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:13.163
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3706
01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:13.420
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3707
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.150
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what it is,</v>

3708
01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:14.871
<v Speaker 5>what the truth is.</v>

3709
01:34:14.871 --> 01:34:15.171
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3710
01:34:15.171 --> 01:34:18.240
<v Speaker 5>I am journaling and going to whole foods twice a day.</v>

3711
01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:18.870
<v Speaker 8>Well it was a,</v>

3712
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 8>it was a fascinating dude because he was doing it again.</v>

3713
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.920
<v Speaker 8>He had gotten one rich woman to marry him and then he was there at the party</v>

3714
01:34:25.931 --> 01:34:27.100
<v Speaker 8>with an older rich woman.</v>

3715
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.740
<v Speaker 8>Ah,</v>

3716
01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.573
<v Speaker 8>that's fascinating.</v>

3717
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:29.210
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3718
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:30.820
<v Speaker 8>Setting a woman.</v>

3719
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.450
<v Speaker 8>Fascinating.</v>

3720
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:32.560
<v Speaker 8>People are so sad.</v>

3721
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:33.161
<v Speaker 8>Well it's,</v>

3722
01:34:33.161 --> 01:34:33.580
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3723
01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:34.840
<v Speaker 8>people need things in some,</v>

3724
01:34:34.841 --> 01:34:35.171
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3725
01:34:35.171 --> 01:34:36.660
<v Speaker 8>some women don't need a us,</v>

3726
01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:39.350
<v Speaker 8>a guy who some wild motherfucker was going to run away.</v>

3727
01:34:39.570 --> 01:34:40.660
<v Speaker 8>You need some bitch ass.</v>

3728
01:34:40.661 --> 01:34:42.170
<v Speaker 8>It needs you to pay the bills and pretending.</v>

3729
01:34:42.171 --> 01:34:43.004
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3730
01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:43.971
<v Speaker 5>Well there was like that,</v>

3731
01:34:43.971 --> 01:34:48.050
<v Speaker 5>this whole article in the Atlantic magazine about how we used to think of it</v>

3732
01:34:48.051 --> 01:34:50.390
<v Speaker 5>being like part of the black culture that um,</v>

3733
01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.170
<v Speaker 5>that it would be like the dudes were either playboys,</v>

3734
01:34:54.171 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 5>like if they're successful,</v>

3735
01:34:55.221 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 5>like they can have lots of chicks or a deadbeat.</v>

3736
01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 5>Like you would have to kind of,</v>

3737
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:00.080
<v Speaker 5>as a woman who is successful,</v>

3738
01:35:00.081 --> 01:35:02.920
<v Speaker 5>you have to like take on a deadbeat or cheese and it should,</v>

3739
01:35:02.921 --> 01:35:03.350
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

3740
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:04.340
<v Speaker 5>but it's not anymore.</v>

3741
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 5>That's totally everybody.</v>

3742
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:07.520
<v Speaker 5>It's not just for one community.</v>

3743
01:35:07.521 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how it is now.</v>

3744
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:09.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3745
01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:09.711

01:38:38.521 --> 01:38:39.354
<v Speaker 8>It all is.</v>

3889
01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:41.250
<v Speaker 8>And then instead of a guy like this,</v>

3890
01:38:41.251 --> 01:38:41.521
<v Speaker 8>then yeah,</v>

3891
01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:42.261
<v Speaker 8>I guess it's pretty good.</v>

3892
01:38:42.261 --> 01:38:43.094
<v Speaker 8>I'll just drop a load here.</v>

3893
01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.080
<v Speaker 8>Doesn't seem very enthusiastic.</v>

3894
01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 8>Not very complementary.</v>

3895
01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:48.781
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't,</v>

3896
01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:50.070
<v Speaker 8>I don't think I would take it personally.</v>

3897
01:38:56.110 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 8>That excited about to cut you off for a week and see if we could pick up the</v>

3898
01:39:00.031 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 8>volume soldier.</v>

3899
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.500
<v Speaker 8>Some girls were into that though.</v>

3900
01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:05.280
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3901
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.420
<v Speaker 8>Some girls like big loads.</v>

3902
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.823
<v Speaker 8>They find that Brian.</v>

3903
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:08.110
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3904
01:39:08.110 --> 01:39:08.640
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

3905
01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.890
<v Speaker 8>I think that don't like the thick ones.</v>

3906
01:39:10.891 --> 01:39:11.131
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3907
01:39:11.131 --> 01:39:13.080
<v Speaker 8>once in a while when you don't have a lot of water.</v>

3908
01:39:13.081 --> 01:39:14.060
<v Speaker 8>You've been drinking a lot.</v>

3909
01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:16.050
<v Speaker 8>It's so unhealthy dude.</v>

3910
01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.180
<v Speaker 8>Really Thick Yogurt.</v>

3911
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:19.591
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3912
01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:20.880
<v Speaker 8>like it's like almost like lumpy,</v>

3913
01:39:20.881 --> 01:39:23.760
<v Speaker 8>like mashed potato or cottage cheesy or something like that.</v>

3914
01:39:23.761 --> 01:39:24.900
<v Speaker 8>Frozen yogurt loads.</v>

3915
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.153
<v Speaker 8>I love that.</v>

3916
01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:29.890
<v Speaker 8>It's like great.</v>

3917
01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.950
<v Speaker 8>It's funny that some girls actually do like loads.</v>

3918
01:39:37.951 --> 01:39:39.120
<v Speaker 8>They like the swallow.</v>

3919
01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:44.003
<v Speaker 8>Some girls love it.</v>

3920
01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 8>It's like their favorite thing.</v>

3921
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.044
<v Speaker 8>Loads of their mouth.</v>

3922
01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:50.420
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3923
01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 8>The summer you've had a few coronas,</v>

3924
01:39:52.711 --> 01:39:53.700
<v Speaker 8>you could use the salt.</v>

3925
01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 8>Is it good for your skin?</v>

3926
01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 8>Is that I look so young,</v>

3927
01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:02.610
<v Speaker 8>Joe.</v>

3928
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 8>That's why you guys say that.</v>

3929
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:05.323
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3930
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.111
<v Speaker 8>I would think so.</v>

3931
01:40:07.111 --> 01:40:08.430
<v Speaker 8>Probably do just as good a job.</v>

3932
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:13.600
<v Speaker 8>Is that shit real boy?</v>

3933
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.990
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3934
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.740
<v Speaker 8>That's a legit,</v>

3935
01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 8>is it still around?</v>

3936
01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:21.330
<v Speaker 8>Isn't that like supposed to keep women a young forever.</v>

3937
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 8>I've got something better that you should try.</v>

3938
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:25.610
<v Speaker 8>We'll talk.</v>

3939
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:26.443
<v Speaker 8>I don't think so.</v>

3940
01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.650
<v Speaker 8>Do you guys remember the Solo Flex woman?</v>

3941
01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:29.640
<v Speaker 8>There was like a 50 year old.</v>

3942
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember that pitch was hot and she was like 50 and she's on cougar life</v>

3943
01:40:34.471 --> 01:40:35.304
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

3944
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.930
<v Speaker 8>You think she's still rocking it when you're 50 and like 2003 that's a long time</v>

3945
01:40:39.931 --> 01:40:40.764
<v Speaker 8>ago man.</v>

3946
01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:42.300
<v Speaker 8>Back then you were hot,</v>

3947
01:40:42.301 --> 01:40:44.190
<v Speaker 8>but the wall is near.</v>

3948
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:46.590
<v Speaker 8>Not much you can do about that.</v>

3949
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.780
<v Speaker 8>You know God aging as a woman just seems like so often it's a mother fucker for</v>

3950
01:40:51.781 --> 01:40:53.280
<v Speaker 8>everybody and that's going to,</v>

3951
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.123
<v Speaker 8>how old are you?</v>

3952
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.980
<v Speaker 3>30 there's no getting around it either.</v>

3953
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.711
<v Speaker 3>Five more years.</v>

3954
01:40:56.711 --> 01:40:57.340
<v Speaker 3>So you hit the wall.</v>

3955
01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.910
<v Speaker 3>You think exercise is the only thing so nice.</v>

3956
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>You can hold it off a little bit.</v>

3957
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:02.290
<v Speaker 3>If you stay in shape,</v>

3958
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.930
<v Speaker 3>hold it off a little bit.</v>

3959
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Run.</v>

3960
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that keeps people young.</v>

3961
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3962
01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:06.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3963
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 3>But your knees are going to get jacked.</v>

3964
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.470
<v Speaker 3>You run on the concrete.</v>

3965
01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Are you running on?</v>

3966
01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:09.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3967
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:11.410
<v Speaker 3>I run either on the treadmill or a dirt.</v>

3968
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:11.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3969
01:41:11.521 --> 01:41:12.030
<v Speaker 3>that's thing.</v>

3970
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3971
01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I use my stuff.</v>

3972
01:41:13.721 --> 01:41:15.230
<v Speaker 3>I roll on just to sleep in our children.</v>

3973
01:41:15.231 --> 01:41:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Run on your toes,</v>

3974
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 3>you know they say like those toe shoes.</v>

3975
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:19.270
<v Speaker 3>That's really the way to run.</v>

3976
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3977
01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:20.890
<v Speaker 3>but then I'll be a douche bag.</v>

3978
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you have those shoes?</v>

3979
01:41:23.761 --> 01:41:24.161
<v Speaker 3>I have them,</v>

3980
01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:24.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3981
01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:25.163
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

3982
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't wear 'em except to work out.</v>

3983
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to work out.</v>

3984
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3985
01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kick the back.</v>

3986
01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes if it's cold outside really are like little piglet,</v>

3987
01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:35.170
<v Speaker 3>but Jim is in my garage and sometimes it's like if it's 40 degrees out,</v>

3988
01:41:35.171 --> 01:41:36.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm working out at 40 degrees.</v>

3989
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:40.870
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to kick a leather bag with serious fitness.</v>

3990
01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:41.231
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

3991
01:41:41.231 --> 01:41:42.500
<v Speaker 3>When I see people like running,</v>

3992
01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I see people running around central park in those footies and I'm just right</v>

3993
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.550
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3994
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Is it helping you that much?</v>

3995
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:50.700
<v Speaker 2>What it is is the,</v>

3996
01:41:50.701 --> 01:41:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the way people run is an unnatural way.</v>

3997
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:57.140
<v Speaker 2>The way people run where you go heal and then down to your toes.</v>

3998
01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3999
01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>That's not how you run.</v>

4000
01:41:58.491 --> 01:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>If you were running out barefoot in the world,</v>

4001
01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:00.990
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4002
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.310
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

4003
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:05.510
<v Speaker 2>you would run and you would use the natural design of your foot as a shock</v>

4004
01:42:05.511 --> 01:42:06.344
<v Speaker 2>absorber.</v>

4005
01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's what people do instead of drop down on your heel because you have a</v>

4006
01:42:09.441 --> 01:42:10.460
<v Speaker 2>big pad there.</v>

4007
01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4008
01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Because a shoe company has put an artificial pad in the back of your heel.</v>

4009
01:42:13.941 --> 01:42:14.270
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4010
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:16.070
<v Speaker 2>they literally changed the way people run.</v>

4011
01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:16.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4012
01:42:16.191 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 2>But don't we offer that before that people would have to run and do.</v>

4013
01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:22.250
<v Speaker 2>The natural way to do is to land on the ball of your foot and you,</v>

4014
01:42:22.251 --> 01:42:23.780
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the design of the foot,</v>

4015
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.860
<v Speaker 2>your foot bends and gives you land on the toe and the ball of the foot and then</v>

4016
01:42:27.861 --> 01:42:30.320
<v Speaker 2>it gives and what these shoes and any,</v>

4017
01:42:30.321 --> 01:42:33.650
<v Speaker 2>any barefoot like exercise program.</v>

4018
01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I lift weights barefoot and a I'll do,</v>

4019
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4020
01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different things,</v>

4021
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.741
<v Speaker 2>different exercises,</v>

4022
01:42:39.741 --> 01:42:40.131
<v Speaker 2>barefoot.</v>

4023
01:42:40.131 --> 01:42:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And the idea behind it is that that is that that's a natural way for your body</v>

4024
01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:46.340
<v Speaker 2>to carry stress and to move things around.</v>

4025
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:49.160
<v Speaker 2>And that if you run on the ball of your foot like that,</v>

4026
01:42:49.190 --> 01:42:53.210
<v Speaker 2>it actually saves your body all the damage that a lot of people get from the</v>

4027
01:42:53.211 --> 01:42:55.680
<v Speaker 2>pounding of a of knees.</v>

4028
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.770
<v Speaker 2>So that's why the tone wasn't the natural way.</v>

4029
01:42:57.771 --> 01:42:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Not Be on concrete though.</v>

4030
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4031
01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:00.411
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>

4032
01:43:00.411 --> 01:43:03.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's just like a fucking concrete concretes,</v>

4033
01:43:03.051 --> 01:43:04.520
<v Speaker 2>bad period for anybody,</v>

4034
01:43:04.521 --> 01:43:05.360
<v Speaker 2>any way you run.</v>

4035
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.841
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

4036
01:43:05.841 --> 01:43:06.560
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

4037
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.150
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give nice dirt.</v>

4038
01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're on it like a nice dirt hill,</v>

4039
01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>you know when you hit that thing,</v>

4040
01:43:11.661 --> 01:43:13.190
<v Speaker 2>it compacts a little compact.</v>

4041
01:43:13.191 --> 01:43:16.790
<v Speaker 2>So there's a nice dirt hill near a house that I used to run until there was</v>

4042
01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:19.100
<v Speaker 2>three fucking mountain lions signings in my neighborhood.</v>

4043
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.360
<v Speaker 3>The routine now running this hill anymore.</v>

4044
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:23.250
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

4045
01:43:23.250 --> 01:43:25.060
<v Speaker 3>it was a nice steep dirt hill.</v>

4046
01:43:25.061 --> 01:43:29.620
<v Speaker 3>And you could feel it give as you ran into her in the sand.</v>

4047
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:30.161
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4048
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:30.390
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4049
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Running in the sand is fantastic for you.</v>

4050
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4051
01:43:32.290 --> 01:43:32.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4052
01:43:32.531 --> 01:43:33.580
<v Speaker 3>you've got to build your body up.</v>

4053
01:43:33.581 --> 01:43:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's not shame.</v>

4054
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4055
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I loved running on the beach and then like barefoot.</v>

4056
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:40.660
<v Speaker 3>But then I heard like who told you there's anything wrong with that?</v>

4057
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Sand is great.</v>

4058
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:42.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4059
01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say piece of advice.</v>

4060
01:43:44.021 --> 01:43:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to probably go get those shoes running.</v>

4061
01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:47.773
<v Speaker 3>The sand is hard.</v>

4062
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:48.610
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to run.</v>

4063
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean as long as you don't step on something.</v>

4064
01:43:50.321 --> 01:43:50.910
<v Speaker 3>But if you know,</v>

4065
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:50.990
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

4066
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.380
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

4067
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:54.380
<v Speaker 3>if you step on something you're fuck broken bottles and shedding me if you trust</v>

4068
01:43:54.381 --> 01:43:55.214
<v Speaker 3>the beach.</v>

4069
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.130
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a,</v>

4070
01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:57.280
<v Speaker 3>if you're running barefoot in the sand,</v>

4071
01:43:57.281 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 3>it's really good for you.</v>

4072
01:43:58.130 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

4073
01:43:58.610 --> 01:43:58.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4074
01:43:58.881 --> 01:44:00.250
<v Speaker 3>So was running sand dunes.</v>

4075
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:02.090
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking up incredibly good for you.</v>

4076
01:44:02.091 --> 01:44:02.301
<v Speaker 3>It's me.</v>

4077
01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Insane is,</v>

4078
01:44:03.531 --> 01:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm always in hotels of course.</v>

4079
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 3>And in hotel gyms when people just come in to just check it out,</v>

4080
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.090
<v Speaker 3>don't you always see like couple of things they just like,</v>

4081
01:44:11.091 --> 01:44:12.000
<v Speaker 3>they'll come down like that.</v>

4082
01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:13.773
<v Speaker 3>It's like it,</v>

4083
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.631
<v Speaker 3>that's a gym.</v>

4084
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:15.431
<v Speaker 3>Like you can tell how,</v>

4085
01:44:15.431 --> 01:44:16.850
<v Speaker 3>how nice the hotel is.</v>

4086
01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.380
<v Speaker 3>You're going to know how nice the gym,</v>

4087
01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.160
<v Speaker 3>like what do you,</v>

4088
01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:19.491
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

4089
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:20.001
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

4090
01:44:20.001 --> 01:44:21.200
<v Speaker 3>It just makes me so mad.</v>

4091
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Why you don't like being looked at why you're a oils.</v>

4092
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I love being.</v>

4095
01:44:25.541 --> 01:44:26.890
<v Speaker 8>They just come in and they don't commit.</v>

4096
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.753
<v Speaker 8>They don't send,</v>

4097
01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.040
<v Speaker 8>someone's going to flirt with me while we trained together.</v>

<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

4102

<v Speaker 8>That's what cool thing about these mirrors there in the corners.</v>

4103

<v Speaker 8>You just look one way.</v>

4104

<v Speaker 8>You're upset that the people come in where they just look because they're not</v>

4127
01:45:18.641 --> 01:45:19.510
<v Speaker 8>going to play your game.</v>

4128

<v Speaker 8>Co Director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University.</v>

4221
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:04.440
<v Speaker 8>For instance,</v>

4222
01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.180
<v Speaker 8>Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues first reported the phenomenon in 1953 saying</v>

4223
01:48:09.181 --> 01:48:12.930
<v Speaker 8>about 5% of women they had interviewed mentioned orgasm linked to physical</v>

4224
01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 8>exercise.</v>

4225
01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.100
<v Speaker 8>Wow,</v>

01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:17.880
<v Speaker 8>what is the spring?</v>

4229
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:22.440
<v Speaker 8>The report of so called core orgasms named because of their seeming link.</v>

4230
01:48:22.441 --> 01:48:27.270
<v Speaker 8>Two exercises for core abdominal muscles have circulated in the media for years</v>

4231
01:48:27.271 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 8>according to the researchers.</v>

4232
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.450
<v Speaker 8>So apparently it's working your core.</v>

4233
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:33.270
<v Speaker 8>So the getting on the knees and tightening up the pussy.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4238
01:48:37.291 --> 01:48:40.080
<v Speaker 8>And I don't want you to rock your ass back to your heels.</v>

4239
01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:40.471
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4240
01:48:40.471 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 8>Pull yourself up with your abs while you're squeezing your pussy.</v>

4241
01:48:44.010 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 8>Why don't I just rub my clit?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

4542
01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I've never been with a black guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's got a lot of black and lesbian friends,</v>

4544
01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.510
<v Speaker 3>so he's got mixed.</v>

4545
01:56:05.511 --> 01:56:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you need,</v>

4546
01:56:06.361 --> 01:56:07.041
<v Speaker 3>that's going to shock you.</v>

4547
01:56:07.041 --> 01:56:07.874
<v Speaker 3>Parents,</v>

4548
01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:08.713
<v Speaker 3>Asian girls,</v>

4549
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:09.793
<v Speaker 3>boys and girls.</v>

4550
01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.773
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want.</v>

4551
01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:12.561
<v Speaker 3>So is this,</v>

4552
01:56:12.561 --> 01:56:12.741
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4553
01:56:12.741 --> 01:56:13.570
<v Speaker 3>this thing that happened</v>

4554
01:56:13.570 --> 01:56:14.530
<v Speaker 2>today that I don't totally,</v>

4555
01:56:14.531 --> 01:56:15.460
<v Speaker 2>completely understand,</v>

4556
01:56:15.461 --> 01:56:16.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's some,</v>

4557
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:16.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4558
01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:17.770
<v Speaker 2>new Obama,</v>

4559
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:20.410
<v Speaker 2>a jobs act that he just signed in Matt.</v>

4560
01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:23.860
<v Speaker 2>He be wrote this blog about how fucking terrible it is.</v>

4561
01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:24.873
<v Speaker 2>What's the act?</v>

4562
01:56:25.330 --> 01:56:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't completely understand it.</v>

4563
01:56:26.951 --> 01:56:31.450
<v Speaker 2>But though the way it's been explained to me is that essentially almost</v>

4564
01:56:31.451 --> 01:56:32.770
<v Speaker 2>legalizes fraud.</v>

4565
01:56:33.190 --> 01:56:37.090
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that it used to be if you wanted to take a company public,</v>

4566
01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.810
<v Speaker 2>you had to file all sorts of paperwork and have a hiring an account and have all</v>

4567
01:56:40.811 --> 01:56:43.240
<v Speaker 2>these financial statements in place.</v>

4568
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:46.570
<v Speaker 2>But now they say you don't need to hire an accountant before the company is</v>

4569
01:56:46.571 --> 01:56:47.231
<v Speaker 2>taking public,</v>

4570
01:56:47.231 --> 01:56:50.650
<v Speaker 2>nor do you need to do so for five years after the company goes public.</v>

4571
01:56:50.890 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like you can fucking lie about your financial statements for five</v>

4572
01:56:56.111 --> 01:56:58.840
<v Speaker 2>years without any independent accounting of your claims.</v>

4573
01:56:58.990 --> 01:57:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't totally completely understand it.</v>

4574
01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading,</v>

4575
01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh Matt Taibbi be getting money and lying.</v>

4576
01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:08.500
<v Speaker 2>And when public would things go Publix manipulating the stock market,</v>

4577
01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:09.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4578
01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what,</v>

4579
01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:11.810
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

4580
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:13.330
<v Speaker 2>the pros are of this,</v>

4581
01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:14.560
<v Speaker 2>this thing it might have,</v>

4582
01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:15.091
<v Speaker 2>see when,</v>

4583
01:57:15.091 --> 01:57:17.650
<v Speaker 2>when they sign sign an act is,</v>

4584
01:57:17.651 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 2>there's usually a lot,</v>

4585
01:57:18.511 --> 01:57:18.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4586

01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:21.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not just one statement.</v>

4588
01:57:21.471 --> 01:57:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4589
01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.930
<v Speaker 3>But people said it's out bill one thing and that's,</v>

4590
01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:25.790
<v Speaker 3>they put things in like this.</v>

4591
01:57:25.791 --> 01:57:26.180

<v Speaker 2>It's really strange.</v>

4604
01:57:47.610 --> 01:57:51.610
<v Speaker 2>He equates it and he says it's like formerly eliminating steroid testing for the</v>

4605
01:57:51.611 --> 01:57:53.680
<v Speaker 2>first five years of a baseball player's career.</v>

4606
01:57:53.890 --> 01:57:56.380
<v Speaker 2>You can pretty much bet you're going to see a lot of home runs and those first</v>

4607
01:57:56.381 --> 01:57:58.180
<v Speaker 2>few years after you institute a rule like that,</v>

4608
01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but you better be ready to stick a lot of asterisks in the record books 10 or 15</v>

4609
01:58:03.071 --> 01:58:03.904
<v Speaker 2>years down the line,</v>

4610
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:06.850
<v Speaker 2>which is a great analogy to what if this is correct,</v>

4611
01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.030
<v Speaker 2>if you really don't have to have the proper accounting to,</v>

4612
01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:12.580
<v Speaker 2>to go for a company to go public for the first five years,</v>

4613
01:58:12.581 --> 01:58:13.414
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

4614
01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:14.950
<v Speaker 2>this is craziness.</v>

4615
01:58:15.190 --> 01:58:20.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like they keep passing more and more laws and they keep doing more and more</v>

4616
01:58:20.051 --> 01:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>things to control people and to make it,</v>

4617
01:58:22.810 --> 01:58:25.990
<v Speaker 2>to limit our ability to defend ourselves against the government.</v>

4618
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:29.830
<v Speaker 2>And they keep doing more and more things that allow people to somehow or another</v>

4619
01:58:29.831 --> 01:58:31.450
<v Speaker 2>siphoned money out of the system.</v>

4620
01:58:31.810 --> 01:58:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta wonder where does this end when they stop making new bills and</v>

4621
01:58:36.581 --> 01:58:41.581
<v Speaker 2>start trying to fix this fucking ridiculous government we have.</v>

4622
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:41.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4623
01:58:41.801 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 2>the foreclosure</v>

4624
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.911
<v Speaker 5>bill,</v>

4625
01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:44.290
<v Speaker 5>what we were just talking about with the fork,</v>

4626
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:45.890
<v Speaker 5>the hell those houses foreclosing him.</v>

4627
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:47.320
<v Speaker 5>Obama just pass that,</v>

4628
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.340
<v Speaker 5>that bill.</v>

4629
01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:49.840
<v Speaker 5>What is that a month ago?</v>

4630
01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Was it though?</v>

4631
01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4632
01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 5>it's a good,</v>

4633
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:52.361
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4634
01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:53.410
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was pretty good.</v>

4635
01:58:53.411 --> 01:58:54.160
<v Speaker 5>It sounded pretty good.</v>

4636
01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:54.730
<v Speaker 5>What does it do?</v>

4637
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:55.391
<v Speaker 5>It just like,</v>

4638
01:58:55.391 --> 01:58:55.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4639
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:56.803
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

4640
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:57.100
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

4641
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:57.933
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4642
01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.410
<v Speaker 5>there were a bunch of different facets of it,</v>

4643
01:58:59.411 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 5>but one of it was like your house can be foreclosed on,</v>

4644
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:03.303
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4645
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 5>in the first three years.</v>

4646
01:59:04.301 --> 01:59:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Like if you served in the military,</v>

4647
01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:06.890
<v Speaker 5>like just things that you,</v>

4648
01:59:06.891 --> 01:59:07.361
<v Speaker 5>you were like,</v>

4649
01:59:07.361 --> 01:59:08.650
<v Speaker 5>this wasn't already a rule,</v>

4650
01:59:08.710 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4654
01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:15.280
<v Speaker 7>mental health when people get a chance.</v>

4655
01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:15.690

01:59:19.871 --> 01:59:20.890
<v Speaker 7>I need to know more about this.</v>

4663
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:22.270
<v Speaker 7>I need to know more about this too,</v>

4664
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.440
<v Speaker 7>but I'm what I'm reading right now,</v>

4665
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 7>it's fucking terrifying.</v>

4666
01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:25.511
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>

4667
01:59:25.511 --> 01:59:25.731
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4668
01:59:25.731 --> 01:59:29.470
<v Speaker 7>I see all these things like the national defense authorization act and all these</v>

4669
01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 7>different rules that all are going to allow them to have fucking drones in the</v>

4670
01:59:33.551 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 7>sky in the next 20 years.</v>

4671
01:59:35.141 --> 01:59:37.780
<v Speaker 7>Going to be 30,000 drones flying through the sky.</v>

4672
01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:42.900
<v Speaker 7>What's a drone flying machines that can take video and send back realtime data</v>

4673
01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:47.920
<v Speaker 7>and work on a four g connection or by that time,</v>

4678
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:53.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to keep on being retired.</v>

4679
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.800
<v Speaker 7>It's probably a good mood.</v>

4700
02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:27.120
<v Speaker 7>Could you imagine if we needed each other that way?</v>

4701
02:00:27.210 --> 02:00:28.080
<v Speaker 7>Like we were like,</v>

4702
02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:28.470
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4703

4705
02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.680
<v Speaker 7>One of those electric cars,</v>

4706
02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:33.360
<v Speaker 7>it actually recharges the battery.</v>

4707
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.520
<v Speaker 7>Could you imagine if that's the way humans recharge?</v>

02:00:35.521 --> 02:00:36.250
<v Speaker 7>We gotta fuck.</v>

4709

4710
02:00:38.861 --> 02:00:39.694
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be right.</v>

4711
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:40.603
<v Speaker 7>More appealing.</v>

4712
02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:43.160
<v Speaker 7>What if we start evolving like that and that direction?</v>

4713
02:00:43.161 --> 02:00:43.341
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4714
02:00:43.341 --> 02:00:45.710
<v Speaker 7>they say that people need physical attention.</v>

4715
02:00:45.711 --> 02:00:46.544
<v Speaker 7>You need,</v>

4716
02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.740
<v Speaker 7>you absolutely need affection from other people.</v>

4717
02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:51.170
<v Speaker 7>It's like we did our bodies like needed.</v>

4718
02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.750
<v Speaker 7>It desires it on a core level.</v>

4719
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:56.150
<v Speaker 7>What if it turns into not just that,</v>

4720
02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.080
<v Speaker 7>but you actually need to fuck and then if you don't fuck your body just rots</v>

4721
02:01:00.081 --> 02:01:03.650
<v Speaker 7>away and dies and the only way to keep moving as if you have to have to fuck.</v>

4722
02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.350
<v Speaker 7>You have to fucking,</v>

02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.140
<v Speaker 7>So you'd be mad.</v>

4725
02:01:06.730 --> 02:01:07.880
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] I dunno.</v>

4726
02:01:07.881 --> 02:01:08.700
<v Speaker 7>With Gay Jazz,</v>

4727
02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 7>probably like engineer do some genetic engineering on their loads so that they</v>

4728
02:01:12.921 --> 02:01:15.170
<v Speaker 7>figured out how a guy can absorb it through his ass.</v>

4729
02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.221
<v Speaker 7>We'd have to time it.</v>

4730
02:01:16.221 --> 02:01:16.461
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

4731
02:01:16.461 --> 02:01:17.630
<v Speaker 7>Like what if we go ahead and take a shit?</v>

4732
02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.640
<v Speaker 7>A Chevy shits out,</v>

4733
02:01:19.641 --> 02:01:21.800
<v Speaker 7>all the good sperm and then you don't evolve.</v>

4734
02:01:22.330 --> 02:01:23.720
<v Speaker 7>You got the timing on that.</v>

4735
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.940
<v Speaker 7>Seriously.</v>

4736
02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:28.310
<v Speaker 7>It's not preposterous to think that we would need each.</v>

4737
02:01:28.311 --> 02:01:29.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean we need each other.</v>

4738
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:30.020
<v Speaker 7>I mean we get it.</v>

4739
02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:31.490
<v Speaker 7>You know how you get addicted to sex,</v>

4740
02:01:31.491 --> 02:01:31.761
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4741
02:01:31.761 --> 02:01:32.630
<v Speaker 7>If you're in a relationship,</v>

4742
02:01:32.631 --> 02:01:33.680
<v Speaker 7>when you first started having sex,</v>

4743
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:35.060
<v Speaker 7>especially right in the beginning,</v>

4744
02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.340
<v Speaker 7>don't you feel like it mixed all you think about.</v>

4745
02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:38.001
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

4746
02:01:38.001 --> 02:01:38.491
<v Speaker 7>You start thinking,</v>

4747
02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:39.050
<v Speaker 7>why don't we not?</v>

4748
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 7>When you can't wait to</v>

4749
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.210
<v Speaker 8>get together with each other.</v>

4750
02:01:41.211 --> 02:01:41.540
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4751
02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 5>It's like a total drug.</v>

4752
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:43.101
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4753
02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:44.000
<v Speaker 8>it is like a turtle drug.</v>

4754
02:01:44.150 --> 02:01:48.650
<v Speaker 8>But that's one of the reasons why people are so angry when people leave them.</v>

4755
02:01:48.651 --> 02:01:50.240
<v Speaker 8>It's like you're taking my drug away,</v>

4756
02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:51.560
<v Speaker 8>taking my thing away.</v>

4757
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:52.603
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4758
02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.100
<v Speaker 8>What if it was even more intense than that?</v>

4759
02:01:55.101 --> 02:01:59.900
<v Speaker 8>And it literally got to a point where your body would register very obvious</v>

4760
02:01:59.901 --> 02:02:04.700
<v Speaker 8>changes whether or not you had a sperm inside your body withdrawal and whether a</v>

4761
02:02:04.701 --> 02:02:05.690
<v Speaker 8>guy got rid of it,</v>

4762
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 8>the guy has to get rid of it and it doesn't get rid of it.</v>

4763
02:02:07.761 --> 02:02:08.560
<v Speaker 8>Like he's,</v>

4764
02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 8>it's burning him up,</v>

4765
02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:10.873
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4766
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:13.050
<v Speaker 5>not much different than reality.</v>

4767
02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:16.890
<v Speaker 5>I would rather die than have sex with anybody I've ever had sex with him ever in</v>

4768
02:02:16.891 --> 02:02:17.520
<v Speaker 5>the past.</v>

4769
02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:18.540
<v Speaker 5>Is there a one guy when you look</v>

4770
02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:19.423
<v Speaker 8>back and go,</v>

4771
02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:20.900
<v Speaker 8>that one could have worked out better?</v>

4772
02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:23.630
<v Speaker 8>Maybe I just fucking shut a one for that finger in the ass thing.</v>

4773
02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:25.033
<v Speaker 8>Did what he asked?</v>

4774
02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:25.461
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4775
02:02:25.461 --> 02:02:25.651
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4776
02:02:25.651 --> 02:02:27.830
<v Speaker 5>I've always gone for the finger in the ass.</v>

4777
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4778
02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:29.390
<v Speaker 5>but no.</v>

4779
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.661
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4780
02:02:29.661 --> 02:02:30.494
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4781
02:02:30.850 --> 02:02:32.590
<v Speaker 8>I ask you to do something creepy and you were like,</v>

4782
02:02:32.591 --> 02:02:34.100
<v Speaker 8>that swear I gotta go.</v>

4783
02:02:34.650 --> 02:02:35.330
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

4784
02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:38.870
<v Speaker 5>I think I've ever had anybody asked me something that was too creepy that I said</v>

4785
02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:39.630
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4786
02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:41.310
<v Speaker 8>a girl told me to fuck her client once.</v>

4787
02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:42.601
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

4788
02:02:42.601 --> 02:02:43.434
<v Speaker 8>whoa.</v>

4789
02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:44.521
<v Speaker 8>It was just like,</v>

4790
02:02:44.521 --> 02:02:45.354
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4791
02:02:45.570 --> 02:02:46.403
<v Speaker 8>what did it mean you?</v>

4792
02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.420
<v Speaker 8>Is that what you call it?</v>

4793
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:49.590
<v Speaker 8>Just isn't that what it is?</v>

4794
02:02:49.591 --> 02:02:50.310
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

4795
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.880
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4796
02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.330
<v Speaker 8>I mean</v>

4797
02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:53.020
<v Speaker 5>we change your terminology a little bit.</v>

4798
02:02:53.021 --> 02:02:53.441
<v Speaker 5>Seeing the,</v>

4799
02:02:53.441 --> 02:02:53.771
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

4800
02:02:53.771 --> 02:02:54.650
<v Speaker 5>I talked about this on,</v>

4801
02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:57.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm on o and a uh,</v>

4802
02:02:57.070 --> 02:03:01.420
<v Speaker 5>but I was like dirty texting with a guy and he like,</v>

4803
02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:03.130
<v Speaker 5>and I wrote something like,</v>

4804
02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:03.993
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4805
02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:05.371
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

4806
02:03:05.371 --> 02:03:07.500
<v Speaker 5>I was going to send on his face or something and like,</v>

4807
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:08.353
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4808
02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:09.340
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4809
02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:10.173
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4810
02:03:10.210 --> 02:03:11.980
<v Speaker 5>and he wrote back like,</v>

4811
02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:13.493
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

4812
02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:15.730
<v Speaker 5>but like oral is going to go both ways.</v>

4813
02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:16.931
<v Speaker 5>And I was just like,</v>

4814
02:03:16.931 --> 02:03:21.420
<v Speaker 5>what is this a negotiation like Douche Bro.</v>

4815
02:03:21.730 --> 02:03:22.151
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

4816
02:03:22.151 --> 02:03:25.470
<v Speaker 5>I think when it comes to like talking shit in the bedroom you like,</v>

4817
02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.130
<v Speaker 5>it's got to kind of be,</v>

4818
02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:30.820
<v Speaker 5>anything goes in unless it's complete insanity.</v>

4819
02:03:30.821 --> 02:03:34.840
<v Speaker 5>But I like if a guy's ever mentioned something I've said while having sex after,</v>

4820
02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:35.943
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4821
02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:37.420
<v Speaker 5>are you fucking crazy?</v>

4822
02:03:37.421 --> 02:03:41.710
<v Speaker 5>Like not talk about that is a secret.</v>

4823
02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:45.010
<v Speaker 5>That was a circle of trust that you are like,</v>

4824
02:03:45.011 --> 02:03:46.000
<v Speaker 5>I would never be like,</v>

4825
02:03:46.001 --> 02:03:46.271
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4826
02:03:46.271 --> 02:03:49.030
<v Speaker 5>at dinner after you fuck someone you talk shit.</v>

4827
02:03:49.031 --> 02:03:49.690

4828
02:03:49.690 --> 02:03:52.770
<v Speaker 5>so I'm calling me a whore nonstop.</v>

4829
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:54.730

4830
02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.410
<v Speaker 5>you gotta just keep it,</v>

4831
02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:57.610
<v Speaker 5>keep it in there.</v>

4832
02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.140
<v Speaker 5>If something makes you uncomfortable,</v>

4833
02:03:59.141 --> 02:03:59.651
<v Speaker 5>you have to be like,</v>

4834

<v Speaker 5>that's not cool.</v>

4835
02:04:00.490 --> 02:04:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Don't,</v>

4836

4839
02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:04.521
<v Speaker 8>You pull them aside,</v>

4840
02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:05.980
<v Speaker 8>like when you're having dinner or do like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>five months where there's a lot of tourists that go there because it's less</v>

5320
02:15:51.221 --> 02:15:53.530
<v Speaker 2>money and you take some wild chances.</v>

<v Speaker 3>How often does this take place during your travels then?</v>

5385
02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:53.250
<v Speaker 3>We left the hotel really,</v>

5386
02:17:53.730 --> 02:17:55.740
<v Speaker 3>but there were some people,</v>

5387
02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.820
<v Speaker 3>there were Great Dick Grammars</v>

5388
02:18:13.390 --> 02:18:16.360
<v Speaker 3>carnival cruises also because I would imagine that would be the same</v>

5389
02:18:19.130 --> 02:18:19.690
<v Speaker 3>sandals.</v>

5390
02:18:19.690 --> 02:18:20.351
<v Speaker 3>All couples.</v>

5391
02:18:20.351 --> 02:18:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Those are what did you see any families?</v>

5392
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:22.533
<v Speaker 3>Their</v>

5393
02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:24.880
<v Speaker 3>kids a lot.</v>

5394
02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:26.140
<v Speaker 3>How old can the kid be?</v>

5395
02:18:26.141 --> 02:18:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Can it be 18 no children,</v>

5396
02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:36.800
<v Speaker 3>but then they can drink down there.</v>

5397
02:18:36.890 --> 02:18:38.980
<v Speaker 3>If it's 18 they have crazy drinking loss,</v>

5398
02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:42.340
<v Speaker 3>bring it on the street like New Orleans.</v>

5399
02:18:42.490 --> 02:18:43.820
<v Speaker 3>New Orleans is amazing like that.</v>

5400
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:48.220
<v Speaker 3>And then there's one place in America that I say you should have,</v>

5401
02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:50.140
<v Speaker 3>you should have to have a passport to go to New Orleans.</v>

5402
02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:51.310
<v Speaker 3>This just not America.</v>

5403
02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:55.300
<v Speaker 3>People walking on the street with beers in their hands right by cops and the</v>

5404
02:18:55.301 --> 02:18:56.740
<v Speaker 3>cops are talking to them and everybody's,</v>

5405
02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:57.970
<v Speaker 3>everybody's friendly.</v>

5406
02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Such a good vibe.</v>

5407
02:19:01.670 --> 02:19:02.503
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

5408
02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:04.240
<v Speaker 3>special in New Orleans,</v>

5409
02:19:04.241 --> 02:19:05.290
<v Speaker 3>but I can time it right,</v>

5410
02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:06.340
<v Speaker 3>like timing sucked.</v>

5411
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:07.281
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

5412
02:19:07.281 --> 02:19:08.380
<v Speaker 3>that place is amazing.</v>

5413
02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Friendly and fun.</v>

5414
02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:10.931
<v Speaker 3>And I did a show there.</v>

5415
02:19:10.931 --> 02:19:11.800
<v Speaker 3>I did the House of Blues.</v>

5416
02:19:11.801 --> 02:19:13.450
<v Speaker 3>There was one of my favorite all time.</v>

5417
02:19:15.450 --> 02:19:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5418
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:19.000
<v Speaker 3>we went to and then we watched some burlesque.</v>

5419
02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:19.630
<v Speaker 3>What a,</v>

5420
02:19:19.630 --> 02:19:21.010
<v Speaker 3>what a hustle that is.</v>

5421
02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:22.960
<v Speaker 3>What a nonsense hustle.</v>

5422
02:19:22.961 --> 02:19:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Those burlesque shows are.</v>

5423
02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Well one of them of them,</v>

5424
02:19:27.681 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>

5425
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:28.880
<v Speaker 7>really weird.</v>

5426
02:19:28.881 --> 02:19:31.550
<v Speaker 7>Like there was a guy like a carnival barker dude comes on,</v>

5427
02:19:31.551 --> 02:19:34.670
<v Speaker 7>he's got a big handlebar mustache and he's dressed kind of crazy.</v>

5428
02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.050
<v Speaker 7>Like he's from another time,</v>

5429
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:40.190
<v Speaker 7>there was a couple people that actually had a pretty dope act and one of them,</v>

5430
02:19:40.191 --> 02:19:44.330
<v Speaker 7>there was a guy and a girl and they had like little Hula hoops and um,</v>

5431
02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:44.621
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

5432
02:19:44.621 --> 02:19:45.291
<v Speaker 7>the guy would,</v>

5433
02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:45.500
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5434
02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:46.680
<v Speaker 7>throw the girl up in the end,</v>

5435
02:19:46.710 --> 02:19:48.390
<v Speaker 7>she would land on her shoulders that she would have.</v>

5436
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.920
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>

5437
02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.720
<v Speaker 7>it was really a great act.</v>

5438
02:19:50.721 --> 02:19:53.870
<v Speaker 7>And they were like Hula Hoop and together while the girl was on top and the guy</v>

5439
02:19:53.871 --> 02:19:55.100
<v Speaker 7>was like holding her up with his hands.</v>

5440
02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:55.530
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>

5441
02:19:55.530 --> 02:19:57.560
<v Speaker 7>they knew what the fuck they would do and they had planned it out.</v>

5442
02:19:57.570 --> 02:19:57.720
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5443
02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:02.720
<v Speaker 7>And then the next one was literally an overweight woman who dances and the guy</v>

5444
02:20:03.081 --> 02:20:06.620
<v Speaker 7>introduces her saying that beautiful things come at all,</v>

5445
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:08.600
<v Speaker 7>literally said this.</v>

5446
02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:10.220
<v Speaker 7>She like really David.</v>

5447
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 7>And she wasn't obese.</v>

5448
02:20:12.441 --> 02:20:14.770
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't like disgusting where he had a warrant.</v>

5449
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.340
<v Speaker 7>Ours is not hiring her.</v>

5450
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.641
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

5451
02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:17.750
<v Speaker 7>no scores is not hiring.</v>

5452
02:20:17.770 --> 02:20:17.901
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

5453
02:20:17.901 --> 02:20:21.200
<v Speaker 7>And so she gets up there and she's got this bright smile on her face and it's</v>

5454
02:20:21.201 --> 02:20:21.620
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

5455
02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:24.620
<v Speaker 7>it's like this weird thing that everyone's dressed from like a period piece,</v>

5456
02:20:24.621 --> 02:20:27.140
<v Speaker 7>but essentially all she did was stand there and dance.</v>

5457
02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 7>So it was the emperor's new clothes.</v>

5458
02:20:29.930 --> 02:20:31.910
<v Speaker 7>She took a little bit of the clothes off at the end.</v>

5459
02:20:31.911 --> 02:20:34.880
<v Speaker 7>She was kind of in like sort of a bikini type of thing and then she got off and</v>

5562
02:22:57.930 --> 02:22:59.580
<v Speaker 5>So the other stuff was just like filler.</v>

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:00.251
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5564
02:23:00.251 --> 02:23:02.100
<v Speaker 5>Filler between people having sex.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

5566
02:23:02.610 --> 02:23:03.750

<v Speaker 5>Like they were funny with each other and they were like,</v>

5570
02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:08.220
<v Speaker 5>she's back from her tour of the,</v>

5571
02:23:08.221 --> 02:23:08.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5572
02:23:08.491 --> 02:23:09.210
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

5573
02:23:09.210 --> 02:23:10.710
<v Speaker 5>it was all kind of like ironic,</v>

5574
02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 5>but there was not a second of anything sensual or exciting.</v>

5575
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:16.080
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

5576
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:16.890
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

5577
02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:18.240
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they do that on purpose.</v>

5578
02:23:18.241 --> 02:23:18.841
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody,</v>

5580
02:23:21.061 --> 02:23:22.040

5581
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:23.600
<v Speaker 7>maybe that's probably exactly what they're doing.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
