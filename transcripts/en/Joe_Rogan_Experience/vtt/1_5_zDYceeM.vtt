00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>It just looks difficult.</v>

14
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.610

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

17
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>the fighter in the cage.</v>

19
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So a professor rather in the cage.</v>

20
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I got your book right here and I was fascinated when I heard the concept and,</v>

21
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>even more fascinated to talk to you about this.</v>

23
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>You decided to write a book about taking up mixed martial arts and competing.</v>

24
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

26
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>what caused this,</v>

27
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>this bug?</v>

28
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I was working as a English instructor at a small Liberal Arts college and</v>

30
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>western Pennsylvania,</v>

31
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>just outside of Pittsburgh.</v>

32
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And I was pushing up on middle age.</v>

33
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

34
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I think I was 38 and a half at the time.</v>

35
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

36
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.713
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

37
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I did that.</v>

38
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like five year old,</v>

39
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I did the little kids in my house be,</v>

41
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>that's why I do.</v>

42
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>so I was 38 and a half at the time and I was sort of,</v>

44
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

45
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>as career wasn't going that well.</v>

46
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I had never made an under the tenure track and it looked like I was never going</v>

47
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

48
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>So I sort of needed something new in life.</v>

49
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And one day I'm at my office hours and I happened to look out the front window</v>

50
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>and they used to be this auto part store across the street about as far away as</v>

51
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>a not gonna hit it with a snowball if I threw it.</v>

52
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And this new business had moved in and it was called Mark Schrader's Academy of</v>

53
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts.</v>

54
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And I said stood there at the window and I could see the guys in the cage see</v>

55
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.701
<v Speaker 1>seemed dancing,</v>

56
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:27.031
<v Speaker 1>hitting,</v>

57
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:27.541
<v Speaker 1>tackling,</v>

58
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:28.374
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>

59
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And I had this unexpected emotion and the emotion was envy.</v>

60
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I envied them.</v>

61
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>They seem so alive over there.</v>

62
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So courageous.</v>

63
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was sorta rotting away,</v>

64
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>in my life and my cubicle.</v>

66
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>and so I had this sort of funny thought into my head and his thought was this a</v>

68
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>joke at my own expense?</v>

69
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.594
<v Speaker 1>And the joke was,</v>

70
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be funny if I went across the street and join them?</v>

71
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>You know me cause I'm an,</v>

72
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I have this incredibly civilized job.</v>

73
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I've literally never been in a fight before.</v>

74
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost 40 and I'm very good shape.</v>

75
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

76
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thought was,</v>

77
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a book in that,</v>

80
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of nonfiction version of fight club.</v>

81
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I go across the street,</v>

82
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I tried to learn how to fight.</v>

83
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>And along the way though,</v>

84
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd be asking these sort of big,</v>

85
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:06.481
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

86
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>eternal questions about the role that violence has played in human life.</v>

87
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a difference between violence in terms of like people perceive</v>

88
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>violences Vic,</v>

89
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>there's being a victim.</v>

90
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

91
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's the violence that I think that everybody has a problem with what you</v>

92
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.570
<v Speaker 1>are engaging in his martial arts and the,</v>

93
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>although violent action happens in martial art overall,</v>

94
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>it sounds contradictory.</v>

95
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

96
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily about violence.</v>

97
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

98
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that's exactly right.</v>

99
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's exactly right.</v>

100
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And that was my journey.</v>

101
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

102
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>when I'm first looking at the cage from across the street,</v>

104
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at it with all the stereotypes that most outsiders have about the</v>

105
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:46.021
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>

106
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>And to me it looks really,</v>

107
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:47.694
<v Speaker 1>really violent.</v>

108
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.121
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I assume that the guys over there must be of a screw loose.</v>

110
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>They must be savages.</v>

111
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.763
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>and so I went over there to test a theory.</v>

113
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>The theory was,</v>

114
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.483
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

117
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>at the core of human nature and mixed martial arts is a perfect metaphor for it,</v>

118
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>for this violence at the heart of human nature.</v>

119
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I go over there and I find that my,</v>

120
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>my theory isn't very good.</v>

121
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>and what's happening over there?</v>

123
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:12.814
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>

124
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>It's often bloody and painful,</v>

125
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really quite even violence.</v>

126
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

127
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>because the emotions behind it are not angry.</v>

129
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Emotions are not,</v>

130
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>they're not the emotions of a,</v>

131
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>of violence or rage.</v>

132
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:27.500
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

134
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>the basic,</v>

135
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>competitive emotions.</v>

137
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's also in order to achieve a very high level,</v>

138
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you have to achieve something of a zen state.</v>

139
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And that Zen state can be fucked up by emotion.</v>

140
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It'd be tripped up.</v>

142
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Your training can be tripped up.</v>

143
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You decisions made under the duress of emotion,</v>

144
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>the worst decisions.</v>

145
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.471
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

146
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:47.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that,</v>

148
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Speaker 1>the instructor that the main instructor had gotten a mark Schrader warned.</v>

150
00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>That's about all the time simply because guys get mad,</v>

151
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>they get hit and they get mad.</v>

152
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like don't get mad.</v>

154
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>It ruins everything.</v>

155
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:57.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:57.341
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

157
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.121
<v Speaker 1>you make bad decisions.</v>

158
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>You also get tired,</v>

159
00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

160
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.763
<v Speaker 1>You have to get mad.</v>

161
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

162
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you also really get mad when you chase someone to try to get back half.</v>

163
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

164
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Then you have bad management of energy.</v>

165
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

166
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>there's so much involved in any sort of martial arts competition,</v>

167
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.981
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

168
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>any sort of martial arts training that you don't see unless you engage in it.</v>

169
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It was tremendously valuable to me to do this because at times I thought,</v>

172
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:23.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

173
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the first writer who had the idea to go and get,</v>

175
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>get in a fight and write about it.</v>

176
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:29.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>George Plimpton did it same.</v>

178
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Sheridan did and we've had shared it on your show.</v>

179
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a great book about it and a couple of other guys.</v>

180
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

181
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>so I wasn't the first to do it,</v>

182
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

183
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and so as a sort of publicity stunt,</v>

184
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>that's not really why I did it.</v>

185
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I did it because you really don't know anything about it unless you'd done it.</v>

186
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Unless you've gone over there and gotten into the cage and been sort of locked</v>

187
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.321
<v Speaker 1>up inside there,</v>

188
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>they literally fuck you up in there half naked,</v>

189
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and you're with this other guy and this other guy,</v>

191
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it's really scary.</v>

192
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

193
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>he's a savage killer and the only way he get out of that cage,</v>

194
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just somehow survive.</v>

195
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.460
<v Speaker 1>These next few minutes you're going to,</v>

196
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you're going to spend with this guy.</v>

197
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's an intensity to that thing that you know,</v>

198
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>is there when you watch it from the outside,</v>

199
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's much different to actually feel it,</v>

200
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>to feel what's actually happening to you,</v>

201
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>to feel what it's like to get punched in the face really hard.</v>

202
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

203
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it was a tremendously educational experience to actually do it.</v>

204
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Did it change the way?</v>

205
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Like did you watch martial arts before that or were you like really an outsider</v>

206
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:24.461
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

207
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

208
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>did you watch any UFC matches?</v>

209
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:26.471
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

210
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been a fan forever.</v>

211
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.593
<v Speaker 1>Forever.</v>

212
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

213
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.780
<v Speaker 1>but you still had like some preconceived notions when you saw the change?</v>

214
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to figure things out about it.</v>

216
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Like why do I watch this?</v>

217
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

218
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>because when I first started watching it,</v>

219
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I had a really good excuse.</v>

220
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I was in my early twenties,</v>

221
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:46.741
<v Speaker 1>it was about 1995 and I was a committed but basically an APP to karate student.</v>

222
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And the UFC was a tremendous education about what worked in a fight and what</v>

223
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>absolutely did not.</v>

224
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And most of the stuff that I was learning in my karate class is absolutely did</v>

225
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:00.314
<v Speaker 1>not work.</v>

226
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.303
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

227
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

228
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

229
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.510
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

230
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I was not new to the UFC was not new to cage fighting,</v>

231
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>but I had a very much of an outsider's perspective on it.</v>

232
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

233
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

234
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>and I was confused about what draws people to these kinds of spectacles.</v>

235
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>What draws people not only to compete in the cage.</v>

236
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting question,</v>

237
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>but also what draws people to watch combat sports or watch other forms of</v>

238
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>violence back to call people who are decent,</v>

239
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>civilized human beings.</v>

240
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Why do we want to watch this stuff now?</v>

241
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>When you were practicing karate,</v>

242
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 1>like how long did you practice for?</v>

243
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

244
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe like two years.</v>

245
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And I gave it up because of the USC.</v>

246
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I gave it up because of the UFC.</v>

247
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:36.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

248
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>we missed the boat when Machida came along,</v>

249
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden people started practicing karate again.</v>

250
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

251
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

252
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

253
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.951
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

254
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:43.784
<v Speaker 1>I love the chair.</v>

255
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

256
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 1>As long as you,</v>

257
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.623
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's,</v>

258
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're mixing it into a system rather than sticking with coke Oshan</v>

259
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.861
<v Speaker 1>karate,</v>

260
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.694
<v Speaker 1>which is what I had.</v>

261
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.251
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

262
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>and so my school was very purist and when I said,</v>

263
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>when did my sensai and said,</v>

264
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.311
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

265
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:58.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.250
<v Speaker 1>since a,</v>

267
00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>in a very careful,</v>

269
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

271
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>there's authority in these dough Joe's,</v>

272
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>there's tradition that you question at your peril.</v>

273
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

274
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.611
<v Speaker 1>and so I went in and said,</v>

275
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:07.761
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

276
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:07.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:08.541
<v Speaker 1>since they bill,</v>

278
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

280
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching these tapes.</v>

281
00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>So washing my blockbuster blockbuster tapes of these UFC fights.</v>

282
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And long story short is guys like us.</v>

283
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>They're not just losing,</v>

284
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>they're getting slaughtered,</v>

285
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>they're getting massacred.</v>

286
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

287
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>they get a couple of feeble punches off.</v>

288
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>They get tackled to the ground,</v>

289
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>beaten half to death.</v>

290
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.021
<v Speaker 1>And so I say to him,</v>

291
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.043
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

293
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you're taking down in a fight?</v>

294
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:30.884
<v Speaker 1>And He'd be like,</v>

295
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>you look at me and be,</v>

296
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.201
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious.</v>

297
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

298
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>just don't get taken down.</v>

299
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.060
<v Speaker 1>It's that easy.</v>

300
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

301
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

302
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.741
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

303
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>and right then it hit me that he didn't know anything about fighting.</v>

304
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know how often fights go to the ground.</v>

305
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know that not getting taken down is a martial art.</v>

306
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.381
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

307
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

308
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't know that.</v>

309
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

310
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're not training for that,</v>

311
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're not drilling it,</v>

312
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get taken down.</v>

313
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't drilled ways to stand back up again,</v>

314
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to stay down.</v>

315
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

316
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So what I realized then that that was,</v>

317
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.651
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

318
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:00.981
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

319
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:01.814
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

320
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>we were like larpers live action role playing,</v>

321
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

322
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

323
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Larping is no,</v>

324
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but I do now it's live d and d you go off into the woods with your friends and</v>

325
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>you play d and d live.</v>

326
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:13.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

327
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty awesome.</v>

328
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.661
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

329
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.351
<v Speaker 1>But that's what we were doing.</v>

330
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:15.831
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

331
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>We are larping as,</v>

332
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.211
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

333
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.044
<v Speaker 1>Samurai.</v>

334
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

335
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.731
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

336
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.630
<v Speaker 1>so after that was pretty disillusioned and I,</v>

337
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.513
<v Speaker 1>and I gave it up.</v>

338
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I would've gone into it earlier,</v>

339
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:29.111
<v Speaker 1>but it took a long time for MMA and Bjj to make it to my neck of the woods.</v>

340
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It's been out here in La and in New York City for a long time,</v>

341
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but I've always kind of lived in podunk towns and it's only in,</v>

342
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:35.781
<v Speaker 1>it's only,</v>

343
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

344
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.140
<v Speaker 1>not until 2010 or 2011 that I had the option to do this where I really,</v>

345
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

346
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu until 2010 or 11.</v>

347
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.740
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

348
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>You're still the same place outside of Pittsburgh?</v>

349
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 1>How far is Pittsburgh?</v>

351
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Pittsburgh is about a half hour,</v>

352
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 1>but even Pittsburgh,</v>

353
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Pittsburgh had one BJJ school it,</v>

354
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>but that was all,</v>

355
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't,</v>

357
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.481
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't,</v>

358
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't.</v>

359
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>There was a fight club that had gone out of business and him may club that had</v>

360
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.104
<v Speaker 2>gone out of business.</v>

361
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 2>They get their back now and it ends up grace.</v>

362
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 2>He has a school there now.</v>

363
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>So there is good stuff there now,</v>

364
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's very difficult to make money teaching MMA very difficult.</v>

365
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 2>You can do much better teaching Jujitsu or teaching taekwondo.</v>

366
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Even our karate.</v>

367
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.233
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

368
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

369
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I had a similar um,</v>

370
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 2>martial arts upbringing.</v>

371
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

372
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I started out in taekwondo but dedicated my entire life to it.</v>

373
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>And then when I started kickboxing,</v>

374
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 2>that was my eye opening.</v>

375
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 2>It was before even grappling,</v>

376
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 2>grappling them as my second eye opening.</v>

377
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 2>My first eye opening was kickboxing because I realize and then also just</v>

378
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>training straight boxing rules that help terrible my hands were cause taekwondo</v>

379
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>was so kicked the trivia.</v>

380
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>It was just all about kicking.</v>

382
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 2>And when guys are only kicking you,</v>

383
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things you can get away with that you can't get away with when</v>

384
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:47.154
<v Speaker 2>they're punching you.</v>

385
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>And I had this like big enlightenment moment like,</v>

386
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:50.281
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

387
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I've been wasting my time and not really,</v>

388
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:56.440
<v Speaker 2>it turned down in the long run cause I learned a lot of things and I,</v>

389
00:09:56.441 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I developed dexterity that it's very unusual.</v>

390
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 2>It's deck.</v>

391
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:00.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

392
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:01.051
<v Speaker 2>Flexibility.</v>

393
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 2>But anybody could develop flexibility is the dexterity is unusual.</v>

394
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Like the ability to throw kicks in positions in ways that a lot of other people</v>

395
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

396
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's just because that's all you do.</v>

397
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 2>You're throwing a lot of kicks.</v>

398
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

399
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot of guys that took that style.</v>

400
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Like Anderson Silva is one of them and started out as a taekwondo guy and then</v>

401
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.220
<v Speaker 2>eventually developed all the martial arts skills.</v>

402
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Take down defense wrestling and Jujitsu and whatnot.</v>

403
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

404
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>when the UFC came around,</v>

405
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 2>most people who are on the outside,</v>

406
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

407
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 2>they'll look at it like,</v>

408
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:30.991
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

409
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I've had so many people say like,</v>

410
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 2>that's not martial arts,</v>

411
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a sports martial sport and there's all this silliness attached to it.</v>

412
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 2>But what they need to know is that no one knew when I was a kid.</v>

413
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 2>No one knew until 93 no one knew.</v>

414
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know that it was so easy to take you down.</v>

415
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:49.190
<v Speaker 2>And when they did take you down,</v>

416
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 2>he would just break your arm.</v>

417
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just strangle you and sat and it's like no one had any idea how</v>

418
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:54.190
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable they were.</v>

419
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I know it's,</v>

420
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 2>it was a shock,</v>

421
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.241
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it in shock.</v>

423
00:10:57.241 --> 00:10:57.931
<v Speaker 2>Total shock.</v>

424
00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:58.590
<v Speaker 2>And I watch,</v>

425
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

426
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing the first couple of them and I watched them religiously.</v>

427
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.101
<v Speaker 2>At first I'd,</v>

428
00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:03.331
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

429
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:03.991
<v Speaker 2>I'd pause,</v>

430
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:04.681
<v Speaker 2>I'd slowed down,</v>

431
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I rewind and watch the movie.</v>

432
00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:06.874
<v Speaker 2>We tried to etch it,</v>

433
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 2>into my memory banks.</v>

435
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.130
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

436
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

437
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

438
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I watched with a sinking feeling like,</v>

439
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.413
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

440
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 2>this is not at all.</v>

441
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.683
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

442
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I started you Jitsu almost immediately after discovering it.</v>

443
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I found out about it in 94 or five I think I found it.</v>

444
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 2>It started out in 93 and I think I came out to La in [inaudible] 94 and</v>

445
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in mid 94 I've found out about the UFC and I didn't see the first one.</v>

446
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I saw like the second one and I watched it on video.</v>

447
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did too.</v>

448
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

449
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 2>like a VHS tape video.</v>

450
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.401
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

451
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:38.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

452
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I used to hang out in that section of video store.</v>

453
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:41.064
<v Speaker 2>I still remember it.</v>

454
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.791
<v Speaker 2>I would learn it.</v>

455
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:42.561
<v Speaker 2>They're dangerous.</v>

456
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:46.340
<v Speaker 2>He like like little to large lobby lurking there like like you know when you're</v>

457
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 2>in the porno section or something because it was like,</v>

458
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 2>it was like UFC video with WWF,</v>

459
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.220
<v Speaker 2>a death faces.</v>

460
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Death</v>

461
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 3>was in that section.</v>

462
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 3>There were all lumped in together.</v>

463
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was with.</v>

464
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

465
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:58.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

466
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was training at the jet center,</v>

467
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 3>which is a famous kickboxing gym and Van Eyes.</v>

468
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>It was right before it went under because they'd gotten damaged in the</v>

469
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.631
<v Speaker 3>earthquake.</v>

470
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 3>And then once a rain came after the earthquake,</v>

471
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 3>they got massive flood damage and they eventually went under.</v>

472
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 3>But before they went under,</v>

473
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 3>that was where when I first moved to California,</v>

474
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 3>I started working out and Benny the jet or key does is like one of the pioneers</v>

475
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.920
<v Speaker 3>of not just kickboxing but incorporating low kicks and fighting against the ties</v>

476
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 3>and the Japanese with their low kicks and then fighting in like sort of no holds</v>

477
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:30.761
<v Speaker 3>barred.</v>

478
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Tournament's back then.</v>

479
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.140
<v Speaker 3>And Benny had this,</v>

480
00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

481
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:34.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

482
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:34.910
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>

483
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

484
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

485
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.020
<v Speaker 3>his brother in law,</v>

486
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I guess blinky Rodriguez is a famous kickboxers well would teach classes there.</v>

487
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.260
<v Speaker 3>And who's a crazy environment cause he a blinky had some family tragedy</v>

488
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 3>involving gang violence.</v>

489
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 3>So he had a lot of gang members that would a train there and work out there.</v>

490
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:53.911
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

491
00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 3>like you'd have these guys,</v>

492
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 3>like I remember this one guy had this really shitty like prison tattoo on his</v>

493
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 3>back that said like whatever gang member was like,</v>

494
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 3>love block does.</v>

495
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 3>And then underneath it it said fuck the rest,</v>

496
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 3>like tattooed big on his back,</v>

497
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 3>like a 12 year old drew it in there and I was like,</v>

498
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:10.271
<v Speaker 3>oh Christ.</v>

499
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Like this is where I'm working out.</v>

500
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

501
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

502
00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:14.010
<v Speaker 3>when we take classes,</v>

503
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 3>those guys and spar with those guys,</v>

504
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 3>it was just very disconcerting.</v>

505
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you didn't want to beat up a gang member and they get shot in the parking</v>

506
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:20.250
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

507
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 3>but the um,</v>

508
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:21.860
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

509
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 3>the place was abuzz about these tapes.</v>

510
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Like people had found out about him.</v>

511
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.161

<v Speaker 3>you see this shit,</v>

513
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.751
<v Speaker 3>but it's like damn,</v>

514
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker just grabs people and drag them to the ground,</v>

515
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:32.870
<v Speaker 3>chokes him and everybody wanted to talk about it and it was just,</v>

516
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 3>it was just no sense.</v>

517
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 3>It didn't,</v>

518
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.820
<v Speaker 3>not only didn't make any sense,</v>

519
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.341
<v Speaker 3>everybody was like,</v>

520
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:37.174
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing here?</v>

521
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:37.440
<v Speaker 3>What do,</v>

522
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:37.600

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 3>what do we doing with our skillset?</v>

524
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:39.911
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

525
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:40.870

526
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Like what if we want to do one of those dudes?</v>

527
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And so I went to a cross and Gracie's,</v>

528
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 3>which was a [inaudible] know about it.</v>

529
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I found out about the gym from,</v>

530
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 3>there was a show called,</v>

531
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called extreme fighting championships.</v>

532
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 3>There was a very small at John Perretti was the,</v>

533
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 3>the the matchmaker and he was producing it think it's called extreme combat</v>

534
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.600
<v Speaker 3>stream something stream.</v>

535
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember a lot of extreme uh,</v>

536
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.053
<v Speaker 3>promotions.</v>

537
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

538
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.291
<v Speaker 3>But they had a,</v>

539
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 3>a montage,</v>

540
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.470
<v Speaker 3>like a training montage thing for one of the fighters and uh,</v>

541
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 3>he was training at Carlson Gracie's and I knew that Mario Sperry train there and</v>

542
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:18.761
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

543
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 3>one of the big guys at the time and Marillo Bustamonte was Dan Vitor Belfort was</v>

544
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 3>there before he made his UFC debut.</v>

545
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 3>I came in there right when he was making his debut.</v>

546
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:28.414
<v Speaker 3>He had just,</v>

547
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I got there when he was about to fight John Hess in Hawaii and he fought Ho John</v>

548
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 3>has in Hawaii who had fought in the UFC and beat the fuck out of them in about</v>

549
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 3>10 seconds.</v>

550
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of the craziest fights ever.</v>

551
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 3>He got on top of them and just,</v>

552
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I think he went and needed a belly on him and just uncorked about 50 punches to</v>

553
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:46.721
<v Speaker 3>his face.</v>

554
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody had seen anybody like Vittorio was a horrible monster.</v>

555
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>He's still fighting fucking weekend,</v>

556
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.060

557
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Vito is fighting this weekend for the title.</v>

558
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Madness.</v>

560
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.513
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

561
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.620
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

562
00:14:59.620 --> 00:14:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

563
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I just was in the,</v>

564
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.370
<v Speaker 2>is immediately upon going to Carlson Gracie's I was just manhandled and thrown</v>

565
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.660
<v Speaker 2>around like a little baby and strangled left and right.</v>

566
00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:10.951
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

567
00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:11.571
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

568
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking helpless.</v>

569
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I had this delusional idea that I could,</v>

570
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I could defend myself,</v>

571
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 2>but as a white belt in Jujitsu,</v>

572
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 2>even with a year of high school wrestling,</v>

573
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like knew how to wrestle a little.</v>

574
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I knew how to like get on top of guy and then I get triangled their farm,</v>

575
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:29.040
<v Speaker 2>barter guillotined and they'd take my back and you know,</v>

577
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 2>the gay was ridiculous,</v>

578
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

579
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.610
<v Speaker 2>wrapping me up in that thing and just,</v>

580
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>

581
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 2>It was so humiliating.</v>

582
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

583
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget it,</v>

584
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 2>but also so enlightening.</v>

585
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.950
<v Speaker 2>And for you going from this karate background to then entering into mixed</v>

586
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 2>martial arts training,</v>

587
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 2>like what was,</v>

588
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 2>why I'd never been punched in the face for one thing.</v>

589
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 2>It all your karate training.</v>

590
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.070
<v Speaker 2>No one punched you in the face.</v>

591
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 2>We always threw punches to the chest because it's Kyokushin.</v>

592
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.493
<v Speaker 2>Kio Yeah.</v>

593
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

594
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:03.501
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

595
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:04.161
<v Speaker 2>So you never,</v>

596
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 2>you never,</v>

597
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's boxing gloves on and fucked around.</v>

598
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we did,</v>

599
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 2>but not for real.</v>

600
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:08.864
<v Speaker 2>I mean the level,</v>

601
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.041
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

602
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

603
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the intensity of sparring at the [inaudible] was so much more intense.</v>

604
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we put boxing gloves on and,</v>

605
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:15.541
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

606
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 2>and threw some punches,</v>

607
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 2>but very soft.</v>

608
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

609
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>

610
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 2>there's days that the MMA gym where it's a very,</v>

611
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 2>very close to being,</v>

612
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 2>a real fight in there,</v>

614
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.790
<v Speaker 2>not fin is a real fun.</v>

615
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty close to being in a real fight.</v>

616
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

617
00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:29.061
<v Speaker 2>It's painful.</v>

618
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Ask as in,</v>

619
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

620
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

621
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the Daniel Cormier who is also fighting this weekend,</v>

622
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

623
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.271
<v Speaker 2>Courtney said,</v>

624
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 2>sometimes mean Keynes bar and sometimes we fight.</v>

625
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

626
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 2>He said that in the old days we fought,</v>

627
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.853
<v Speaker 2>we always fought.</v>

628
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Now sometimes he's bar.</v>

629
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.963
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

630
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 2>that's a big concern today.</v>

631
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 2>The big concern is like how much do you take out of yourself in the gym is how</v>

632
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

633
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.520
<v Speaker 2>how much is it necessary though?</v>

634
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Like in order to prepare to be comfortable in the cage and to fight at your</v>

635
00:16:58.791 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

636
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 2>how much do you have to take out of your system?</v>

637
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

638
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 2>it is a tough decision because if they go the go easy,</v>

639
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:05.980
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid that their guys go,</v>

640
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm really horrible at the time.</v>

641
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 2>I think go hard.</v>

642
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:08.770
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

643
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

644
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.451
<v Speaker 2>what does it,</v>

645
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it's practically a coin flip,</v>

646
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:13.580
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to get through to the fight without getting injured in some</v>

647
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:14.150
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

648
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.983
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

649
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 2>one of the best gyms,</v>

650
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

651
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 2>American Kickboxing Academy,</v>

652
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:19.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

653
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.271
<v Speaker 2>Dana White,</v>

654
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>it was just talking about how they train,</v>

655
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 2>like cavemen,</v>

656
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>like to get,</v>

657
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 2>get out of stone age.</v>

658
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.840
<v Speaker 2>And they kind of said,</v>

659
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:27.111
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

660
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:27.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 2>you kind of don't realize what's necessary to prepare for fights,</v>

662
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>but then you look at the amount of guys that get hurt there.</v>

663
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

664
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>it is pretty crazy.</v>

665
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

666
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.940
<v Speaker 2>but you look at the amount of guys that have really good there.</v>

667
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Luke Rockhold,</v>

668
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:39.641
<v Speaker 2>Daniel core,</v>

669
00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:42.020
<v Speaker 2>me a Cain Velasquez like fuck.</v>

670
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 2>You can't argue with that success.</v>

671
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me like there is no easy way out of this.</v>

672
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.721
<v Speaker 2>Does no,</v>

673
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can train light.</v>

674
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 2>The problem</v>

675
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.220
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

676
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

677
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.500
<v Speaker 1>other sports would have this problems that they have.</v>

678
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.580
<v Speaker 1>They have an authority that governs it and makes everyone behave the same way.</v>

679
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So the NFL,</v>

680
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.841
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

681
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:01.561
<v Speaker 1>for the NCAA,</v>

682
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>like football teams for instance,</v>

683
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 1>there are allowed to practice so many hours a week and that's it.</v>

684
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

685
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.071
<v Speaker 1>It's by a rule,</v>

687
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:08.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:09.084
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed that you put,</v>

689
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you put you in your 20 or 30 hours a week and then that's it.</v>

690
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to train on your own.</v>

691
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.121
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

692
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:14.954
<v Speaker 1>Because he could.</v>

693
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.511
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

694
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 1>You guys will cheat and go.</v>

695
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a problem with fighting.</v>

697
00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Fighting is a team sport.</v>

698
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

699
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.651
<v Speaker 3>no findings.</v>

700
00:18:20.651 --> 00:18:23.710
<v Speaker 3>An individual's right to anytime anybody goes well,</v>

701
00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:24.610
<v Speaker 3>the people in the NFL,</v>

702
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:25.570
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

703
00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.403
<v Speaker 3>the NFL,</v>

704
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.710
<v Speaker 3>first of all that fucking whistle blows and you get a nice juicy break.</v>

705
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

706
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean now you get to catch your breath,</v>

707
00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 3>walk around offsides you got that guy talks timeout.</v>

708
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 3>He says a bunch of shit that went wrong and everybody complains and it's a joke.</v>

709
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.180
<v Speaker 3>If you compare the amount of effort you have to put forth and an NFL,</v>

710
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.370
<v Speaker 3>sure the collisions are horrific.</v>

711
00:18:45.371 --> 00:18:46.021
<v Speaker 3>Shore you.</v>

712
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:48.580
<v Speaker 3>You mean you got to work out hard to be that fucking big and strong.</v>

713
00:18:48.581 --> 00:18:49.480
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>

714
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.750
<v Speaker 3>But as for like the life and death experience of being in the cage,</v>

715
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.430
<v Speaker 3>fuck</v>

716
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

717
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

718
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

719
00:18:58.181 --> 00:18:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I think comparison is nothing.</v>

720
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.723
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

721
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Now how did you,</v>

722
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.750
<v Speaker 1>did you start off with the beginner classes?</v>

723
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you,</v>

724
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.150
<v Speaker 1>how did you enter into this?</v>

725
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

726
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically this gym,</v>

727
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:10.954
<v Speaker 1>it's a small gym,</v>

728
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a small town.</v>

730
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.000
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

731
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.700
<v Speaker 1>how many students were,</v>

732
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.440
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

733
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.220
<v Speaker 1>it would vary,</v>

734
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:19:15.491 --> 00:19:15.641
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

736
00:19:15.641 --> 00:19:16.221
<v Speaker 1>it's like you said,</v>

737
00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:19.060
<v Speaker 1>and it is a tough business and MMA gym with a tough business.</v>

738
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And so it might be booming in popularity as a spectator sport.</v>

739
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean most guys want to get in there and start training.</v>

740
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:25.901
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

741
00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

742
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.370
<v Speaker 1>cause it doesn't look like all that much fun opening up a base jumping school.</v>

743
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

744
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:31.721
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

745
00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

746
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

747
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.951
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

748
00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:33.700
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

749
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

750
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I think he expected as a lot of guys who opened those gyms to that,</v>

751
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:39.850
<v Speaker 1>that the level of popularity as a spectator sport,</v>

752
00:19:39.851 --> 00:19:43.330
<v Speaker 1>it would track with the level of a participate participation.</v>

753
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

754
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.540
<v Speaker 1>so maybe like most nights to be 15 guys there,</v>

755
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.523
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

756
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad.</v>

757
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.181
<v Speaker 1>That's not too bad.</v>

758
00:19:49.181 --> 00:19:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever have an issue with the guys who were more experienced beating up on</v>

760
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:54.260
<v Speaker 3>the guys who so</v>

761
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:54.980
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>

762
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

763
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.060
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

764
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.631
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

765
00:19:56.631 --> 00:19:57.231
<v Speaker 1>but honestly,</v>

766
00:19:57.231 --> 00:19:58.064
<v Speaker 1>not for the most part.</v>

767
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

768
00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:58.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:02.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a very clear pecking order emerges in an intimate jam or any kind of</v>

770
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:05.810
<v Speaker 1>martial arts gym almost from day one.</v>

771
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And people have a very good sense of very,</v>

772
00:20:08.121 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 1>very good sense of who would kick his ass if it came down to a real fight.</v>

773
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

774
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.730
<v Speaker 1>and so for the most part,</v>

775
00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the big guys don't bully or oppress the little guys.</v>

776
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.600
<v Speaker 1>It was no glory in it.</v>

777
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.160
<v Speaker 1>And the little guys also know not to antagonize the big guys,</v>

778
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:20:22.881 --> 00:20:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they give them respect,</v>

780
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.170
<v Speaker 1>they give them submissive body language.</v>

781
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

782
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:28.520
<v Speaker 1>one time I was going to fight,</v>

783
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:28.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

784
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.330
<v Speaker 1>or spar this big heavyweight in my channel and we often had this part of our</v>

785
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:33.980
<v Speaker 1>weight class because it is a smaller gym.</v>

786
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.870
<v Speaker 1>So this guy weighs like 270 pounds.</v>

787
00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:37.940
<v Speaker 1>He's a competition fight or I'm terrified.</v>

788
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:38.571
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

789
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.100
<v Speaker 1>and in the moment before the bell rings,</v>

790
00:20:40.101 --> 00:20:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I go right up to him and I hug him,</v>

791
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.170
<v Speaker 1>bury my head right in his fragrant,</v>

792
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.460
<v Speaker 1>meaty cleavage.</v>

793
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.213
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

794
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>come on Clark,</v>

795
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I got a family.</v>

796
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

797
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm after that,</v>

798
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

799
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 1>you didn't exactly go easy on me,</v>

800
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but he let me live.</v>

801
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 1>So and that happens,</v>

802
00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty explicit about it,</v>

804
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 1>but I think that kind of language,</v>

805
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that kind of communication is going on a lot at the gym.</v>

806
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

807
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.300
<v Speaker 3>it certainly is.</v>

808
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It does in Jujitsu as well.</v>

809
00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll see some guys that like as the rolling,</v>

810
00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:12.540
<v Speaker 3>they're just more submissive to other guys.</v>

811
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

812
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.300
<v Speaker 3>like when someone is more dominant,</v>

813
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 3>it's like you,</v>

814
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 3>there's just certain things you don't even try.</v>

815
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll automatically go in defensive mode,</v>

816
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.200
<v Speaker 3>which is also very dangerous for the guy who's the best guy in the gym because</v>

817
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you can get a very inflated sense of your abilities if you're always,</v>

818
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's certain finders that fought in lower level organizations and</v>

819
00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:37.230
<v Speaker 3>then came over to the UFC and as they came over to the UFC,</v>

820
00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:40.650
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things that was clear was that they had never faced another</v>

821
00:21:40.651 --> 00:21:41.150
<v Speaker 3>killer.</v>

822
00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Like they might be a killer themselves.</v>

824
00:21:42.981 --> 00:21:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

825
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.010
<v Speaker 3>But they had never faced another killer and then wouldn't face a killer in the</v>

826
00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:47.491
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>

827
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:47.850
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>

828
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.421
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

829
00:21:48.421 --> 00:21:50.490
<v Speaker 3>this is what it's like to fight me this song.</v>

830
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:51.890
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

831
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.920
<v Speaker 3>you would often find out who's got it and who doesn't have it.</v>

832
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

833
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.771
<v Speaker 1>I might tell him.</v>

834
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely true.</v>

835
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:21:58.091 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 1>They call them the better guys there.</v>

837
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't hit those guys harder than face.</v>

838
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:01.751
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

839
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:02.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

840
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to,</v>

841
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.410
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

842
00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Even you authorize them to hit you hard.</v>

843
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

844
00:22:06.171 --> 00:22:06.620
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>

845
00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll be Carlos Condit said that once he did this,</v>

846
00:22:09.291 --> 00:22:10.124
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

847
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.371
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

848
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:11.300
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>

849
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:11.631
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

850
00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:15.320
<v Speaker 3>for the military and did this some sparring and stuff with some of the military</v>

851
00:22:15.321 --> 00:22:16.670
<v Speaker 3>guys and he's real clear.</v>

852
00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:16.881
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

853
00:22:16.881 --> 00:22:17.540
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

854
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.080
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

855
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.190
<v Speaker 3>we can have some fun here.</v>

856
00:22:19.191 --> 00:22:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Just hit me as hard as you want to get hit.</v>

857
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.983
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

858
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.930
<v Speaker 3>When you're that good.</v>

859
00:22:23.931 --> 00:22:24.381
<v Speaker 3>And you could say,</v>

860
00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:25.940
<v Speaker 3>just hit me as hard as you want to get it.</v>

861
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Don't hit that guy hard.</v>

862
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.573
<v Speaker 3>Trust me.</v>

863
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.153
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

864
00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:31.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

865
00:22:31.881 --> 00:22:32.180
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

866
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.580
<v Speaker 3>it's finding that perfect balance of,</v>

867
00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:35.840
<v Speaker 3>of competition,</v>

868
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.520
<v Speaker 3>but have also,</v>

869
00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

870
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.500
<v Speaker 3>like you got to figure out how to not kill each other inside the gym.</v>

871
00:22:42.501 --> 00:22:44.750
<v Speaker 3>You gotta compete and push each other.</v>

872
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 3>And oftentimes it's just a matter of just pulling back on shots of not trying to</v>

873
00:22:49.971 --> 00:22:53.270
<v Speaker 3>knock each other out because the guys who tried to knock each other out,</v>

874
00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:53.540
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

875
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.380
<v Speaker 3>that fucking,</v>

876
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.740
<v Speaker 3>that style of sparring that just cannot,</v>

877
00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.090
<v Speaker 3>cannot maintain.</v>

878
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

879
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really dominant.</v>

880
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 1>There are guys in my gym like that guys who apparently can't pull the punch</v>

881
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 1>either by either by lack of athleticism.</v>

882
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.471
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

883
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a hard thing to throw the punch as hard as you can do there are for</v>

884
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that and then pull it at the very last second.</v>

885
00:23:13.241 --> 00:23:16.560
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of an athletic thing to be able to pull off and,</v>

886
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and I would hate hate is partnering with those guys.</v>

887
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:19.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

888
00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:20.910
<v Speaker 3>there's always a guy like that.</v>

889
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.690
<v Speaker 3>There's guys like that in Jujitsu to that guys would never spar with.</v>

890
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:25.711
<v Speaker 3>There was this one,</v>

891
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.460
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

892
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.780
<v Speaker 3>no need to name names,</v>

893
00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:29.310
<v Speaker 3>but at a John Jacques Machado is,</v>

894
00:23:29.311 --> 00:23:32.160
<v Speaker 3>we'd all just get away from this guy because if you sparred with him,</v>

895
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:33.240
<v Speaker 3>if he caught you in anything,</v>

896
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:35.460
<v Speaker 3>he's going to fuck your arm up fucking neck up.</v>

897
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Like he just would not let go and he didn't know how to not yank on things.</v>

898
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.920
<v Speaker 3>And then there's other guys that were way better than him that you never worried</v>

899
00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:44.221
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

900
00:23:44.221 --> 00:23:45.054
<v Speaker 3>Like you might get,</v>

901
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.440
<v Speaker 3>you might get tapped like,</v>

902
00:23:46.441 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

903
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 3>like if you roll with John Jacques Machado,</v>

904
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 3>even if you get tapped,</v>

905
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.650
<v Speaker 3>it's so controlled.</v>

906
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:51.861
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

907
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you never get hurt,</v>

908
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

909
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 3>like he'll be wraps you up in a triangle or takes your back or something like</v>

910
00:23:56.661 --> 00:23:57.021
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

911
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Like he's in control the entire time.</v>

912
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 3>There's no yanking or weird shit twisting that you didn't expect.</v>

913
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 3>And those are like the dangerous guys,</v>

914
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 3>like the really strong blue belts.</v>

915
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

916
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.820
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

917
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.300
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

918
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Those are the guys that much them to,</v>

920
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.660
<v Speaker 1>or there was guys who were like,</v>

921
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.690
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that can't quite spar than then you have to fight them.</v>

922
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.411
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

923
00:24:16.411 --> 00:24:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

924
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come so hard.</v>

925
00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:18.840
<v Speaker 1>You almost have to fight them.</v>

926
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And that I don't,</v>

927
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:21.074
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do,</v>

928
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:21.940
<v Speaker 3>are you still doing it?</v>

929
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:22.803
<v Speaker 3>Are you still,</v>

930
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:23.800
<v Speaker 3>after you wrote the book?</v>

931
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I did it,</v>

932
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

933
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>this was a big thing that this was the big surprise for me about doing this</v>

934
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 1>whole project was,</v>

935
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.601
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

936
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I wa I look at it from across the street.</v>

937
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd always been a fan,</v>

938
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 1>but I never really wanted to do it myself.</v>

939
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do Jujitsu,</v>

940
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.550
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really want to be a cage fighter.</v>

941
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

942
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 1>it didn't look like fun to me.</v>

943
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It looked like about as much fun as torture.</v>

944
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

945
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It looks scary and painful.</v>

946
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

947
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and the biggest shock for me was that I loved it.</v>

948
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.823
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

949
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

950
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 1>so I expected to do it for a year and then to quit the absolute second.</v>

951
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:53.360
<v Speaker 1>My fight was over.</v>

952
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

953
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:55.761
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

955
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.594
<v Speaker 1>I'm retired.</v>

956
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll go write the book.</v>

957
00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

958
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.881
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

959
00:24:58.881 --> 00:24:59.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

960
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I kept doing it for a couple of years longer,</v>

961
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

962
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:03.440
<v Speaker 1>because I really loved it.</v>

963
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I loved the Camaraderie.</v>

964
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I love the challenge of it.</v>

965
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Love the way it made me feel.</v>

966
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:07.334
<v Speaker 1>I love the way,</v>

967
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>gave me this ability to live a sort of head long life,</v>

969
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

970
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 1>for a couple hours a week is all.</v>

971
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by headlong?</v>

972
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:15.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

973
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I had this restraint in my life.</v>

974
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

975
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

976
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor,</v>

977
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I had this really a dull life and a lot of ways.</v>

979
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 1>And then just for a few hours a week,</v>

980
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I go in and I take these risks and then Jim and I,</v>

981
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.680
<v Speaker 1>and I experienced these big emotions and these big,</v>

982
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.700
<v Speaker 1>these big highs,</v>

983
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

984
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And then about a year ago I was so beat up that I really just couldn't continue</v>

985
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

986
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And giving up was one of the hardest things I've ever done.</v>

987
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.161
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

988
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

989
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

990
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I kind of felt like this romance in my life had come to an end and I was too</v>

991
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 1>brittle and too old,</v>

992
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

993
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:48.920
<v Speaker 1>to recapture it.</v>

994
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 1>What was the issue like physically?</v>

995
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I always expected for it to end badly.</v>

996
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:54.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

997
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was kind of pushed my luck and I figured that,</v>

998
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I figured I'd go out on my shield at some point.</v>

999
00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:00.830
<v Speaker 1>You'll go out on a stretcher after some horrible head injury or blow out my knee</v>

1000
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:01.664
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1001
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that though.</v>

1002
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:03.854
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a,</v>

1003
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.680
<v Speaker 1>a an accumulation of little things,</v>

1004
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 1>a rickety old man stuff,</v>

1005
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1006
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you just get older and you start picking up these little injuries and they don't</v>

1007
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:12.644
<v Speaker 1>go away.</v>

1008
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1009
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>so I got,</v>

1010
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:13.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I kept getting turf toe from kicks and from getting stuck on the mat and that</v>

1012
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.020
<v Speaker 1>turned into arthritis at some point.</v>

1013
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 1>And I've pulled my groin bad and that's been bad and then mess up my neck one</v>

1014
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:25.791
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1015
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1016
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it was never been quite the same,</v>

1017
00:26:27.861 --> 00:26:28.071
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1018
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1019
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.720
<v Speaker 1>just got rickety and a pardon reason I had started going to hot yoga as we said</v>

1020
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.823
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1021
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.460
<v Speaker 1>is in hopes of carrying all this stuff,</v>

1022
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:37.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1023
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>getting any physically health,</v>

1024
00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>getting my flexibility better so I can't get back in the gym.</v>

1025
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever want to do hardcore and</v>

1026
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.890
<v Speaker 2>the main sparring anymore.</v>

1027
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to get hit in the head anymore.</v>

1028
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1029
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 2>but I do want to get back into the grappling elements of it.</v>

1030
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:49.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about it before the podcast started that I've become addicted</v>

1032
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 2>the last few weeks to yoga.</v>

1033
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1034
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

1035
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:55.944
<v Speaker 2>It just kept,</v>

1037
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1038
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I've got this reoccurring,</v>

1039
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1040
00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1041
00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.760
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1042
00:26:59.760 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1043
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.211
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1044
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 2>I have a pulled muscle in my,</v>

1045
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 2>but very uncomfortable to talk about it.</v>

1046
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1047
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.001
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1048
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1049
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:06.751
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1050
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:07.051
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1051
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:10.190
<v Speaker 2>it's aggravated when I throw kicks and so I wasn't throwing kicks for awhile,</v>

1052
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 2>but there's certain punches when I'd just push off of it.</v>

1053
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It just is something about exploding.</v>

1054
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:15.841
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1055
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:16.250
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1056
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I gotta stretch out my back so he's fucked up.</v>

1057
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 2>And so I started taking a hot yoga like a,</v>

1058
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.920
<v Speaker 2>about a week and a half ago.</v>

1059
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.731
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1060
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:23.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1061
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 2>like almost immediately I found out that it calmed me down.</v>

1062
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Like almost immediately.</v>

1063
00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 2>It was like my stress level just dropped tremendously.</v>

1064
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1065
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I had done it before,</v>

1066
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 2>but I've been real inconsistent about it.</v>

1067
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to do four days a week for like a year.</v>

1068
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.350
<v Speaker 2>That's my,</v>

1069
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.183
<v Speaker 2>that's my goal too.</v>

1070
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1071
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.110
<v Speaker 2>well can you do it on back to back days?</v>

1072
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:43.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 2>You can often feel so tired from it on the second day.</v>

1074
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Muscularly tired.</v>

1075
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:47.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1076
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I didn't expect about Yoga is how difficult it is.</v>

1077
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean I knew it was like,</v>

1079
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were,</v>

1080
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was be in a hot room.</v>

1081
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Stretching.</v>

1082
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.293
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought it was.</v>

1083
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.163
<v Speaker 2>I know what I mean.</v>

1084
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.220
<v Speaker 2>But it is,</v>

1085
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean the level of exertion is really extraordinary.</v>

1086
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It's harder than a lot of Jujitsu classes and people are going to say,</v>

1087
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

1088
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1089
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.660
<v Speaker 2>if I have to roll with five blue belts that are my size or do a class in hot</v>

1090
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:09.421
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>

1091
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it's harder to do yoga.</v>

1092
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Cause if a guy's under my level,</v>

1094
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I can pretty much control what happens.</v>

1095
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.171
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1096
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:16.501
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

1097
00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I could hold positions,</v>

1098
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I could choose to take breaks and you know,</v>

1099
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I can mount them and just relax,</v>

1100
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.270
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1101
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.110
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1103
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

1104
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.583
<v Speaker 2>he can't do that.</v>

1105
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 2>If you're fighting for your life.</v>

1106
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:27.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1107
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.080
<v Speaker 2>you can get someone good if you're grappling with someone really good.</v>

1108
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is harder because it's fighting to the death.</v>

1109
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.261
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1110
00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 2>if there's someone who's just just a little bit better than you or a solid notch</v>

1111
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 2>better than you and they're trying to kill you and you're,</v>

1112
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly on the,</v>

1113
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.790
<v Speaker 2>they're not good enough that you're in total defensive mode,</v>

1114
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you're still,</v>

1115
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:45.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1116
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1117
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 2>you're still in the game.</v>

1118
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Gets a heart attack stages where you're like,</v>

1119
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:50.760
<v Speaker 2>this might end right here.</v>

1120
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 2>This whole fucking life on this planet might end right here for me.</v>

1121
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.541
<v Speaker 2>It would be a good look.</v>

1122
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a good death for you.</v>

1123
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not the worst death.</v>

1124
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1125
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 2>but yoga is almost as difficult.</v>

1126
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard.</v>

1127
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1128
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I was going to write something about it,</v>

1129
00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 2>like I might ride it still like a blog entry about how there's this life or</v>

1130
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:10.340
<v Speaker 2>death struggle that's going on,</v>

1131
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>these hot rooms all over the country and no one knows how difficult it really</v>

1132
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:15.451
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1133
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks it's like really easy because a bunch of women are doing it.</v>

1134
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1135
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:19.561
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1136
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I think guys don't get it at all cause I'm always there and it's,</v>

1137
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:22.491
<v Speaker 2>and I kind of like the,</v>

1138
00:29:22.491 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 2>the female environment of it.</v>

1139
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:29:24.391 --> 00:29:24.871
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

1141
00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:27.000
<v Speaker 2>It's such a big transition from the gym,</v>

1142
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:27.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 2>where like it's noncompetitive in the hole.</v>

1144
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Even if it was a male teacher,</v>

1145
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.020
<v Speaker 2>the whole culture is still female,</v>

1146
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1147
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:34.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1148
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:35.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1149
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a feminine culture.</v>

1150
00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:39.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's none of the macho stuff is going right.</v>

1151
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1152
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.501
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>

1153
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 2>you're not trying to vanquish the room at hot yoga like you will be possibly if</v>

1154
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:45.071
<v Speaker 2>you were at the gym,</v>

1155
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:45.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1156
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1157
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:46.820
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

1158
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I just dig it and I think it's a main thing that people don't get about it</v>

1159
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 2>because I would've thought I would've had the same stereotypes.</v>

1160
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:52.691
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people have.</v>

1161
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a sissy thing to do.</v>

1162
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.260
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing sissy about it.</v>

1163
00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:55.601
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1164
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:55.961
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1165
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1166
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 2>it's really a hard thing.</v>

1167
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:57.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:29:57.701 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 2>It just has a weird connotation.</v>

1169
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:00.551
<v Speaker 2>For some reason.</v>

1170
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:01.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird,</v>

1171
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 2>we have this weird perception of it because we see girls and tights.</v>

1172
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 2>How could they be working?</v>

1173
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:07.821
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1174
00:30:07.821 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

1175
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.311
<v Speaker 2>I want you to check.</v>

1176
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:10.144
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they're not,</v>

1177
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I do get the feeling that I am working harder because,</v>

1178
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 2>because I'm newer and I have to work really hard to get into these positions</v>

1179
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:19.420
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not sure I'm not my flexibility socks.</v>

1180
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.591
<v Speaker 2>And when he thinks women,</v>

1181
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are super flexible and they seem to get into those positions</v>

1182
00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:28.711
<v Speaker 2>pretty effortlessly and hold them with less vibration than I'm holding them.</v>

1183
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what mean?</v>

1184
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Some for sure,</v>

1185
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.631
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>

1186
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this one lady that uh,</v>

1187
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I go to this class and she's,</v>

1188
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 2>she's got to take a break.</v>

1189
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Like every other post,</v>

1190
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 2>she's barely getting through it.</v>

1191
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>She's very out of shape and she's attempting to do this very difficult class and</v>

1192
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:46.150
<v Speaker 2>there's certain certain things when I do it where I'm like,</v>

1193
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

1194
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I could barely hang in here until this guy calls it.</v>

1195
00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1196
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

1197
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 2>But in other ones it's a breeze where other people were really struggling.</v>

1198
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.170
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the instructor you mean?</v>

1199
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.511
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1200
00:30:56.511 --> 00:30:56.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1201
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1202
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.290
<v Speaker 2>The flexibility.</v>

1203
00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:58.991
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1204
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of flexibility in my legs,</v>

1205
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:05.410
<v Speaker 2>like kicking flexibility and so there's certain poses where everybody else is</v>

1206
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>struggling and I'm taking a break.</v>

1207
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1208
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.491
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>

1209
00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I can relax here.</v>

1210
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Arms back.</v>

1211
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1212
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:10.840
<v Speaker 2>that can do all that.</v>

1213
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 2>But the big one is like stretching my legs out,</v>

1214
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 2>putting my body forward,</v>

1215
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.080
<v Speaker 2>or with a lot of people they're holding it,</v>

1216
00:31:17.081 --> 00:31:17.480
<v Speaker 2>holding it.</v>

1217
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1218
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I can go to sleep here.</v>

1219
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's nice.</v>

1220
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I get little breaks now for me,</v>

1221
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:21.671
<v Speaker 2>I'm fighting,</v>

1222
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm fighting for my life in that position.</v>

1223
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.180
<v Speaker 2>And having that voice in my head is is,</v>

1224
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:25.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:26.930
<v Speaker 2>like you can do it pause.</v>

1226
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 2>But then there's other ones where I'm just fucking dying.</v>

1227
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1228
00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:32.641
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1229
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.910
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult.</v>

1230
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.833
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1231
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.320
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1232
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a balance issue and I think when you're all the time,</v>

1233
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.410
<v Speaker 2>all the explosion lifting weights,</v>

1234
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.030
<v Speaker 2>kettlebells,</v>

1235
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:43.863
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1236
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1237
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to do like static tension relieving,</v>

1238
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>long holding those poses,</v>

1239
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 2>stretching,</v>

1240
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.830
<v Speaker 2>elongating the muscle,</v>

1241
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:55.450
<v Speaker 2>stretching out all the tissue,</v>

1242
00:31:55.451 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 2>stretching out the hamstrings and the back muscles.</v>

1243
00:31:58.601 --> 00:31:59.434
<v Speaker 2>And there's so much,</v>

1244
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 2>so much stretching going on.</v>

1245
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I realize when I'm doing it,</v>

1246
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:02.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1247
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:03.041
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1248
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever do this.</v>

1249
00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1250
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I never lengthen everything out.</v>

1251
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Everything is just getting compressed.</v>

1252
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.873
<v Speaker 2>Everything is,</v>

1253
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 2>everything is explosion and all this fucking heavyweight and there's a,</v>

1254
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I think you need balance.</v>

1255
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:18.071
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's,</v>

1256
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you should have only yoga.</v>

1257
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:20.223
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it's,</v>

1258
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to put weight on your body and your muscles because it's good</v>

1259
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:24.630
<v Speaker 2>for your density,</v>

1260
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.210
<v Speaker 2>your bones.</v>

1261
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 2>It maintains mass.</v>

1262
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1263
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.850
<v Speaker 2>it keeps you from getting frail as,</v>

1264
00:32:28.851 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 2>especially as you get older.</v>

1265
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.230
<v Speaker 2>But I think stretching and yoga positions should be almost mandatory for people</v>

1266
00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Speaker 2>to get their shit together.</v>

1267
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:36.881
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1268
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:37.061
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1269
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:37.301
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1270
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 2>it makes you way calmer.</v>

1271
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.043
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1272
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wish w I w I wonder if it's just physical tension being released or if</v>

1273
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.900
<v Speaker 2>just stretching itself,</v>

1274
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 2>if there's something in the act of doing so that just when it's over,</v>

1275
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 2>everything else just seems like calm and relaxed.</v>

1276
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Like the difficulty of those poses.</v>

1277
00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:58.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like it was just,</v>

1279
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it burns through so much energy.</v>

1280
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't have anything less to tor left to torture yourself with afterwards.</v>

1281
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:07.521
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1282
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:07.711
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1283
00:33:07.711 --> 00:33:10.570
<v Speaker 2>the anxiety's kind of burned through and now I had the same sense.</v>

1284
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.433
<v Speaker 2>You did it the first time I did.</v>

1285
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.661
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1286
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:12.111
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1287
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:14.090
<v Speaker 2>this is the healthiest thing I've ever done in my life.</v>

1288
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 2>How long you've been doing it?</v>

1289
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I've done like 10 classes,</v>

1290
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 2>so I'm still at that stage of like,</v>

1291
00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1292
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.260
<v Speaker 2>converts people,</v>

1293
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1294
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1295
00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm a blue belt disease.</v>

1296
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Like just before you get a blue belt Jujitsu guys just to want to talk about</v>

1297
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 2>anything but Jujitsu.</v>

1298
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 2>So you want to do it to a point where you get healthy enough to go back to</v>

1299
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:33.500

1323
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:50.361
<v Speaker 2>When I met him,</v>

1324
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.141
<v Speaker 2>drank crazy.</v>

1325
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Lee has he quit drinking a lot?</v>

1326
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:52.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1327
00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 2>he quit smoking.</v>

1328
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 2>He quit smoking when he had his daughter.</v>

1329
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1330
00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.450
<v Speaker 2>which was just right.</v>

1331
00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:58.671
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1332
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Cause right around when I was meeting him and um,</v>

1333
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.150
<v Speaker 2>was just eating whatever the fuck you wanted to getting,</v>

1334
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:05.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1335
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 2>a belly and drinking all the time and traveling around the world.</v>

1336
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 2>And then his wife is a maniac.</v>

1337
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 2>His wife is a Jujitsu fiend,</v>

1338
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:16.340
<v Speaker 2>but I see a guy like that and I'm like at 58 years old.</v>

1339
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:17.081
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

1340
00:34:17.081 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 2>how much can his body [inaudible] he's doing it like twice a day.</v>

1341
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he's doing any yoga or anything to counteract just,</v>

1342
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1343
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 2>just age related degeneration.</v>

1344
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1345
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I often wonder that about,</v>

1346
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1347
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 2>about that myself,</v>

1348
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like the fact that he wasn't athletic for most of his life means</v>

1349
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 2>that he hit,</v>

1350
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't put a lot of hard miles on himself.</v>

1351
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.483
<v Speaker 2>That could be true.</v>

1352
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:37.790
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1353
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 2>now you've got a lot of hard miles on yourself.</v>

1354
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I got quite a few hard miles.</v>

1355
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm less now,</v>

1356
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:41.983
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1357
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1358
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of fucking hard miles on this body.</v>

1359
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of surgeries,</v>

1360
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 2>a lot of injuries and but works amazingly well.</v>

1361
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.600
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of that is because I don't have a conventional job.</v>

1362
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that today when I did that class,</v>

1363
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.241
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1364
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:58.010
<v Speaker 2>how many fucking people have an hour and a half,</v>

1365
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the day or at nine o'clock in the morning to go in there and you</v>

1367
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.890
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1368
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 2>stretch out in the fucking sweat box for an hour and a half.</v>

1369
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Most people just don't have that time.</v>

1370
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get home you have,</v>

1371
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1372
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 2>your family and bills and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and you have all</v>

1373
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:15.920
<v Speaker 2>this shit to deal with.</v>

1374
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't have the time to to put in for body maintenance for the proper</v>

1375
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:21.794
<v Speaker 2>body maintenance.</v>

1376
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.633
<v Speaker 2>It's very true.</v>

1377
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 2>It comes down to the conversation with a friend about nutrition.</v>

1378
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Like they were asking me like what kind of,</v>

1379
00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 2>which kind of supplement should I get,</v>

1380
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:29.714
<v Speaker 2>what should I do?</v>

1381
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.261
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1382
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:30.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1383
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 2>one of the first thing you should do is find a qualified doctor and get your</v>

1384
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:33.981
<v Speaker 2>blood work done.</v>

1385
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Find out where your nutrition levels are at,</v>

1386
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 2>what your vitamin levels are.</v>

1387
00:35:37.141 --> 00:35:37.351
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1388
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:37.981
<v Speaker 2>let's find out,</v>

1389
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 2>like eat what you normally eat.</v>

1390
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:40.111
<v Speaker 2>Don't get,</v>

1391
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to get crazy and try to fix it,</v>

1392
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.980
<v Speaker 2>but eat what you normally eat.</v>

1393
00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And then let's find out what,</v>

1394
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>what do you need?</v>

1395
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1396
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:47.541
<v Speaker 2>most people like,</v>

1397
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1398
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 2>that's how much time.</v>

1399
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:49.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:35:49.101 --> 00:35:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Then all the energy and time for a doctor and do the research.</v>

1401
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of work.</v>

1402
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1403
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.770
<v Speaker 2>it's jobs or bullshit.</v>

1404
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>

1405
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.983
<v Speaker 2>They're bullshit.</v>

1406
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1407
00:35:58.351 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 2>part of what you were feeling when you saw those guys across the street and</v>

1410
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:36:09.761 --> 00:36:10.750
<v Speaker 1>the cage is the cage.</v>

1413
00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.613
<v Speaker 1>It's fighting cage,</v>

1414
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's also my office.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1445
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1446
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching a lot of writing classes,</v>

1447
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1448
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 1>especially freshmen writing and freshmen writing and my college was mandatory.</v>

1449
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1450
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 1>which means that everyone there is a captive and most college courses you get to</v>

1451
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:57.210
<v Speaker 1>take whatever you want to take cause there's electives,</v>

1452
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 1>you're not forced to be anywhere.</v>

1453
00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 1>This is a class you're forced to be.</v>

1454
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I was teaching freshman composition over and over and over again to</v>

1455
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:05.310
<v Speaker 1>students who just didn't,</v>

1456
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.241
<v Speaker 1>couldn't care less,</v>

1457
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:07.074
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1458
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1459
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 1>and so that was lame.</v>

1460
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Or the main problem though was that I was an adjunct.</v>

1461
00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:11.491
<v Speaker 1>You don't an adjunct.</v>

1462
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that just like if not a full time faculty member?</v>

1463
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:15.571
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1464
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:15.961
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1465
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:16.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1466
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1467
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.821
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1468
00:37:16.821 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 1>for like,</v>

1469
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.241
<v Speaker 1>almost 10 years,</v>

1470
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm making about 16 grand a year,</v>

1471
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1472
00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:20.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1473
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.191
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

1474
00:37:21.191 --> 00:37:21.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1475
00:37:21.261 --> 00:37:21.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1476
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:22.324
<v Speaker 1>just kind of,</v>

1477
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of chasing this dream of being a,</v>

1478
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160
<v Speaker 1>a boyhood dream,</v>

1479
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 1>really of being a college professor,</v>

1480
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 1>of being a scholar.</v>

1481
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be that guy,</v>

1482
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:35.061
<v Speaker 1>like the guy who makes some small but meaningful contribution to knowledge.</v>

1483
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And I had been chasing that dream for a long time and writing books and tune it,</v>

1484
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.240
<v Speaker 1>written the articles and doing all kinds of stuff.</v>

1485
00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 1>But it just wasn't,</v>

1486
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1487
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 1>my research was a little bit nonconventional and it just wasn't,</v>

1488
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't making it,</v>

1489
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1490
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1491
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1492
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.200
<v Speaker 1>and I just didn't have the courage to quit.</v>

1493
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.161
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

1494
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a courage thing or if it was a,</v>

1495
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1496
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:58.400
<v Speaker 1>a desire thing.</v>

1497
00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:58.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1498
00:37:58.631 --> 00:37:58.951
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

1499
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't like quitting on something that I've invested in target.</v>

1500
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1501
00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:01.621
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1502
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:02.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're gambling,</v>

1503
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:02.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1504
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you throw money in the pot,</v>

1505
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to fucking fold,</v>

1506
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:05.761
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>

1507
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:06.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1508
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:06.864
<v Speaker 1>you should fold.</v>

1509
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And so when I started,</v>

1510
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 1>when I went across the street that first time,</v>

1511
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.180
<v Speaker 1>and I made that joke at my own expense of,</v>

1512
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be funny if I went over there.</v>

1513
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Part of it,</v>

1514
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.370
<v Speaker 1>part of what was driving me to cross over there,</v>

1515
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 1>it was a career suicide fantasy.</v>

1516
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking to myself,</v>

1517
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 1>why you apparently don't have the courage to quit your job and move on to</v>

1518
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:23.874
<v Speaker 1>something else?</v>

1519
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can do something offensive enough to people in your profession that</v>

1520
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.533
<v Speaker 1>will get you fired.</v>

1521
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1522
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.010
<v Speaker 1>so if I showed up in the cage,</v>

1523
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 1>everybody in my department will be able to honest to God,</v>

1524
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 1>like up from the poems they were reading,</v>

1525
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1526
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:37.841
<v Speaker 1>reading their poems,</v>

1527
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>they look up and they'd be able to see me right across the street,</v>

1528
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1529
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1530
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:45.640
<v Speaker 1>engaged in bloodsport and they don't really approve of a bloodsport and English</v>

1531
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>

1532
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>What has the reaction been amongst your peers?</v>

1533
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1534
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1535
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.393
<v Speaker 1>Career suicide,</v>

1536
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1537
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:52.690
<v Speaker 1>suicide fantasy.</v>

1538
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1539
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1540
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 1>So I went over there thinking,</v>

1541
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1542
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I can't quit me back and get myself fired.</v>

1543
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1544
00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>on my,</v>

1545
00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 1>on my campus.</v>

1546
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1547
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 1>people were much more tolerant and open minded than I had hoped.</v>

1548
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:06.581
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get.</v>

1549
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get furious with me.</v>

1550
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>

1551
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 1>they didn't try to fire me.</v>

1552
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It's because they know me.</v>

1553
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 1>They know I'm not a savage animal.</v>

1554
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:13.691
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>

1555
00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1556
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:15.790
<v Speaker 1>the enormity decent human being.</v>

1558
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1559
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:16.961
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1560
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the bigger question is what,</v>

1561
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:22.750
<v Speaker 1>what effect will have within the larger profession will be an effective career</v>

1562
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:23.920
<v Speaker 1>suicide strategy.</v>

1563
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Once other people in the profession get ahold of the book.</v>

1564
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And I do think probably it'll be a success.</v>

1565
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a career suicide strategy.</v>

1566
00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1567
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 1>about two weeks after the book came out,</v>

1568
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:33.610
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1569
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:33.851
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1570
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:34.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1571
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 1>article came out about me and about the book,</v>

1572
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1573
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 1>in this magazine that no one reads in the real world called the chronicle of</v>

1574
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:41.224
<v Speaker 1>higher education,</v>

1575
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's the main trade magazine for academia.</v>

1576
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And the book comes off pretty much as a glorification of Macho,</v>

1577
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.900
<v Speaker 1>barbarism and their in their,</v>

1578
00:39:52.901 --> 00:39:53.561
<v Speaker 1>in their thinking,</v>

1579
00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:53.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1580
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 1>what a dumb,</v>

1581
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 1>a dumb glorification of butchery and barbarism.</v>

1582
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 1>He might mean butchery even.</v>

1583
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1584
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you just using that word and Sam savagery,</v>

1585
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Speaker 1>sat,</v>

1586
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.220
<v Speaker 1>savagery,</v>

1587
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 1>barbarism.</v>

1588
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1589
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.170
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like it was written by a pussy.</v>

1590
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:09.743
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1591
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that.</v>

1592
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So that could be effective in ending my career because that,</v>

1593
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 1>that's a guy,</v>

1594
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.680
<v Speaker 1>like I read about that and I read the article,</v>

1595
00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1596
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like I said to my wife like,</v>

1597
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:19.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1598
00:40:19.691 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 1>that ends up there.</v>

1599
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.473
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1600
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1601
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.253
<v Speaker 1>Well written.</v>

1602
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:23.851
<v Speaker 1>Well read.</v>

1603
00:40:23.851 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Did Guy have a points?</v>

1604
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1605
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.793
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1606
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:27.041
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1607
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all going to be well written.</v>

1608
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have points cause he's a good writer,</v>

1609
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1610
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.520
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1611
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:32.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1612
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's good journalism,</v>

1613
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.283
<v Speaker 1>but it's good writing.</v>

1614
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Well it's editorial.</v>

1615
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1616
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean whenever you're yeah,</v>

1617
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.210
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

1618
00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:39.551
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

1619
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 1>it was a feature,</v>

1620
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:41.403
<v Speaker 1>a sort of portrait.</v>

1621
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.603
<v Speaker 1>And instead of,</v>

1622
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>instead of making an actual portrait,</v>

1623
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 1>he sort of drew a caricature,</v>

1624
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1625
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.520
<v Speaker 1>a caricature of you or have we and the book and the,</v>

1626
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.210
<v Speaker 1>of what you're trying to accomplish or of the sport itself.</v>

1627
00:40:53.211 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you one example.</v>

1628
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:54.904
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1629
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.571
<v Speaker 1>one example,</v>

1630
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:56.740
<v Speaker 1>he quotes in the book is like,</v>

1631
00:40:56.741 --> 00:40:57.574
<v Speaker 1>we're at lunch,</v>

1632
00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1633
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 1>and we're having a nice time.</v>

1634
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1635
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1636
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and at some point I lean across the table toward him and I say to him like,</v>

1637
00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:06.371
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1638
00:41:06.371 --> 00:41:06.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1639
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>across the table in an intimidating fashion,</v>

1640
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.150
<v Speaker 1>what would it take?</v>

1641
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>What would I have to say to get you to punch me in the face?</v>

1642
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 1>That would just said to him,</v>

1643
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.821
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1644
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:15.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1645
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:16.774
<v Speaker 1>I said it to him,</v>

1646
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.070
<v Speaker 1>but if he's 80,</v>

1647
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 1>strip out all the damn context.</v>

1648
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1649
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.290
<v Speaker 1>So in context that,</v>

1650
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:21.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1651
00:41:21.471 --> 00:41:24.850
<v Speaker 1>that statement is about me saying how hard it is to get guys punch you in the</v>

1652
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:27.100
<v Speaker 1>face that men are fairly peaceable,</v>

1653
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.080
<v Speaker 1>minutemen avoid conflict.</v>

1654
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1655
00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 1>they're very fairly prudent about throwing their,</v>

1656
00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:31.781
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1657
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:32.620
<v Speaker 1>their fists around.</v>

1658
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Most guys will go</v>

1659
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 3>to great lengths to find a face saving way out of a violent confrontation.</v>

1660
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 3>So within context,</v>

1661
00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1662
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 3>the statement was almost the opposite of what it made.</v>

1663
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:44.270
<v Speaker 3>It made it seem like,</v>

1664
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1665
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 3>So in his words,</v>

1666
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 3>you were trying,</v>

1667
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you were intimidating him and pretty much,</v>

1668
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1669
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe that's just how he took it.</v>

1670
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Some people are super uncomfortable with any idea it like any form of conflict,</v>

1671
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
00:41:58.791 --> 00:41:59.560
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

1673
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 3>they would like to categorize any,</v>

1674
00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 3>any kind of violent interaction,</v>

1675
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:08.480
<v Speaker 3>even voluntary violent interaction like mixed martial arts competition as being</v>

1676
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.411
<v Speaker 3>barbaric,</v>

1677
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 3>as having no virtue as having no,</v>

1678
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1679
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.610
<v Speaker 3>there's no nobility.</v>

1680
00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1681
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I get that too.</v>

1682
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:15.151
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1683
00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1684
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's harder for you to get into that mind space,</v>

1685
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's not hard for me to get into that mind space,</v>

1686
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 3>mind space of person who looks at that and sees no redemption in it.</v>

1687
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Nothing good about it.</v>

1688
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a hard time.</v>

1689
00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 3>It's easy for me to get into.</v>

1690
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:29.970
<v Speaker 3>It sounds crazy because I,</v>

1691
00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1692
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 3>it's my job.</v>

1693
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm a mixed martial arts commentator for the university,</v>

1694
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:37.250
<v Speaker 3>but I have a problem with,</v>

1695
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with the damage.</v>

1696
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:39.920
<v Speaker 3>I have a pro.</v>

1697
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.570
<v Speaker 3>I was living three existence.</v>

1698
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 3>It's going to ask you about that.</v>

1699
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1700
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1701
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 3>I love watching fights.</v>

1702
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I have always loved watching fights.</v>

1703
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.590
<v Speaker 3>I love that people,</v>

1704
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1705
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.510
<v Speaker 3>have this burning desire in them to do what I think is the most difficult sport</v>

1706
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.613
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

1707
00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything even close.</v>

1708
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I think as far as the emotions that are invested in,</v>

1709
00:43:03.071 --> 00:43:03.730
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1710
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.920
<v Speaker 3>in trying to win and the debt,</v>

1711
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.790
<v Speaker 3>devastating effect of a loss and then the actual physical damage that you take</v>

1712
00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 3>along the way you or your vehicle that you were racing is your own body.</v>

1713
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.150
<v Speaker 3>And unlike a race car,</v>

1714
00:43:17.151 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 3>your body will respond only if you push it.</v>

1715
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:21.621
<v Speaker 3>And Training,</v>

1716
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:24.050
<v Speaker 3>you have to elevate its capacity.</v>

1717
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You have to elevate its tolerances and you have to do that intelligently and it</v>

1718
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 3>has to be done in the watchful eye of trainers.</v>

1719
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:32.331
<v Speaker 3>And along the way,</v>

1720
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>there's all these variables you have to take into account strength and</v>

1721
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:36.164
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>

1722
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a body type or you're dealing with what you know,</v>

1723
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:40.730
<v Speaker 3>what skill set do you have?</v>

1724
00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 3>What needs to be improved?</v>

1725
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Objectivity objectively and analyzing your strengths and weaknesses,</v>

1726
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:47.670
<v Speaker 3>looking at your skill set,</v>

1727
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.680
<v Speaker 3>looking at the weapons that you have that you need to keep sharp and looking at</v>

1728
00:43:51.681 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 3>ones that you need to acquire.</v>

1729
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.980
<v Speaker 3>There's so many variables.</v>

1730
00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:58.130
<v Speaker 3>To me it's the ultimate problem solving.</v>

1731
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.560
<v Speaker 3>High level competition.</v>

1732
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything like it,</v>

1733
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.180
<v Speaker 3>but I have a problem with a lot of the ass.</v>

1734
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a lot of problem with a lot of the thuggish behavior.</v>

1735
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with a,</v>

1736
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean even though I know a lot of it is psychological warfare and trying to</v>

1737
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:14.331
<v Speaker 3>intimidate each other,</v>

1738
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.410
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with some of that.</v>

1739
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with the damage that guys tick.</v>

1740
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.460
<v Speaker 3>I've written a real problem with that.</v>

1741
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I have a real problem with guys not knowing when to get out with their friends,</v>

1742
00:44:23.331 --> 00:44:23.931
<v Speaker 3>telling them,</v>

1743
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:24.591
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

1744
00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:26.120
<v Speaker 3>she's got to put together one hard.</v>

1745
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:26.571
<v Speaker 3>Can't be like,</v>

1746
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1747
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:27.471
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1748
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 3>He's been knocked out seven fucking times.</v>

1749
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:30.231
<v Speaker 3>Like No.</v>

1750
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:33.630
<v Speaker 3>He needs to preserve his brain for the rest of his life.</v>

1751
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever met an old man that used to fight?</v>

1752
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

1753
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun.</v>

1754
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun at all.</v>

1755
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1756
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.870
<v Speaker 3>it's very uncomfortable to talk to a guy who tells the same fucking story over</v>

1757
00:44:43.871 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 3>and over and over and over and over and over.</v>

1758
00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1759
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1760
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.373
<v Speaker 3>Yes I do.</v>

1761
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 3>And I know UFC fighters who didn't use to be like that,</v>

1762
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 3>who are like that now.</v>

1763
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And there's some of my all time favorites.</v>

1764
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.390
<v Speaker 3>This is the big question for me.</v>

1765
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask one more question.</v>

1766
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 3>The other day on the podcast,</v>

1767
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned a Howard Cosell given up that work after seeing a particularly</v>

1768
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:05.604
<v Speaker 3>gruesome fight.</v>

1769
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.541
<v Speaker 3>Larry Holmes.</v>

1770
00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:07.374
<v Speaker 3>Tux Cob.</v>

1771
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1772
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.611
<v Speaker 3>You ever,</v>

1773
00:45:08.611 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 3>you ever think that could happen to you?</v>

1774
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:11.903
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1775
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.410
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

1776
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1777
00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.860
<v Speaker 3>It's possible that there'll come a day where I can't do it anymore,</v>

1778
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 3>that I don't want to do it anymore.</v>

1779
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably always be a fan.</v>

1780
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:21.023
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1781
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1782
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.700
<v Speaker 3>to some extent look,</v>

1783
00:45:22.701 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 3>but like my favorite guys,</v>

1784
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:24.804
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse,</v>

1785
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:25.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1786
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 3>people think like my all time favorite guys are some of the craziest,</v>

1787
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 3>like Vandelay Silva is one of my all time favorite,</v>

1788
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 3>just cause his fights were fucking chaos.</v>

1789
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 3>You knew if you're going to watch a Vandelay Silva fight,</v>

1790
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.760
<v Speaker 3>that dude across the ring and he's wiggling his wrists back in the pride days</v>

1791
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:43.240
<v Speaker 3>doing this shit and he wa he,</v>

1792
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1793
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.320
<v Speaker 3>he was probably one of the best middleweights ever.</v>

1794
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1795
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:47.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1796
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 3>or light heavyweight in that division is two oh three,</v>

1797
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:50.641
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>

1798
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 3>they called it middle weight.</v>

1799
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 3>They called,</v>

1800
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.183
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1801
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.230
<v Speaker 3>the actual called,</v>

1802
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1803
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 3>they called the one 85 pound division was welterweight,</v>

1804
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.733
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1805
00:45:58.830 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1806
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 3>but Vandelay who was just the opposite of like mighty mouse,</v>

1807
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 3>like mighty mouse is my favorite currently because he fights so fucking</v>

1808
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 3>intelligently.</v>

1809
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Everything he does,</v>

1810
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 3>his movement,</v>

1811
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 3>his footwork is positioning.</v>

1812
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.810
<v Speaker 3>He's always in condition is conditioning is insane.</v>

1813
00:46:15.811 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 3>They could just push guys to the point where they just cannot keep up with him</v>

1814
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.131
<v Speaker 3>and his,</v>

1815
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 3>just his technical superiority over all of the competition.</v>

1816
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:25.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just so obvious.</v>

1817
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 3>And his work ethic,</v>

1818
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 3>his intelligence,</v>

1819
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 3>he's a great role model.</v>

1820
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 3>When you hear him talk,</v>

1821
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:32.430
<v Speaker 3>he's a very intelligent young man,</v>

1822
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.380
<v Speaker 3>but also humble and friendly.</v>

1823
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:35.423
<v Speaker 3>I mean he did.</v>

1824
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 3>You see him,</v>

1825
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:38.450
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that tells you that guy's a martial arts fighters,</v>

1826
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.293
<v Speaker 3>his ears.</v>

1827
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.080
<v Speaker 3>You look at him,</v>

1828
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.880
<v Speaker 3>he seemed so friendly and so nice,</v>

1829
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:42.631
<v Speaker 3>but then he gets in there,</v>

1830
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 3>he's the baddest motherfucker on the world.</v>

1831
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Pound for pound in my opinion.</v>

1832
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1833
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1834
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.860
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just 125 pounds.</v>

1835
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.920
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1836
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.220
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't get the attention because of the,</v>

1837
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:50.910
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1838
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:51.661
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1839
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 3>other than that fade or who's just violence,</v>

1840
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.510
<v Speaker 3>every one of his fights was Zvi,</v>

1841
00:46:55.511 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 3>but PR intelligence and Anderson who was just a wizard and understanding his</v>

1842
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 3>prime was the wizard of all wizards.</v>

1843
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.830
<v Speaker 3>He would pull off things where you just go get the fuck outta here.</v>

1844
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 3>What did I just say?</v>

1845
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1846
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 3>my favorite has always been Machida,</v>

1847
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 3>which he's great tennis.</v>

1848
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something,</v>

1849
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 3>there's a beauty and grace to the way he fights.</v>

1850
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 3>He reminds me of a matador.</v>

1851
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:18.720
<v Speaker 3>He kind of looks like a matador and it's got that kind of dark complexion and</v>

1852
00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:19.501
<v Speaker 3>dark hair.</v>

1853
00:47:19.501 --> 00:47:20.660
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1854
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I think Machita we spent too much of his career at fighting at two oh five</v>

1855
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.110
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

1856
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.180
<v Speaker 3>He's too small for one 85 which is crazy.</v>

1857
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Rockhold tore some rock holds a and</v>

1858
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:30.551
<v Speaker 2>the and,</v>

1859
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:31.221
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1860
00:47:31.221 --> 00:47:32.054
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1861
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 2>who's Weidman is wave is way more here too.</v>

1862
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know anything about a fight.</v>

1863
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Romero who's going to more from to from Marilyn's Hue.</v>

1864
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 2>So he's taking the abuse from these huge guys.</v>

1865
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how he fought at two oh five for so long.</v>

1867
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:50.530
<v Speaker 2>He would weigh in at two oh three and like not cut any weight at all.</v>

1868
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And then fight Tito Ortiz.</v>

1869
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Who Weight two 30 or so.</v>

1870
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a big giant dude.</v>

1871
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean he fought Jago Silva was huge at two oh five he taught.</v>

1872
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Fought some big ass fucking dude,</v>

1873
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but he fought very brilliantly.</v>

1874
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:03.904
<v Speaker 2>But he's also,</v>

1875
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:09.190
<v Speaker 2>he's in his late thirties I think he's 37 or 38 and your body just,</v>

1876
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 2>you only have so many miles.</v>

1877
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1878
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1879
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.341
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

1880
00:48:12.341 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1881
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to change the tires.</v>

1882
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:14.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1883
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.280
<v Speaker 2>getting these upgraded suspension.</v>

1884
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.061
<v Speaker 2>He's taking some,</v>

1885
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 2>he's taking some abuse.</v>

1886
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:18.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1887
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 2>the Rockhold fight was the most abusive,</v>

1888
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.370
<v Speaker 2>never to fun.</v>

1889
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like that.</v>

1890
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jon Jones choked him out and when a guy choked you out like that,</v>

1891
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:28.360
<v Speaker 2>that's not nearly as bad.</v>

1892
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 2>A shogun Kao down essentially with one punch.</v>

1893
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 2>So those were like two big losses before.</v>

1894
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 2>But this Rockhold fight was a fucking molestation.</v>

1895
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 2>It was a brutal,</v>

1896
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:39.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1897
00:48:39.241 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't say that word.</v>

1898
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I should say it was an assault.</v>

1899
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:42.893
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

1900
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:44.423
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>

1901
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I didn't like about that fight.</v>

1902
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 2>By the end it was an assault on a helpless victim and I feel like,</v>

1903
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you were saying this too,</v>

1904
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:55.990
<v Speaker 2>that that's a fight that should have been ended probably on the stool.</v>

1905
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:56.411
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1906
00:48:56.411 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know his corner should end up well,</v>

1907
00:48:57.911 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even put his mouthpiece in for the second round.</v>

1908
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know about it.</v>

1909
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.790
<v Speaker 2>He was saying something to the referee and pointing in his mouth and I was</v>

1910
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:06.190
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what he was squaring off while they were in it.</v>

1911
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.020
<v Speaker 2>When he was on the bottom,</v>

1912
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.030
<v Speaker 2>can Rockhold was beating him up.</v>

1913
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>He pointed,</v>

1914
00:49:11.321 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 2>said to the referee something and pointed to his mouth that he didn't have a</v>

1915
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 2>mouthpiece and the referee didn't pick it up.</v>

1916
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1917
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 2>you've got to check that the corners,</v>

1918
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 2>it's their ultimately their fault,</v>

1919
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but the referee fucked up too.</v>

1920
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't let a guy fight and get the shit beat out of them with no mouthpiece</v>

1921
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:25.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1922
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1923
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 2>can we go back to that question about the conflict you feel between being a</v>

1924
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:30.484
<v Speaker 2>sports fan?</v>

1925
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of this massive fan of the sport.</v>

1926
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:33.880
<v Speaker 2>No one's a bigger fan than you.</v>

1927
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of the sport too,</v>

1928
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 2>but also that sense of,</v>

1929
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.573
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1930
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1931
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.210
<v Speaker 2>dividedness you know,</v>

1932
00:49:41.211 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1933
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:41.771
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1934
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1935
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1936
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.260
<v Speaker 2>here's how I feel about it.</v>

1937
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1938
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're trapped in this kind of devil's bargain.</v>

1939
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:48.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1940
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:50.020
<v Speaker 2>we love the sport.</v>

1941
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.860
<v Speaker 2>We admire the athletes who've been worship a movie,</v>

1942
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.801
<v Speaker 2>admire their,</v>

1943
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:54.710
<v Speaker 2>their heroism,</v>

1944
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.990
<v Speaker 2>that courage or skill,</v>

1945
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:56.531
<v Speaker 2>stamina,</v>

1946
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:57.364
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

1947
00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1948
00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 2>and we love the drama of it.</v>

1949
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.150
<v Speaker 2>We love the savagery of it.</v>

1950
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:02.740
<v Speaker 2>We love the technique of it.</v>

1951
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1952
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time we know it costs these guys too much.</v>

1953
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.920
<v Speaker 2>And I guess my question is,</v>

1954
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:10.780
<v Speaker 2>is there any way out of this devil's bargain?</v>

1955
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way that we can make these sports the sports safer than it is?</v>

1956
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1957
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:18.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1958
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I are both in agreement with the gloves issue and you wrote</v>

1959
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:23.780
<v Speaker 2>something about it and um,</v>

1960
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I discussed it with Sam Harris.</v>

1961
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I've discussed it with a bunch of people.</v>

1962
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1963
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:28.724
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1964
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 3>this would kind of be contradictory for people who don't train in martial arts,</v>

1965
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 3>but I'll try to explain it,</v>

1966
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1967
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 3>visually for people who watch this,</v>

1968
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 3>which is a much smaller percentage of the population.</v>

1969
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 3>If you look at someone's wrist,</v>

1970
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1971
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:42.651
<v Speaker 3>well your wrist,</v>

1972
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 3>when you hit things,</v>

1973
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.010
<v Speaker 3>your risk tends to wiggle around.</v>

1974
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It flexes and it,</v>

1975
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to keep your wrists stiffed and hit things hard,</v>

1976
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.700
<v Speaker 3>especially repeatedly when you're bouncing your wrist off of elbows and</v>

1977
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:56.740
<v Speaker 3>shoulders and,</v>

1978
00:50:56.890 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and even foreheads you're eating tend to break your hands much easier if you</v>

1979
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 3>don't have wraps.</v>

1980
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.150
<v Speaker 3>And when you see a fighter in the UFC,</v>

1981
00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.030
<v Speaker 3>they have those gloves on.</v>

1982
00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Those gloves aren't really protecting the other opponent,</v>

1983
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>the opponent of the person you're punching nearly as much as they're protecting</v>

1984
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 3>the per person who's punching the opponent.</v>

1985
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 3>But the big thing to me is not just the gloves,</v>

1986
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.370
<v Speaker 3>it's the raps.</v>

1987
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1988
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1989
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.410
<v Speaker 3>feel like when you tape up your wrist to cast it,</v>

1990
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1991
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.110
<v Speaker 3>You can tape up your wrist and you tape up your hands.</v>

1992
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 3>You make that thing hardest.</v>

1993
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Fuck before I work out,</v>

1994
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:29.540
<v Speaker 3>before I hit the bag or hit the pads or anything like that,</v>

1995
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I taped this fucking bitch down.</v>

1996
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I go in between my knuckles,</v>

1997
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I have uh,</v>

1998
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:35.331
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1999
00:51:35.331 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 3>these pads that I put over my knuckles and I tape over them and then I go</v>

2000
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:41.100
<v Speaker 3>everything with the athletic tape and,</v>

2001
00:51:41.101 --> 00:51:41.811
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of it,</v>

2002
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:46.100
<v Speaker 3>that fucking saying you could slam things within and it just,</v>

2003
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 3>it's unnatural.</v>

2004
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:47.963
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

2005
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.140
<v Speaker 3>you have an unnatural situation with your hands.</v>

2006
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.700
<v Speaker 3>And when people say,</v>

2007
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:53.930
<v Speaker 3>well it looks barbaric,</v>

2008
00:51:53.931 --> 00:51:54.840
<v Speaker 3>if you bare knuckle,</v>

2009
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:55.723
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something.</v>

2010
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.890
<v Speaker 3>You would be way better off with me.</v>

2011
00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Bare knuckle punching in,</v>

2012
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.080
<v Speaker 3>punching you,</v>

2013
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 3>then you would with me kicking you with my Shin.</v>

2014
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's totally legal.</v>

2015
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2016
00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>We head kicks.</v>

2017
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:11.110
<v Speaker 3>He'll like when you see like Terry Adam versus Edson Barboza and Edson Barboza,</v>

2018
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.320
<v Speaker 3>we'll kicks him in the head.</v>

2019
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2020
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.030
<v Speaker 3>There is not a fucking punch that's ever been thrown by a human being ever.</v>

2021
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.280
<v Speaker 3>That as the kind of power that a fucking wheel kick ass.</v>

2022
00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Your legs are especially not that weight class.</v>

2023
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 3>And you'd have to have like the biggest,</v>

2024
00:52:24.651 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 3>most giant heavyweight boxer and still,</v>

2025
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they could probably punch as hard as a worldclass.</v>

2026
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxer can throw a kick like that.</v>

2027
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:33.470
<v Speaker 1>It was Kickstarter rare though.</v>

2028
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:33.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2029
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:34.381
<v Speaker 1>we're very rare.</v>

2030
00:52:34.381 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that was interesting to me is there's a paper out in some,</v>

2031
00:52:37.611 --> 00:52:37.911
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2032
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 1>some journal like the Canadian Journal of Criminology,</v>

2033
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 1>not criminology and I'm sorry,</v>

2034
00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:42.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2035
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2036
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 1>sports medicine or something like that.</v>

2037
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2038
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.650
<v Speaker 1>went through all of UFC fights over like a,</v>

2039
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll say a decade.</v>

2040
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:48.363
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2041
00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and saw how they ended and when it came to Chios Kaos and Tkos,</v>

2042
00:52:53.391 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 1>85% of them were from the hands.</v>

2043
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:56.811
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2044
00:52:56.811 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 1>so my feeling is,</v>

2045
00:52:57.891 --> 00:52:58.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2046
00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:58.311
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2047
00:52:58.311 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 1>people have the wrong idea about these gloves.</v>

2048
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.790
<v Speaker 1>They really have the wrong idea.</v>

2049
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 1>They think it makes the sport safer,</v>

2050
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2051
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.590
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

2052
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think they can make it safer,</v>

2053
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.440
<v Speaker 1>safer and it does make it safer for the guys hands.</v>

2054
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And the cost of that is making an exponentially more dangerous for that other</v>

2055
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:13.574
<v Speaker 1>guy's brain.</v>

2056
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>You take those gloves off,</v>

2057
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.300
<v Speaker 1>those guys cannot throw their hands around like that.</v>

2058
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>If you glove it up,</v>

2059
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:19.363
<v Speaker 1>tape it up,</v>

2060
00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you turn that fragile,</v>

2061
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.700
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable fist.</v>

2062
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Andrew,</v>

2063
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:27.300
<v Speaker 1>a brutally dangerous cudgel and you could throw around from all these different</v>

2064
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 1>angles.</v>

2065
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 1>You can throw Roy Nelson Style overhand rights.</v>

2066
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't throw that punch with without gloves on.</v>

2067
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.893
<v Speaker 1>You break your hand.</v>

2068
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean instantly you kill yourself cause that score,</v>

2069
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 1>he punched the score with a bare hand.</v>

2070
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Speaker 1>The scope punches you back.</v>

2071
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2072
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:42.480
<v Speaker 3>If you hit someone,</v>

2073
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 3>if someone just ducks down and you hit him with a straight punch on the</v>

2074
00:53:45.571 --> 00:53:46.404
<v Speaker 3>forehead,</v>

2075
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.600
<v Speaker 3>it's like punching a wall.</v>

2076
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So to me is that there was this tragedy that happened and it happened in boxing</v>

2077
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.800
<v Speaker 1>happen in boxing in 1867,</v>

2078
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:54.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2079
00:53:54.251 --> 00:53:55.001
<v Speaker 1>boxing was on the,</v>

2080
00:53:55.001 --> 00:53:55.421
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

2081
00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:58.990
<v Speaker 1>on the verge of getting outlawed basically for being savage.</v>

2082
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.891
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

2083
00:53:59.891 --> 00:54:00.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2084
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.030
<v Speaker 1>we'll change the rules,</v>

2085
00:54:01.031 --> 00:54:05.140
<v Speaker 1>we'll add these different elements would make it possible for referees to stop</v>

2086
00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:07.600
<v Speaker 1>fight and we'll put pillows on the guys first.</v>

2087
00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So it was a well intended thing.</v>

2088
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.650
<v Speaker 1>The well-intended thing,</v>

2089
00:54:11.651 --> 00:54:13.210
<v Speaker 1>we were well intended,</v>

2090
00:54:13.211 --> 00:54:14.350
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian gesture,</v>

2091
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:18.820
<v Speaker 1>we'll make this the sport face safer by put in these pills on these guys' hands.</v>

2092
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.800
<v Speaker 1>And the UFC made exactly the same mistake a 130 years later or something.</v>

2093
00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2094
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.890
<v Speaker 1>they were on the verge of getting outlawed.</v>

2095
00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.500
<v Speaker 1>They were having all kinds of political problems.</v>

2096
00:54:29.501 --> 00:54:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And so they reformed.</v>

2097
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:30.911
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2098
00:54:30.911 --> 00:54:31.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2099
00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:31.220
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

2100
00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:36.220
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna outlaw these really brutal looking techniques and we are also going</v>

2101
00:54:36.431 --> 00:54:40.990
<v Speaker 1>to take away the prime symbol in the public's mind of the savagery of cage</v>

2102
00:54:40.991 --> 00:54:41.380
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

2103
00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.880
<v Speaker 1>which is bare fisted fighting.</v>

2104
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.930
<v Speaker 1>It's even in our language when we say we're going to take the gloves off,</v>

2105
00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:47.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2106
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.130
<v Speaker 1>That means we're gonna resort to a really primitive style of brutality.</v>

2107
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2108
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:52.870
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2109
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:53.703
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2110
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:54.761
<v Speaker 1>so it was just,</v>

2111
00:54:54.761 --> 00:54:58.420
<v Speaker 1>it was a well-intended gesture that backfired in a tragic way.</v>

2112
00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:00.910
<v Speaker 1>So people think that the,</v>

2113
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.690
<v Speaker 1>the sort of savagery and the damage and the danger,</v>

2114
00:55:04.691 --> 00:55:05.920
<v Speaker 1>the neurological danger,</v>

2115
00:55:05.921 --> 00:55:10.660
<v Speaker 1>especially of fighting is intrinsic to the sport and unavoidable.</v>

2116
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's not really true.</v>

2117
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 1>You could massively decrease the,</v>

2118
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:18.820
<v Speaker 1>the danger of the neurological danger of the sport just by taking off the</v>

2119
00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:19.654
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

2120
00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.261
<v Speaker 3>Could you,</v>

2121
00:55:20.261 --> 00:55:23.440
<v Speaker 3>because a big percentage of the blows that guys received,</v>

2122
00:55:23.441 --> 00:55:26.710
<v Speaker 3>they're receiving training and you're very unlikely to train bare knuckle,</v>

2123
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.500
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to steal.</v>

2124
00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.790
<v Speaker 3>You could still get tagged.</v>

2125
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:31.683
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2126
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:32.793
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2127
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 3>There's also a,</v>

2128
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:37.030
<v Speaker 3>an in paeds grappling in a lot of ways.</v>

2129
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:37.630
<v Speaker 3>The gloves did.</v>

2130
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2131
00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.101
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2132
00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2133
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.480
<v Speaker 3>They get in the way of a lot of chokes.</v>

2134
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2135
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:44.570
<v Speaker 3>they get in the way their handles and you can't get the men,</v>

2136
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:46.630
<v Speaker 3>you close your neck up,</v>

2137
00:55:46.631 --> 00:55:47.464
<v Speaker 3>you can't get your gloves.</v>

2138
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Some guys use them intelligently to actually finish chokes.</v>

2139
00:55:50.921 --> 00:55:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I've seen Josh Thompson,</v>

2140
00:55:52.121 --> 00:55:53.470
<v Speaker 3>who's a very clever fellow.</v>

2141
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:54.730
<v Speaker 3>He's uh,</v>

2142
00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:59.730
<v Speaker 3>done rear naked chokes where he reaches under his own gloves and chokes guys and</v>

2143
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.730
<v Speaker 3>foundation foundations that it's quite sure,</v>

2144
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:03.920
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure.</v>

2145
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I can't reach inside the other guys' glove.</v>

2146
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:07.810
<v Speaker 3>You can't reach inside the other gods glove.</v>

2147
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I think you can grab your own glove that you can grab your shorts,</v>

2148
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.550
<v Speaker 3>you can grab your shorts to defend yourself.</v>

2149
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.100
<v Speaker 3>You can't grab your shorts to finish a technique done.</v>

2150
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:16.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2151
00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I think if you had like there is a position that you could get where you could</v>

2152
00:56:20.471 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 3>have your arm wrapped around the guy's neck and grab own shorts.</v>

2153
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2154
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:24.801
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2155
00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 2>and use your own shorts to aid in the choke.</v>

2156
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm wonder if you could do that.</v>

2157
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you could do it on offense.</v>

2158
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I probably should know this as soon as I do it for living.</v>

2159
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:33.701
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2160
00:56:33.701 --> 00:56:33.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2161
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I know that you can use it defensively,</v>

2162
00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 2>which is big with Kimora.</v>

2163
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2164
00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 2>If a guy is going for a shoulder lock and you've reached deep into your shorts</v>

2165
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:42.574
<v Speaker 2>and you hold onto them,</v>

2166
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it could be just enough to protect you to keep you from forgetting tapped yet.</v>

2167
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2168
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:48.641
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

2169
00:56:48.641 --> 00:56:48.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2170
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:48.950
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2171
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:49.541
<v Speaker 2>if you take the,</v>

2172
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 2>if you take the gloves off to,</v>

2173
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:51.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2174
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I've already with some people about this,</v>

2175
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:53.200
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2176
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:53.351
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2177
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:55.990
<v Speaker 2>if you did that and guys would just throw more so more kicks,</v>

2178
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:56.681
<v Speaker 2>they throw more needs,</v>

2179
00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:57.280
<v Speaker 2>they throw Morrell,</v>

2180
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:57.970
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

2181
00:56:57.970 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a little more like bare knuckle Moyie Thai.</v>

2182
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2183
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:00.821
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

2184
00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:01.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2185
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I think paradoxically taken the gloves off would also,</v>

2186
00:57:04.331 --> 00:57:07.540
<v Speaker 2>we can all the other weapons because it's really hard to kick somebody in the</v>

2187
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 2>head lot if you're Donald's Serone well,</v>

2188
00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2189
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 2>but partly it's because they have to respect as fis and had a lot of respect for</v>

2190
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:14.914
<v Speaker 2>his fists.</v>

2191
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2192
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:16.960
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like you get close to him,</v>

2193
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you get need like you get elbowed.</v>

2194
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:20.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2195
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I I see,</v>

2196
00:57:21.251 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I kind of disagree with that cause I think it really just depends upon what kind</v>

2197
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:26.800
<v Speaker 2>of skillset you get into MMA with.</v>

2198
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>If you get a guy who was a really good kicker and you take away the gloves,</v>

2199
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you just made his kicks better.</v>

2200
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.491
<v Speaker 2>He does now.</v>

2201
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:36.280
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have to worry nearly as much as that's true.</v>

2202
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

2203
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking it,</v>

2204
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.303
<v Speaker 2>the other guy,</v>

2205
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:39.191
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2206
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 2>the defender wouldn't be as vulnerable to the kick because he doesn't,</v>

2207
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.240
<v Speaker 2>he can,</v>

2208
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 2>he can look for the kick more cause he didn't have to be aware of the other guys</v>

2209
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:47.380
<v Speaker 2>fist.</v>

2210
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:47.711
<v Speaker 2>But you're right,</v>

2211
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 2>the kicker doesn't have to worry about it.</v>

2212
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:49.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2213
00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:50.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

2214
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And one of the biggest problems with the gloves is the fact that the fingers are</v>

2215
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 2>wide open and guys are poking each other in the eye all the time.</v>

2216
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge issue.</v>

2217
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.750
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has tried to figure out a way to do it to,</v>

2218
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:02.441
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate it,</v>

2219
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:05.830
<v Speaker 2>to have the same gloves but make something where they curve more.</v>

2220
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I think Bella tour came out with his Everlast glove that I think has two,</v>

2221
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2222
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 2>two opposing benefits.</v>

2223
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Like it's more curved,</v>

2224
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 2>which I think is better to avoid some of the posts like the old pride gloves.</v>

2225
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2226
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
<v Speaker 2>But also it's got more padding on the top to protect the knuckles so they have</v>

2227
00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 2>less broken hands.</v>

2228
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 2>But that means to me that guys can punch harder.</v>

2229
00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you can,</v>

2230
00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 2>you're more free to punch,</v>

2231
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 2>but you're less lucky to poke.</v>

2232
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I will take that.</v>

2233
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the less likely to get the iPods because I think the I pokes or of,</v>

2234
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:43.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge tragic issue for people who aren't familiar with the sport.</v>

2235
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Muay Thai,</v>

2236
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.050
<v Speaker 2>the art of Thai boxing.</v>

2237
00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2238
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:48.220
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2239
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:52.990
<v Speaker 2>they have a very specific style of using the hands.</v>

2240
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:53.411
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2241
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 2>they'll like put the hands on the forehead and they'll throw knees,</v>

2242
00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.140
<v Speaker 2>they'll put the hands up and they'll throw kicks.</v>

2243
00:58:59.141 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 2>They'll put the hand dug.</v>

2244
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:01.210
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot,</v>

2245
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.070
<v Speaker 2>especially in different practitioners.</v>

2246
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.040
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of ways of using,</v>

2247
00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.330
<v Speaker 2>but when they're doing it in the gym or in the ring,</v>

2248
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 2>they're usually wearing big boxing gloves and the boxing gloves don't have</v>

2249
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 2>anything free to poke.</v>

2250
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.710
<v Speaker 2>But fingers in MMA gloves,</v>

2251
00:59:14.711 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 2>the fingers are completely exposed.</v>

2252
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 2>And when guys utilize the same techniques,</v>

2253
00:59:18.311 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>try to keep a guy off them.</v>

2254
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2255
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 2>they oftentimes up poking guys</v>

2256
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 3>right in the eyes and they cause irreparable damage.</v>

2257
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Like guys like Alan Belcher,</v>

2258
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 3>he's been out of the UFC for a long time.</v>

2259
00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:29.990
<v Speaker 3>He had knee surgery,</v>

2260
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:31.220
<v Speaker 3>like significant eye surgery.</v>

2261
00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisping had significant eye surgery.</v>

2262
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:34.870
<v Speaker 3>He has oil in his eye.</v>

2263
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.713
<v Speaker 3>This thing does,</v>

2264
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.310
<v Speaker 3>you look at one of his eyes,</v>

2265
00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 3>he was different color.</v>

2266
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't see his pupil.</v>

2267
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.660
<v Speaker 3>It's to protect his retina.</v>

2268
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.613
<v Speaker 3>Yikes.</v>

2269
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 3>But he's such a fucking gangster.</v>

2270
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:44.721
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

2271
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:45.161
<v Speaker 3>he's dealing,</v>

2272
00:59:45.161 --> 00:59:46.500
<v Speaker 3>they're thrown down with one bomb.</v>

2273
00:59:46.501 --> 00:59:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I think again though,</v>

2274
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 3>like when through these guys quit.</v>

2275
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2276
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:53.120
<v Speaker 3>he still worldclass clearly,</v>

2277
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean he still,</v>

2279
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:55.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2280
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:55.671
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

2281
00:59:55.671 --> 00:59:56.504
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2282
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 3>beat CB away and uh,</v>

2283
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.310
<v Speaker 3>he showed he's still worldclass.</v>

2284
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.180
<v Speaker 3>He's still one of the best guys in the world.</v>

2285
01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:03.200
<v Speaker 3>The [inaudible] victory.</v>

2286
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:03.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2287
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:04.820
<v Speaker 3>that guy has a chair.</v>

2288
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2289
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.530
<v Speaker 3>he really does have a chance till he really has a dream and that dream is to be</v>

2290
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:10.130
<v Speaker 3>a world champion.</v>

2291
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:14.750
<v Speaker 3>And that mindset that he has that allows him to fight with one fucked up by,</v>

2292
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2293
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 3>throughout,</v>

2294
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.610
<v Speaker 3>and he has got something wrong with his neck man.</v>

2295
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 3>He's always like banged up and he's been fighting forever.</v>

2296
01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:25.040
<v Speaker 3>He's also been fighting clean and a lot of his major losses are from guys who</v>

2297
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 3>weren't clean,</v>

2298
01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 3>even if they weren't legally clean.</v>

2299
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:28.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2300
01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 3>even if what they were doing was legal,</v>

2301
01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:31.140
<v Speaker 3>like Henderson and v tour,</v>

2302
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 3>there's still weren't clean,</v>

2303
01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 3>clean.</v>

2304
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Chael Sonnen wasn't clean.</v>

2305
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean all these guys were not clean them.</v>

2306
01:00:36.771 --> 01:00:36.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2307
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody who beat him except Rockhold Rockhold is just a fucking freak</v>

2309
01:00:41.241 --> 01:00:42.074
<v Speaker 3>of nature.</v>

2310
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Freak of nature and a freak of training with Cain Velasquez and Daniel Cormier</v>

2312
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.390
<v Speaker 3>every fucking day,</v>

2313
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2314
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:50.960
<v Speaker 3>he's just so God damn good and long and strong,</v>

2315
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe are big and strong.</v>

2316
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:53.530
<v Speaker 3>He was watered.</v>

2317
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Machida,</v>

2318
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you know Javier Mendez was,</v>

2319
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.990
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about it after the fight.</v>

2320
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.261
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2321
01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:57.921
<v Speaker 3>God damn.</v>

2322
01:00:57.921 --> 01:00:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I was congratulating them.</v>

2323
01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.121
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2324
01:00:59.121 --> 01:00:59.954
<v Speaker 3>that was insane.</v>

2325
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.471
<v Speaker 3>And they'll like,</v>

2326
01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you know what people don't realize about him.</v>

2327
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:02.141
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2328
01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:03.500
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking strong.</v>

2329
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:07.550
<v Speaker 3>And it's very rare that you get someone who's real long but also really strong.</v>

2330
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck he ways when he actually gets in there,</v>

2331
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.350
<v Speaker 3>but it ain't one 85 he looked young dude.</v>

2332
01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:15.111
<v Speaker 3>He dwarfs me.</v>

2333
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I weighed 200 pounds and I mean,</v>

2334
01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:17.104
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm fat,</v>

2335
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.410
<v Speaker 3>but when I stand next to him I'm like,</v>

2336
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:19.370
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here.</v>

2337
01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:19.791
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>

2338
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:24.650
<v Speaker 3>One 85 he's six foot four and he looks like he's about to 20 when he gets into</v>

2339
01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:25.041
<v Speaker 3>the cage.</v>

2340
01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:25.874
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

2341
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:27.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he makes that wait.</v>

2342
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:27.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2343
01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't either.</v>

2344
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't have no idea how he makes that fucking weight.</v>

2345
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.390
<v Speaker 3>But he does it.</v>

2346
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 3>He does it and he can fight hard,</v>

2347
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2348
01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.870
<v Speaker 3>with the gloves because it's talking about ways of making the sport safer.</v>

2349
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:36.110
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2350
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:36.943
<v Speaker 3>that's another one.</v>

2351
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2352
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:37.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2353
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:38.001
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2354
01:01:38.001 --> 01:01:39.470
<v Speaker 3>the weight cutting issue is big.</v>

2355
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.670
<v Speaker 3>How do you stop that?</v>

2356
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:42.740
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to stop probably,</v>

2357
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2358
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 3>to me like the first guy to die and the UFC is just as likely to die in the</v>

2359
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 3>sauna.</v>

2360
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.551
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2361
01:01:49.551 --> 01:01:50.600
<v Speaker 3>it's come very close.</v>

2362
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.090
<v Speaker 3>There's been a few guys backstage that fainted.</v>

2363
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.510
<v Speaker 3>They blacked out and they put pulled out of fights because they couldn't.</v>

2364
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2365
01:01:56.871 --> 01:01:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Hanan Barao was a big one.</v>

2366
01:01:58.011 --> 01:02:01.100
<v Speaker 3>That was a big one because a rematch with Tj Dillashaw.</v>

2367
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 3>The fight was one of the fights of the year.</v>

2368
01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.530
<v Speaker 3>One of the upsets of the,</v>

2369
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.140
<v Speaker 3>the entire history of the UFC.</v>

2370
01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:07.130
<v Speaker 3>One of the biggest upsets,</v>

2371
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 3>a spectacular performance by Tj Dillashaw Hanan Barao trains like a monster</v>

2372
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:16.571
<v Speaker 3>ready for this comeback and then fall passes out in the sauna or the bath</v>

2373
01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:16.941
<v Speaker 3>bathtub,</v>

2374
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:17.271
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

2375
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:20.120
<v Speaker 3>and cracked his head off the wall and they wouldn't let them find</v>

2376
01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:20.231
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2377
01:02:20.231 --> 01:02:22.380
<v Speaker 2>He knocked himself out trying to get up out of the tub.</v>

2378
01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2379
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.090
<v Speaker 2>I felt like that and yoga today,</v>

2380
01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2381
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was going to black out because you really now,</v>

2382
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.051
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2383
01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's like an elevator everybody.</v>

2384
01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:30.903
<v Speaker 2>The heads house.</v>

2385
01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like I'm going to pass out on the headstand.</v>

2387
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I've felt like I've realized what a bitch I am.</v>

2388
01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:38.870
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2389
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm like grabbing my toes.</v>

2390
01:02:40.471 --> 01:02:40.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2391
01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:40.951
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2392
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:41.491
<v Speaker 2>I need a break.</v>

2393
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.324
<v Speaker 2>It's too hot in here.</v>

2394
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking about like what these guys have to do in the fucking sauna to drop</v>

2395
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.940
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds of water weight and that they do it every three or four months.</v>

2396
01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2397
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

2398
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.473
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2399
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I only had one actual fight.</v>

2400
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2401
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:55.850
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2402
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>but I cut white twice because the first fight I,</v>

2403
01:02:58.201 --> 01:02:58.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2404
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I showed up to and my opponent fearing the legendary fisted prowess of English</v>

2405
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:04.704
<v Speaker 2>professors.</v>

2406
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.983
<v Speaker 2>He backed out.</v>

2407
01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:08.410
<v Speaker 2>He backed out the day of,</v>

2408
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.800
<v Speaker 2>I got on the scale and everything.</v>

2409
01:03:10.801 --> 01:03:11.341
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking around,</v>

2410
01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 2>my guy's not there and you know,</v>

2411
01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2412
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:13.441
<v Speaker 2>I was scared.</v>

2413
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:13.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2414
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2415
01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:13.991
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2416
01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 2>it's nerve racking to fight,</v>

2417
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 2>but after you've gone through the weight cut,</v>

2418
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:17.641
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2419
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to not find what was wrong with him.</v>

2420
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.161
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't show up.</v>

2421
01:03:23.161 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 2>You're not small time amateur shows and a lot of guys and say,</v>

2422
01:03:26.191 --> 01:03:26.371
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2423
01:03:26.371 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>

2424
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 2>this seems like a good idea a couple of months ago,</v>

2425
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.620
<v Speaker 2>but you know as it got close,</v>

2426
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:32.454
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't hurt or anything.</v>

2427
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Just we had a guy from our gym that would have panic attacks and there was a</v>

2428
01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Speaker 2>couple of fights,</v>

2429
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 2>one fight where you almost couldn't,</v>

2430
01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.530
<v Speaker 2>he almost couldn't do it.</v>

2431
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Like he was just falling apart backstage and went up there and did it,</v>

2432
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:44.251
<v Speaker 2>but he lost,</v>

2433
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 2>he got beat up pretty bad.</v>

2434
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 2>But then another fight where he just pulled out backstage day of the fight,</v>

2435
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.753
<v Speaker 2>getting prepped,</v>

2436
01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>warming up,</v>

2437
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.570
<v Speaker 2>wrapping the hands the whole day.</v>

2438
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't do fucking here to do this.</v>

2439
01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:54.740
<v Speaker 2>How really,</v>

2440
01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 2>you know it happens at the UFC.</v>

2441
01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.980
<v Speaker 2>It happens at the UFC and people don't know.</v>

2442
01:03:59.160 --> 01:03:59.461
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2443
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:03.060
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that wind up fighting and there's guys that are pretty highly</v>

2444
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:03.890
<v Speaker 2>ranked.</v>

2445
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to name any names,</v>

2446
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.660
<v Speaker 2>but Shaw,</v>

2447
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Schaub and I were actually having a conversation about this the other</v>

2448
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 2>day about guys that were warming up while he was back there.</v>

2449
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:13.381
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2450
01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2451
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 2>they would say to their coach,</v>

2452
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fucking do this anymore.</v>

2453
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

2454
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

2455
01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

2456
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.140
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2457
01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 2>you got to fight in an hour.</v>

2458
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 2>But then they go out and they go out.</v>

2459
01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2461
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2462
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:23.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2463
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2464
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.301
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2465
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing to me because it's,</v>

2466
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:26.540
<v Speaker 2>there's such,</v>

2467
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2468
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason I fought finally was because of the social pressure.</v>

2469
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Like once you started off down this path,</v>

2470
01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2471
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>it becomes like this thing where like you've told people you're going to do it</v>

2472
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 2>and everybody that Jim knows you're going to do it.</v>

2473
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:40.291
<v Speaker 2>And so one time I tried it,</v>

2474
01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I kind of tried to back out,</v>

2475
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:42.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2476
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>like months before my actual fight,</v>

2477
01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:44.581
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2478
01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:44.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2479
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:45.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2480
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 2>other writers have done this and you know,</v>

2481
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:47.364
<v Speaker 2>I'm all her,</v>

2482
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.990
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to do it.</v>

2483
01:04:48.991 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>And I went in and told one of the guys at the gym that I was kind of leaning</v>

2484
01:04:51.331 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 2>away from doing and he's like,</v>

2485
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:52.921
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2486
01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:53.071
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2487
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:53.290
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2488
01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 2>so you're posting it now,</v>

2489
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.953
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2490
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:55.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2491
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:56.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2492
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.360
<v Speaker 2>and then I told another guy,</v>

2493
01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2494
01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2495
01:04:58.090 --> 01:04:58.850
<v Speaker 2>see your pussy now.</v>

2496
01:04:58.850 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

2497
01:04:59.610 --> 01:04:59.851
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2498
01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>so everybody's kind of said that and it becomes this huge pressure,</v>

2499
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.340
<v Speaker 2>like to do it.</v>

2500
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2501
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:07.590
<v Speaker 2>and I felt like this,</v>

2502
01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2503
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I felt more fear of failure and courage than I did of the sort of whatever was</v>

2504
01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 2>going to happen to me in the cage,</v>

2505
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:16.883
<v Speaker 2>breaking my nose,</v>

2506
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.621
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2507
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I felt much</v>

2508
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>more fear that I would just find a way to chicken out in the end.</v>

2509
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>

2510
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I'd get cold feet.</v>

2511
01:05:22.531 --> 01:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd refuse to climb the steps and get in the cage.</v>

2512
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd run for it in the cage.</v>

2513
01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Just sprint in circles around the outside,</v>

2514
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>jumped over the fence,</v>

2515
01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:31.144
<v Speaker 1>run for home.</v>

2516
01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2517
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I honestly thought that could happen,</v>

2518
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:33.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2519
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.390
<v Speaker 1>so I can,</v>

2520
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.553
<v Speaker 1>so I can relate.</v>

2521
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of amazing that they got backed out backstage because there's so much</v>

2522
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.021
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>

2523
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:41.854
<v Speaker 1>Your whole,</v>

2524
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>the whole warrior society sees you doing it,</v>

2525
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:46.143
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2526
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>The big blow.</v>

2527
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2528
01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:49.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2529
01:05:49.681 --> 01:05:52.650
<v Speaker 3>sometimes guys are injured and then they get there and they realize like,</v>

2530
01:05:52.651 --> 01:05:53.350
<v Speaker 3>I can't fuck,</v>

2531
01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>

2532
01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.630
<v Speaker 3>I can't move my leg.</v>

2533
01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2534
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.970
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys who fight.</v>

2536
01:05:56.971 --> 01:05:57.804
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing.</v>

2537
01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.720
<v Speaker 3>The guys would fight in the UFC that are fucked up.</v>

2538
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.610
<v Speaker 3>They're really injured by the time they get in there.</v>

2539
01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I know guys who have hid a torn ACL tear.</v>

2540
01:06:06.511 --> 01:06:07.101
<v Speaker 3>Their ACL is,</v>

2541
01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:10.530
<v Speaker 3>we're completely blown out and they really had no stability.</v>

2542
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:11.311
<v Speaker 3>Like they would,</v>

2543
01:06:11.311 --> 01:06:11.551
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2544
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.190
<v Speaker 3>they would try to move one way or another and then knee would just give right</v>

2545
01:06:14.191 --> 01:06:14.850
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2546
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:16.620
<v Speaker 3>And there's a mean,</v>

2547
01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:20.760
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be nothing more terrifying than being in the octagon and competing</v>

2548
01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:23.070
<v Speaker 3>against some highly trained,</v>

2549
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.530
<v Speaker 3>well prepared killer.</v>

2550
01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:26.730
<v Speaker 3>And you can't even move right?</v>

2551
01:06:26.731 --> 01:06:27.181
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

2552
01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:28.560
<v Speaker 3>if you juke left or right,</v>

2553
01:06:28.561 --> 01:06:31.680
<v Speaker 3>your legs going to go boink if you blown out a knee before,</v>

2554
01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:32.240
<v Speaker 3>do you know that?</v>

2555
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:32.381
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2556
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:33.214
<v Speaker 3>I've never done that.</v>

2557
01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:34.950
<v Speaker 3>It's still at worst.</v>

2558
01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not the worst.</v>

2559
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Worst is there's obviously way worse,</v>

2560
01:06:37.681 --> 01:06:38.710
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2561
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:42.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad feeling because you just know it's going to give out.</v>

2562
01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 3>You don't know when and you go to move left or move.</v>

2563
01:06:44.911 --> 01:06:45.121
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2564
01:06:45.121 --> 01:06:46.500
<v Speaker 3>And it just goes boing.</v>

2565
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.920
<v Speaker 3>And ACL is a spare apparent,</v>

2566
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2567
01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:50.970
<v Speaker 3>particularly rather because a,</v>

2568
01:06:50.971 --> 01:06:54.840
<v Speaker 3>that's the big one that goes down the center of the knee that keeps it stable</v>

2569
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.460
<v Speaker 3>moving forward and it,</v>

2570
01:06:56.461 --> 01:06:56.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2571
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.430
<v Speaker 3>it can blow out on a lot of people that blows out.</v>

2572
01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:01.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the more common knee injuries.</v>

2573
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Dominick Cruz of course is famously going through his second one.</v>

2574
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Is third a third operation?</v>

2575
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 3>A second knee though.</v>

2576
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking crazy.</v>

2577
01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.690
<v Speaker 3>That's awful.</v>

2578
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2579
01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:14.040
<v Speaker 3>It's real common though.</v>

2580
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:15.810
<v Speaker 3>George Saint Pierre got both his knees done.</v>

2581
01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:20.070
<v Speaker 3>One of them blew out after his career was over or after he stepped down for a</v>

2582
01:07:20.071 --> 01:07:20.904
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

2583
01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2584
01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.280

<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] has had her ACL done.</v>

2586
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Lot of fighters have other ACL done.</v>

2587
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:32.630
<v Speaker 3>It's probably one of the most common injuries that a fighters have in UFC.</v>

2588
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:34.261
<v Speaker 3>Any sport,</v>

2589
01:07:34.261 --> 01:07:34.561
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

2590
01:07:34.561 --> 01:07:35.101
<v Speaker 3>Acl,</v>

2591
01:07:35.101 --> 01:07:36.630
<v Speaker 3>it seems soccer.</v>

2592
01:07:36.631 --> 01:07:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's the most common football at time.</v>

2593
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Beth football at the time,</v>

2594
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.440
<v Speaker 3>you have the human bodies just fucking,</v>

2595
01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:48.240
<v Speaker 3>it's designed to get you to like age 26 and by the end you're almost dead.</v>

2596
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2597
01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Saber Tooth Tigers are looking for you to show up limping.</v>

2598
01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.713
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2599
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just shit design man.</v>

2600
01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2601
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a shit design for playing NFL football for a punching people in the</v>

2602
01:07:58.271 --> 01:08:01.210
<v Speaker 1>head is a shit shit design for fighting for a living.</v>

2603
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:01.721
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2604
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:02.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2606
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:04.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not made for that.</v>

2607
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2608
01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:05.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2609
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:06.190
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2610
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2611
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit much.</v>

2612
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2613
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:10.810
<v Speaker 3>when you see an NFL player and a,</v>

2614
01:08:10.811 --> 01:08:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I've only met a few of them,</v>

2615
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 3>but when you meet them it's like fucking,</v>

2616
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.500
<v Speaker 3>they were like giants from game of Thrones.</v>

2617
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a real person.</v>

2618
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

2619
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time I was in Phoenix and uh,</v>

2620
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.401
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2621
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:22.900
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

2622
01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2623
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 2>just got done with the show.</v>

2624
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 2>We did a comedy show at the Tempe Improv and then we went to a bar and when we</v>

2625
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:30.291
<v Speaker 2>went to a bar,</v>

2626
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 2>there was this big line of people that we're trying to get to this place.</v>

2627
01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:38.120
<v Speaker 2>We're meeting our friend there and one of these guys was an NFL player and he</v>

2628
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:38.550
<v Speaker 2>just sort,</v>

2629
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>it was like a man amongst children whose just like moving through this crowd.</v>

2630
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:48.011
<v Speaker 2>He was about six foot seven and he was probably 350 pounds and he was so fucking</v>

2631
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:49.581
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

2632
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:51.920
<v Speaker 2>And like you looked at him and just go where you feel like a girl.</v>

2633
01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like a girl?</v>

2634
01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

2635
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend like that,</v>

2636
01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:55.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2637
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 2>if he'd played a big time college football and you're six,</v>

2638
01:08:57.861 --> 01:08:59.540
<v Speaker 2>seven 200 high,</v>

2639
01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>two hundreds and I'd stand up with them at the bar and it was like,</v>

2640
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:04.460
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be looking at his tits,</v>

2641
01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2642
01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:05.900
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be like,</v>

2643
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>this is how you had talked to him.</v>

2644
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:07.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2645
01:09:07.431 --> 01:09:08.810
<v Speaker 2>this is what it feels like for women.</v>

2646
01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2647
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.041
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

2648
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:12.680
<v Speaker 2>They're looking up over this guy that can just do this,</v>

2649
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 2>except they get turned on by them and they want to fuck them.</v>

2650
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.770
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2651
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:16.431
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

2652
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I hope you didn't get turned out well.</v>

2653
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:17.851
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2654
01:09:17.851 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 2>If you did,</v>

2655
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.110
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2656
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.943
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2657
01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2658
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's more of a worrisome,</v>

2659
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:25.670
<v Speaker 2>like is he going to try to fuck me because I hope it doesn't cause I'll have no</v>

2660
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:26.210
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

2661
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:26.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2662
01:09:26.451 --> 01:09:27.170
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

2663
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 2>there's no equality when it comes to physical attributes.</v>

2664
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.950
<v Speaker 2>There's certain people that were just given a way better genetic roll the dice</v>

2665
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.820
<v Speaker 2>when it comes.</v>

2666
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:35.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2667
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have weight classes.</v>

2668
01:09:36.201 --> 01:09:41.201
<v Speaker 2>It's why mighty mouse can never fight Jon Jones is now the argument can take</v>

2669
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:41.521
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2670
01:09:41.521 --> 01:09:43.820
<v Speaker 2>So as to who's better pound for pound?</v>

2671
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.970
<v Speaker 2>John are mighty mouse and there's a lot of arguments both ways,</v>

2672
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:49.130
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like what would happen if they fight,</v>

2673
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 2>there's no argument.</v>

2674
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

2675
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:51.470
<v Speaker 2>no argument at all.</v>

2676
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.333
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2677
01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones is a talented enough where he probably could fight and beat most of</v>

2678
01:09:56.661 --> 01:09:57.201
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweights,</v>

2679
01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:58.460
<v Speaker 2>if not all the heavyweights.</v>

2680
01:09:58.461 --> 01:09:59.294
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

2681
01:09:59.300 --> 01:09:59.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2682
01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2683
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2684
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing with him is so tragic.</v>

2685
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.230
<v Speaker 2>It's so tragic and you know,</v>

2686
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.430
<v Speaker 2>more tragic for the woman he hit with his car.</v>

2687
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.390
<v Speaker 2>But so tragic for him because you know,</v>

2688
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him well enough to know like where his mind's at or who he's</v>

2689
01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:15.060
<v Speaker 2>talking to and you,</v>

2690
01:10:15.061 --> 01:10:18.740
<v Speaker 2>you hear all these bad things like the people that he's hanging out with and the</v>

2691
01:10:18.741 --> 01:10:19.980
<v Speaker 2>people that he surrounds himself with.</v>

2692
01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:20.271
<v Speaker 2>You here,</v>

2693
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 2>some of them from his coaches.</v>

2694
01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:23.690
<v Speaker 2>So there's gotta be some village and truth to it.</v>

2695
01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 2>But for every guy like that,</v>

2696
01:10:26.331 --> 01:10:28.340
<v Speaker 2>that's super fucking talented,</v>

2697
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.640
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's so hard to stay on track.</v>

2698
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like Mike Tyson had custom motto,</v>

2699
01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:35.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2700
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.360
<v Speaker 2>and custom motto was not just a great trainer,</v>

2701
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:41.210
<v Speaker 2>but it was also a great mental coach.</v>

2702
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Like he had instilled lessons in Mike Tyson about fire and fear and all the,</v>

2703
01:10:46.831 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 2>all the different aspects of competition that are going to arise and how the</v>

2704
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:53.390
<v Speaker 2>hero and the coward feel the same thing.</v>

2705
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just the hero reacts to it differently.</v>

2706
01:10:55.491 --> 01:10:58.550
<v Speaker 2>And then just the more you prepare your body,</v>

2707
01:10:58.940 --> 01:10:59.773
<v Speaker 2>the less,</v>

2708
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:00.763
<v Speaker 2>the less,</v>

2709
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:01.701
<v Speaker 2>not fear,</v>

2710
01:11:01.701 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 2>but the less confusion you have when you get into that ring,</v>

2711
01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>the less doubt you have,</v>

2712
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.670
<v Speaker 2>the less,</v>

2713
01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:09.050
<v Speaker 2>the more clarity you have.</v>

2714
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:12.410
<v Speaker 2>You're 100% confident and you're conditioning your 100% confident in your</v>

2715
01:11:12.411 --> 01:11:13.140
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

2716
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>There will be certain</v>

2717
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>fear but you can mitigate some of that.</v>

2718
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 3>And all this was custom model just was a genius with Tyson plus he was like a</v>

2719
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:21.751
<v Speaker 3>father figure.</v>

2720
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:22.860
<v Speaker 3>It was like a perfect example.</v>

2721
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:24.210
<v Speaker 3>But Jon Jones had a father,</v>

2722
01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:25.840
<v Speaker 3>the father middle class.</v>

2723
01:11:25.841 --> 01:11:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I've still does.</v>

2724
01:11:26.691 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>You know he still does,</v>

2725
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is a coach you need,</v>

2726
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:33.900
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that just in a father.</v>

2727
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean his father,</v>

2728
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:36.920
<v Speaker 3>does he have that out in Albuquerque with,</v>

2729
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>

2730
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.453
<v Speaker 3>Jackson?</v>

2731
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.990
<v Speaker 3>I think he does to a certain extent,</v>

2732
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.870
<v Speaker 3>but Jon Jones is so fucking good.</v>

2733
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 3>The guys who trained with him,</v>

2734
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:45.161
<v Speaker 3>the guys who talk,</v>

2735
01:11:45.161 --> 01:11:46.410
<v Speaker 3>like if you talk to people you'll like,</v>

2736
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>he's so good.</v>

2737
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 3>He's so much better than everybody else in the gym.</v>

2738
01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:51.390
<v Speaker 3>He's so much better than it.</v>

2739
01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2740
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 3>when you saw him grab a hold of Daniel Cormier and wrestle Carme 80 the ground,</v>

2741
01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:55.464
<v Speaker 3>the first round,</v>

2742
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.921
<v Speaker 3>he'll like,</v>

2743
01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:56.370
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2744
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 3>this is another fucking level shit you're dealing with.</v>

2745
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with like another level of greatness.</v>

2746
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Another level of ability and when you,</v>

2747
01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:05.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2748
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:09.300
<v Speaker 3>you see a guy like that get involved and I mean the cocaine thing,</v>

2749
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:09.491
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2750
01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:10.710
<v Speaker 3>that didn't bother me that much.</v>

2751
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:12.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's always doing coke.</v>

2752
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:12.961
<v Speaker 3>Three weeks out.</v>

2753
01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2754
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:14.634
<v Speaker 3>He wants a party,</v>

2755
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.181
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2756
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:16.080
<v Speaker 3>That's how I look at it.</v>

2757
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:16.411
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

2758
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm not,</v>

2759
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2760
01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:17.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2761
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at this as like,</v>

2762
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:19.501
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2763
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.141
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any cure.</v>

2764
01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:21.200
<v Speaker 3>A 10 don't know me.</v>

2765
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:21.811
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2766
01:12:21.811 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2767
01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.621
<v Speaker 3>let's have fun.</v>

2768
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:24.270
<v Speaker 3>What would I get upset if he had a drink?</v>

2769
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Three you know,</v>

2770
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:25.950
<v Speaker 3>three months out.</v>

2771
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:26.311
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2772
01:12:26.311 --> 01:12:26.611
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2773
01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:27.670
<v Speaker 3>or three weeks out or whether,</v>

2774
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 3>how many weeks was it?</v>

2775
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:30.770
<v Speaker 3>How many weeks was it before the fight about that?</v>

2776
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 3>It sounds right.</v>

2777
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:31.891
<v Speaker 3>Four or five weeks.</v>

2778
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:32.724
<v Speaker 3>I don't know it was,</v>

2779
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but what I could get mad if he had a beer.</v>

2780
01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Donald Cerrone drinks Budweiser up until the fucking week of his weight cut.</v>

2781
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:39.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>

2782
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.370
<v Speaker 3>And he doesn't just drink a little,</v>

2783
01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:42.204
<v Speaker 3>he drinks a lot.</v>

2784
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 3>What's worse for you?</v>

2785
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol or cocaine?</v>

2786
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2787
01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much John was doing,</v>

2788
01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 3>but a little line here and there is probably not as bad as the amount of</v>

2789
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Budweiser that Donald socks down.</v>

2790
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:51.390
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2791
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.930
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2792
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:52.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2793
01:12:52.141 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know man.</v>

2794
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:54.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2795
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the issue that people have with a guy like John who's just so</v>

2796
01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Uber talented and he's so young and all these things come handy,</v>

2797
01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Tammy said,</v>

2798
01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:02.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2799
01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.300
<v Speaker 3>just come so,</v>

2800
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:08.590
<v Speaker 3>so easy to him is that when a guy like that professors to be like very moral and</v>

2801
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:10.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2802
01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:14.760
<v Speaker 3>very religious and then you see all this craziness like tested positive for</v>

2803
01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:17.310
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and the drunk driving crash into a tree,</v>

2804
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 3>which strippers in his car.</v>

2805
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:18.691
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2806
01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:19.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2807
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 3>clearly he likes to have fun,</v>

2808
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:21.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2809
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.610
<v Speaker 3>and there's another wrong with that.</v>

2810
01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong at all.</v>

2811
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 3>It's in part of his dumb or the drill dumb about it though,</v>

2812
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:28.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2813
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:29.580
<v Speaker 3>so really party.</v>

2814
01:13:29.581 --> 01:13:30.330
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2815
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 3>it could be that nobody can control.</v>

2816
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2817
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.181
<v Speaker 3>it's also like when you're,</v>

2818
01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:34.260
<v Speaker 3>that guy came good.</v>

2819
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:35.400
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to listen to anybody,</v>

2820
01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:36.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2821
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.460
<v Speaker 3>you're the fucking man.</v>

2822
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Tons of guys in the UFC and other sports who keep it together.</v>

2823
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2824
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 3>George St Pierre was awesome.</v>

2825
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 3>He was very disciplined.</v>

2826
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:45.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2827
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.130
<v Speaker 3>the still a template together,</v>

2828
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.150
<v Speaker 3>which fucked up too.</v>

2829
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Like George totally underestimated.</v>

2830
01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Matt Serra totally underestimated.</v>

2831
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Matt Serra got in there with him and got crushed and that's just you.</v>

2832
01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:59.940
<v Speaker 3>You got to dot your i's and cross your t's all day,</v>

2833
01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:00.774
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>

2834
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.580
<v Speaker 3>You can't take anyone lightly.</v>

2835
01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 3>And we've,</v>

2836
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that many times where guys were way favored over their opponent,</v>

2837
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.380
<v Speaker 3>but they took it lightly because they were favorite and their opponent was</v>

2838
01:14:10.381 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 3>terrified because they were the underdog.</v>

2839
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.410
<v Speaker 3>So they train like a demon and the other guy's slacked off and went in there</v>

2840
01:14:15.411 --> 01:14:17.980
<v Speaker 3>with a false sense of confidence and also,</v>

2841
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2842
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:20.710
<v Speaker 3>minimize sense of danger.</v>

2843
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody likes that fucking feeling,</v>

2844
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:23.231
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2845
01:14:23.231 --> 01:14:24.130
<v Speaker 3>You and you went through it,</v>

2846
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:24.341
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2847
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2848
01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.090
<v Speaker 3>That feeling of being in the locker room,</v>

2849
01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:26.500
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2850
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.150
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2851
01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:28.060
<v Speaker 3>gluttonous is over.</v>

2852
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll get me out there.</v>

2853
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:31.810
<v Speaker 3>When I stopped competing,</v>

2854
01:14:31.811 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 3>there was the one thing that I appreciated the most.</v>

2855
01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't have to feel like I was always scared.</v>

2856
01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:37.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2857
01:14:37.341 --> 01:14:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I was always like,</v>

2858
01:14:38.331 --> 01:14:40.070
<v Speaker 1>we're waiting for the next fight.</v>

2859
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2860
01:14:40.611 --> 01:14:40.751
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2861
01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:41.231
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2872
01:14:51.021 --> 01:14:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I still owe money on my face on it.</v>

2873
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Think about me when you get your coffee.</v>

2874
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.883
<v Speaker 1>That's great man.</v>

2875
01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty keen on that thing.</v>

2876
01:14:56.661 --> 01:14:57.481
<v Speaker 1>I already think about Q,</v>

2877
01:14:57.481 --> 01:14:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I drink my coffee.</v>

2878
01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2879
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.081
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2880
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I sort of thought about Mano a Mano conflict of,</v>

2881
01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:02.521
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2882
01:15:02.521 --> 01:15:04.920
<v Speaker 1>of various kinds and uh,</v>

2883
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2884
01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.290
<v Speaker 1>so an MMA fight or any kind of combat sport fights,</v>

2885
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.133
<v Speaker 1>kind of a dual,</v>

2886
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>set it up in advance.</v>

2887
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2888
01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you have seconds who negotiate for you work your corner and all that stuff and</v>

2889
01:15:16.881 --> 01:15:17.714
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2890
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:18.411
<v Speaker 1>weeks out,</v>

2891
01:15:18.411 --> 01:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>months out,</v>

2892
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:23.950
<v Speaker 1>even you even longer that you're going to be in a car crash at such and such a</v>

2893
01:15:24.081 --> 01:15:24.501
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2894
01:15:24.501 --> 01:15:25.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2895
01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.270
<v Speaker 1>and it weighs on you,</v>

2896
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2897
01:15:26.601 --> 01:15:27.890
<v Speaker 1>weighs on you so heavy.</v>

2898
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:29.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2899
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.811
<v Speaker 1>whereas,</v>

2900
01:15:29.811 --> 01:15:29.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2901
01:15:29.991 --> 01:15:33.410
<v Speaker 1>if you were to walk out in the parking lot right now and some guy picked a fight</v>

2902
01:15:33.411 --> 01:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>with you that be bad,</v>

2903
01:15:35.481 --> 01:15:35.801
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't,</v>

2904
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have the same kind of fear and anxiety that the buildup to it.</v>

2905
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2906
01:15:39.741 --> 01:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I was glad to get that out of my life.</v>

2907
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2908
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:42.381
<v Speaker 1>because I had,</v>

2909
01:15:42.381 --> 01:15:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I looked at that for a long time because it took me a long time to get a fight</v>

2910
01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>to me in a long time because I was old and state commission makes it pretty hard</v>

2911
01:15:48.951 --> 01:15:50.240
<v Speaker 1>for older fighters to,</v>

2912
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:50.530
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2913
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:52.670
<v Speaker 1>to allow a certain match up in fights,</v>

2914
01:15:52.671 --> 01:15:56.710
<v Speaker 1>kept calling through or somebody would not show up or I would get hurt or that</v>

2915
01:15:56.711 --> 01:15:56.871
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

2916
01:15:56.871 --> 01:15:57.441
<v Speaker 1>we get hurt.</v>

2917
01:15:57.441 --> 01:16:01.550
<v Speaker 1>And so I live with that sense that the fight was right around the corner for</v>

2918
01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:02.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe six months.</v>

2919
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Did fuck with your sleep?</v>

2920
01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2921
01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:04.730
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2922
01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:04.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2923
01:16:04.911 --> 01:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I just lived in,</v>

2924
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I lived with his mild sense of anxiety punctuated by these stabs of terror,</v>

2925
01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2926
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I would start negotiating with myself saying to myself,</v>

2927
01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:14.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2928
01:16:14.481 --> 01:16:15.880
<v Speaker 1>other writers have done this before,</v>

2929
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:16.461
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

2930
01:16:16.461 --> 01:16:16.640
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

2931
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.480
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of this?</v>

2932
01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:17.751
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2933
01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no point in actually fighting,</v>

2934
01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:19.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2935
01:16:19.431 --> 01:16:19.731
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

2936
01:16:19.731 --> 01:16:20.221
<v Speaker 1>you can train it,</v>

2937
01:16:20.221 --> 01:16:20.481
<v Speaker 1>the gym,</v>

2938
01:16:20.481 --> 01:16:21.141
<v Speaker 1>you can do a lot of stuff.</v>

2939
01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no point in actually having a,</v>

2940
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the actual fight as well.</v>

2941
01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I was glad to get that out of the way and I was glad to get out of the weight</v>

2942
01:16:26.811 --> 01:16:29.210
<v Speaker 1>management because that was the other hard thing about it.</v>

2943
01:16:29.211 --> 01:16:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So for those six months,</v>

2944
01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I was staying at a very uh,</v>

2945
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.690
<v Speaker 1>low way.</v>

2946
01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:34.220
<v Speaker 1>What were you trying to weigh in at?</v>

2947
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2948
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I started the project and close to 200 pounds.</v>

2949
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I was heavier,</v>

2950
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:38.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2951
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:39.590
<v Speaker 1>kind of fat.</v>

2952
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:40.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2953
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2954
01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>

2955
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2956
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>so like if I want 85,</v>

2957
01:16:44.571 --> 01:16:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I could fight at two oh five,</v>

2958
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:46.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2959
01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:48.380
<v Speaker 1>bulk up and quite the huge guys.</v>

2960
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2961
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2962
01:16:49.581 --> 01:16:50.251
<v Speaker 1>by decided to fight,</v>

2963
01:16:50.251 --> 01:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll win all the way down to one 70.</v>

2964
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2965
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and so I cut down to where I was walking around like one 80.</v>

2966
01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Cause at the amateurs you don't have 24,</v>

2967
01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.401
<v Speaker 1>30 hours,</v>

2968
01:16:58.401 --> 01:16:58.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2969
01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:00.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is to rehydrate.</v>

2970
01:17:00.051 --> 01:17:00.884
<v Speaker 1>How much do you have?</v>

2971
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2972
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:06.140
<v Speaker 1>we weighed in like a 10 o'clock in the morning for a,</v>

2973
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:07.040
<v Speaker 1>for a fight.</v>

2974
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.431
<v Speaker 1>Fights.</v>

2975
01:17:07.431 --> 01:17:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It started at seven that day.</v>

2976
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2977
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.461
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2978
01:17:10.461 --> 01:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>that's dangerous.</v>

2979
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:12.194
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2980
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.130
<v Speaker 2>People don't cut a lot of weight,</v>

2981
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:13.791
<v Speaker 2>so I kinda like,</v>

2982
01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:14.624
<v Speaker 2>should you cut?</v>

2983
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2984
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

2985
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I started cutting like the week of like bit starving myself and mild</v>

2986
01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>dehydration.</v>

2987
01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2988
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:21.240
<v Speaker 2>and by the time,</v>

2989
01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.460
<v Speaker 2>by like the night before my fight,</v>

2990
01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I was like one 76,</v>

2991
01:17:23.751 --> 01:17:24.201
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2992
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And then I got up in the morning and sweated it all out.</v>

2993
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.210
<v Speaker 2>So you sweat out six pounds,</v>

2994
01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:28.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2995
01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:29.300
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2996
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I've actually overdid it.</v>

2997
01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I kind of screwed up because I didn't have a scale.</v>

2998
01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea how much I was actually sweating down.</v>

2999
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3000
01:17:35.271 --> 01:17:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I had a scale way.</v>

3001
01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea how you cut weight and then fought the same day.</v>

3002
01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal in most places.</v>

3003
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:41.661
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3004
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:42.610
<v Speaker 2>how are they going to know,</v>

3005
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.200
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3006
01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3007
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you get to know,</v>

3008
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>did you rehydrate?</v>

3009
01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:46.641
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3010
01:17:46.641 --> 01:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I know I was.</v>

3011
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I was at one 68.5 at Wingham,</v>

3012
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.030
<v Speaker 2>so I actually lost like seven pounds that morning or seven and a half pounds.</v>

3013
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3014
01:17:54.230 --> 01:17:55.063
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3015
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.180
<v Speaker 2>and then I just,</v>

3016
01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.650
<v Speaker 2>well no ivs.</v>

3017
01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3018
01:17:58.190 --> 01:17:58.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3019
01:17:58.461 --> 01:17:58.641
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3020
01:17:58.641 --> 01:17:58.881
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

3021
01:17:58.881 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3022
01:17:59.120 --> 01:17:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3023
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3024
01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing a scientific way co,</v>

3025
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3026
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're a smart guy.</v>

3027
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3028
01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:04.191
<v Speaker 2>But I'd read up on it,</v>

3029
01:18:04.191 --> 01:18:04.791
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know how,</v>

3030
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:08.300
<v Speaker 2>how would I get a guy to give me an idea how to talk to a fucking doctor.</v>

3031
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:12.230
<v Speaker 2>You went through all this preparation and didn't prepare enough to find a</v>

3032
01:18:12.231 --> 01:18:12.621
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

3033
01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3034
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.521
<v Speaker 2>Nivea drip.</v>

3035
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:14.354
<v Speaker 2>It's just water.</v>

3036
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing unethical about it.</v>

3037
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3038
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it when you're demeaning.</v>

3039
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Treat it.</v>

3040
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 2>That does not appear to be the culture of,</v>

3041
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3042
01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:21.523
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

3043
01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 2>of the MMA world that I was moving in.</v>

3044
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean,</v>

3045
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the guys were getting ivs,</v>

3046
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but they're crazy.</v>

3047
01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:29.150
<v Speaker 2>If they're not cutting weight,</v>

3048
01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you should get an ivy.</v>

3049
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I still put every pound of those six pounds back on by,</v>

3050
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.881
<v Speaker 2>by the time the fight give,</v>

3051
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:35.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3052
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.460
<v Speaker 2>the issue's not putting the water back on.</v>

3053
01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:38.960
<v Speaker 2>It's getting the water in your brain.</v>

3054
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3055
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 2>that's the real issue.</v>

3056
01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 2>All of the more significant deaths,</v>

3057
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:43.911
<v Speaker 2>brain damage,</v>

3058
01:18:43.911 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 2>all the big issues and boxing,</v>

3059
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them up to like it except for a few isolated events,</v>

3060
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 2>which were horrible beatings,</v>

3061
01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>which is why I think Eric Perez was involved in one.</v>

3062
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Is it Eric Perez?</v>

3063
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Heavyweight?</v>

3064
01:18:56.850 --> 01:19:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I was involved in some horrible beating of this Russian guy and that guy</v>

3065
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:01.970
<v Speaker 2>suffered some pretty significant brain damage,</v>

3066
01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.040
<v Speaker 2>which is a heavyweight belt,</v>

3067
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:04.250
<v Speaker 2>which is very rare.</v>

3068
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:05.203
<v Speaker 2>It's usually little guys.</v>

3069
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 2>It's usually the people that cut weight.</v>

3070
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 2>It's usually the people that cut weight,</v>

3071
01:19:09.381 --> 01:19:10.940
<v Speaker 2>the duck Ku Kim's and yeah,</v>

3072
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the fights where they made the way in the day before the</v>

3073
01:19:15.921 --> 01:19:16.311
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

3074
01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:18.490
<v Speaker 2>They changed it after that fight.</v>

3075
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 2>They also change it from 15 rounds to 12 rounds because you know,</v>

3076
01:19:21.621 --> 01:19:22.640
<v Speaker 2>people were realizing like,</v>

3077
01:19:22.641 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3078
01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 2>like this is fucking dangerous.</v>

3079
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Losing all this weight.</v>

3080
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 2>You dehydrate your actual brain,</v>

3081
01:19:27.951 --> 01:19:30.620
<v Speaker 2>you make yourself more susceptible to brain trauma and bleeding.</v>

3082
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3083
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Gerald Mcclellan.</v>

3084
01:19:32.251 --> 01:19:36.410
<v Speaker 2>So and other one was a notoriously huge guy would cut a tremendous amount of</v>

3085
01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:37.101
<v Speaker 2>weight to get down.</v>

3086
01:19:37.101 --> 01:19:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I think he's fighting at one 75 the one 75 one 68 I forget what,</v>

3087
01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:42.771
<v Speaker 2>what he fought at,</v>

3088
01:19:42.771 --> 01:19:45.500
<v Speaker 2>but Gerald cut a tremendous amount of weight,</v>

3089
01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:46.281
<v Speaker 2>got down,</v>

3090
01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:47.600
<v Speaker 2>fought Nigel Benn and,</v>

3091
01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:49.140
<v Speaker 2>and had like a,</v>

3092
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.473
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

3093
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.740
<v Speaker 2>he was bleeding inside the octagon like or inside the ring rather.</v>

3094
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:55.860
<v Speaker 2>He had a,</v>

3095
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.780
<v Speaker 2>an episode where he like had a stroke inside the ring.</v>

3096
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Like in the middle of his fight he had to take a knee and then just quit and</v>

3097
01:20:03.441 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 2>realized something was way wrong.</v>

3098
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And people like that can't,</v>

3099
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he quit and he collapsed in his corner and you know,</v>

3100
01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:10.080
<v Speaker 2>the rest is history.</v>

3101
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.370
<v Speaker 2>He's all fucked up now.</v>

3102
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:13.890
<v Speaker 2>And if you went back to the day,</v>

3103
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 2>if you ever watched that guy fight,</v>

3104
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>you've ever see Gerald Mcclellan fight like back in the day?</v>

3105
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:19.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3106
01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:24.681
<v Speaker 2>he was a terrifying fighter and the big show down was always going to be him and</v>

3107
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones jr that's what everybody was thinking.</v>

3108
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:28.441
<v Speaker 2>Like one day,</v>

3109
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:30.240
<v Speaker 2>him and Roy Jones Jr going to throw down.</v>

3110
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Gerald McClellan was fucking killer.</v>

3111
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>He was a killer.</v>

3112
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:37.080
<v Speaker 2>But he fought Nigel Benn and Nigel band was just tough as shit.</v>

3113
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.340
<v Speaker 2>And they went to war and Gerald had them all but knocked out,</v>

3114
01:20:41.341 --> 01:20:42.690
<v Speaker 2>had them knocked out of the ring,</v>

3115
01:20:42.691 --> 01:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>like you went through the ring,</v>

3116
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.380
<v Speaker 2>got back into the ring,</v>

3117
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.880
<v Speaker 2>got back.</v>

3118
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 2>But just nodule ban would not quit.</v>

3119
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:51.900
<v Speaker 2>And there was a period in the fight somewhere where they collided heads.</v>

3120
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the big ones mean Nigel definitely land.</v>

3121
01:20:54.361 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a big punches on them,</v>

3122
01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.460
<v Speaker 2>but they collided heads and you could tell like after the head,</v>

3123
01:20:58.461 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 2>but like he was all fucking woozy and whacked out and then,</v>

3124
01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3125
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.110
<v Speaker 2>he had to take a knee and then it was over.</v>

3126
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

3127
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 2>he's blind now.</v>

3128
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he can't hear,</v>

3129
01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:09.420
<v Speaker 2>he can't move.</v>

3130
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:12.240
<v Speaker 2>He's all fucked up and it's all just from brain bleeding.</v>

3131
01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:13.111
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3132
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:14.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a real issue.</v>

3133
01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:16.410
<v Speaker 2>The dehydration issues are real issue.</v>

3134
01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:17.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3135
01:21:17.451 --> 01:21:18.050
<v Speaker 1>And you said,</v>

3136
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3137
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:19.310
<v Speaker 1>earlier on you said,</v>

3138
01:21:19.311 --> 01:21:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3139
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.810
<v Speaker 1>how do you stop it?</v>

3140
01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think it,</v>

3141
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:22.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it is one of those things,</v>

3142
01:21:22.641 --> 01:21:23.061
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

3143
01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:24.700
<v Speaker 1>really hard to stop because you know,</v>

3144
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:26.030
<v Speaker 1>as you've talked about on the show,</v>

3145
01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.360
<v Speaker 1>any kind of a new measure you set up,</v>

3146
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.171
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to beat it.</v>

3147
01:21:30.171 --> 01:21:30.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a way,</v>

3148
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:32.690
<v Speaker 1>there's still going to be a cutting way.</v>

3149
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I think amateur wrestling has dealt with this,</v>

3150
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.620
<v Speaker 1>a little kits,</v>

3151
01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:37.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3152
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.250
<v Speaker 1>by body fat percentages of things or maybe hydration,</v>

3153
01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:40.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3154
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:41.421
<v Speaker 1>measurements.</v>

3155
01:21:41.421 --> 01:21:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you can measure how much a hydration there they haven't.</v>

3156
01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:49.100
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell when the kid is cutting weight through dehydration.</v>

3157
01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3158
01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if that will be possible to,</v>

3159
01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:54.320
<v Speaker 1>to measure hydration levels and that might be one way to,</v>

3160
01:21:54.321 --> 01:21:55.154
<v Speaker 1>to deal with it.</v>

3161
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:56.083
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3162
01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:56.421
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3163
01:21:56.421 --> 01:21:56.991
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with you.</v>

3164
01:21:56.991 --> 01:21:58.010
<v Speaker 1>That one's a hard one to fix.</v>

3165
01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.420
<v Speaker 1>That's why I keep going back to the gloves.</v>

3166
01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with the gloves things.</v>

3167
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3168
01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Right now we use those test with them for a good reason.</v>

3169
01:22:03.261 --> 01:22:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3170
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you agree on this,</v>

3171
01:22:05.241 --> 01:22:06.140
<v Speaker 1>after all your study,</v>

3172
01:22:06.141 --> 01:22:07.700
<v Speaker 1>after all these years,</v>

3173
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:08.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3174
01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.380
<v Speaker 1>and I agree on it,</v>

3175
01:22:09.381 --> 01:22:09.830
<v Speaker 1>why isn't,</v>

3176
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:10.131
<v Speaker 1>why didn't,</v>

3177
01:22:10.131 --> 01:22:12.110
<v Speaker 1>why do you think it's not a happening?</v>

3178
01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's incredibly hard to change.</v>

3179
01:22:14.121 --> 01:22:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Once</v>

3180
01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:19.120
<v Speaker 2>these commissions have these rules and regulations in pray in place,</v>

3181
01:22:19.121 --> 01:22:20.470
<v Speaker 2>they're very difficult to change.</v>

3182
01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Once they're established,</v>

3183
01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.660
<v Speaker 2>they're insanely difficult</v>

3184
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

3185
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a policy would be against it or for it.</v>

3186
01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The USC probably would be against it</v>

3187
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 2>in the current state.</v>

3188
01:22:30.630 --> 01:22:30.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3189
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:32.220
<v Speaker 2>even if they listened to me,</v>

3190
01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.010
<v Speaker 2>they rationalize like,</v>

3191
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:34.211
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3192
01:22:34.211 --> 01:22:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you got some good points.</v>

3193
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:39.060
<v Speaker 2>And then there would be all but bubble blow we can't because blah blah blah over</v>

3194
01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:39.840
<v Speaker 2>the Bubba bubby,</v>

3195
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3196
01:22:40.141 --> 01:22:40.921
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

3197
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:42.690
<v Speaker 2>people would think it's barbaric.</v>

3198
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.670
<v Speaker 2>So the public perception,</v>

3199
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>public perception,</v>

3200
01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:46.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3201
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:47.430
<v Speaker 2>more cuts,</v>

3202
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 2>which is probably true,</v>

3203
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.610
<v Speaker 2>probably a lot more cuts from knuckles.</v>

3204
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Knuckles were hand injuries in first and much more hand until the shorter hours,</v>

3205
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.980
<v Speaker 2>shorter careers.</v>

3206
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>You would shorten your careers.</v>

3207
01:22:57.421 --> 01:22:57.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3208
01:22:57.631 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 2>there's certain guys that have had like significant head injuries.</v>

3209
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.470
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why when you see Vitor Belfort throw all these kicks recently</v>

3210
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.221
<v Speaker 2>because his hands,</v>

3211
01:23:05.221 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 2>her hands had been broken</v>

3212
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>seven fucking times.</v>

3213
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:08.680
<v Speaker 1>He's said seven injuries,</v>

3214
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 1>a seven surgeries rather.</v>

3215
01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I think my,</v>

3216
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.273
<v Speaker 1>my uh,</v>

3217
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I think the major obstacle to it,</v>

3218
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:14.921
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3219
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:19.180
<v Speaker 1>if you thought it all through the major obstacle to it would be the upside of</v>

3220
01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:21.430
<v Speaker 1>this is it would be a lot less neurological damage.</v>

3221
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.070
<v Speaker 1>The downside to it would be there'd be a lot less neurological damage and be a</v>

3222
01:23:27.071 --> 01:23:28.210
<v Speaker 1>lot fewer knockouts.</v>

3223
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3224
01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a lot less heavy,</v>

3225
01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3226
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3227
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 1>the barrages of heavy punches.</v>

3228
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3229
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 1>and they'd have to change their,</v>

3230
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:35.921
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3231
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:36.131
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3232
01:23:36.131 --> 01:23:37.420
<v Speaker 1>their repertoire of punches.</v>

3233
01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:41.080
<v Speaker 1>He had to go back towards the bare knuckle style style of punching a much,</v>

3234
01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

3235
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 1>much more straight punches,</v>

3236
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3237
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:46.790
<v Speaker 1>trying to throw punches into the fleshy part of the face that you're throwing up</v>

3238
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 1>with more control,</v>

3239
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 1>many more punches to the padded torso using these two knuckles as well,</v>

3240
01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:53.740
<v Speaker 1>using the front two knuckles.</v>

3241
01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3242
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.060
<v Speaker 1>in traditional,</v>

3243
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.870
<v Speaker 1>she read a bare knuckle boxing book and you know,</v>

3244
01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:02.860
<v Speaker 1>they go back to the techniques of how it was done back then and they,</v>

3245
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 1>they're not giving that to the,</v>

3246
01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:04.620
<v Speaker 1>to knuckle things would,</v>

3247
01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:04.870
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

3248
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:05.703
<v Speaker 1>I always learned to,</v>

3249
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a boxer's teach what martial artists teach.</v>

3250
01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3251
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:08.621
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3252
01:24:08.621 --> 01:24:08.980
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3253
01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:10.990
<v Speaker 1>their thing and it makes some sense.</v>

3254
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.900
<v Speaker 1>They're saying this is a surface,</v>

3255
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you turn it that way so you have more surface area.</v>

3256
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:19.420
<v Speaker 1>So you're not screaming,</v>

3257
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not putting so much damage here.</v>

3258
01:24:20.891 --> 01:24:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

3259
01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people say,</v>

3260
01:24:22.521 --> 01:24:22.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3261
01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you're in alignment there,</v>

3262
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 1>but you're kind of also an alignment there.</v>

3263
01:24:25.331 --> 01:24:26.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not so bad either.</v>

3264
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:27.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3265
01:24:27.641 --> 01:24:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the real issue is to write the bare knuckle boxing.</v>

3266
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.240
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is they would throw it perpendicular.</v>

3267
01:24:33.241 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3268
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Instead of parallel with the ground throw,</v>

3269
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:38.080
<v Speaker 1>throw a perpendicular punch into a boxing,</v>

3270
01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:38.351
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3271
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 1>until heavy bag and see what it feels like.</v>

3272
01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And you don't get as much power,</v>

3273
01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as much power.</v>

3274
01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's designed to be that way because if you throw us out of the hands</v>

3275
01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:49.450
<v Speaker 1>because your fist will just explode on contact.</v>

3276
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3277
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people wouldn't have any problem with it.</v>

3278
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Some people would like big giant hands like Brock Lesnar hands or Shane car when</v>

3279
01:24:56.471 --> 01:24:56.771
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

3280
01:24:56.771 --> 01:24:59.050
<v Speaker 1>those guys probably wouldn't have nearly as much problem.</v>

3281
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:04.150
<v Speaker 1>But if you can go back to the old UFC and you see when guys fought bare knuckle,</v>

3282
01:25:04.151 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you've very rarely saw like blistering combinations.</v>

3283
01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll see like a guy like [inaudible],</v>

3284
01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you know barrages of punches.</v>

3285
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:14.140
<v Speaker 1>He very rarely see those cause he's just Kinda can't,</v>

3286
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you kind of can't do those without breaking your hand.</v>

3287
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And they did break their hands a lot.</v>

3288
01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:18.550
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3289
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:19.001
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

3290
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I thought that article I wrote with a retrospective on,</v>

3291
01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 1>remember this fight,</v>

3292
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest fights in the UFC,</v>

3293
01:25:25.150 --> 01:25:27.430
<v Speaker 1>a hackney versus Yarber all shore.</v>

3294
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:28.390
<v Speaker 1>He bitch slapped him.</v>

3295
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:32.220
<v Speaker 1>You know [inaudible] was like a 600 pound sumo wrestler who's six,</v>

3296
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.930
<v Speaker 1>eight Agnes probably to 15 maybe he was,</v>

3297
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:37.990
<v Speaker 1>he weighed in at 200 200 karate guy.</v>

3298
01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And this was the early wild west days of the USC where they like,</v>

3299
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.181
<v Speaker 1>what will happen?</v>

3300
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:43.631
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

3301
01:25:43.631 --> 01:25:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

3302
01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens.</v>

3303
01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:45.460
<v Speaker 1>What happens when,</v>

3304
01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:45.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3305
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:49.300
<v Speaker 1>a normal size man fights a giant and you know,</v>

3306
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:50.410
<v Speaker 1>long story short,</v>

3307
01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:53.260
<v Speaker 1>a hackney hits him in the head,</v>

3308
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:53.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3309
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 1>41 straight times.</v>

3310
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I counted with his right hand and at some point,</v>

3311
01:25:59.291 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3312
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>he gets a yard boiled turtled up on the ground and he's hitting him from the</v>

3313
01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>back</v>

3314
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.420
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

3315
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.660
<v Speaker 2>he's hooking him from behind.</v>

3316
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>He's coming in the back of the skull.</v>

3317
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:07.880
<v Speaker 2>You could do that back then.</v>

3318
01:26:07.881 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 2>He's raising his hand up high,</v>

3319
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 2>like a black Jack and he's like camera focusing on one side and then hammer fist</v>

3320
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>and it on the other and he just screwed up his hand,</v>

3321
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:17.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3322
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.130
<v Speaker 2>terribly.</v>

3323
01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:18.511
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3324
01:26:18.511 --> 01:26:18.760
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3325
01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3326
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:19.401
<v Speaker 2>he walks,</v>

3327
01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:19.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3328
01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Yarbrough walks out of the rings,</v>

3329
01:26:20.551 --> 01:26:21.384
<v Speaker 2>he's fine,</v>

3330
01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:22.820
<v Speaker 2>he tapped out verbally,</v>

3331
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but he walked out of the ring looking no worse for wear.</v>

3332
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Those punches weren't all that effective.</v>

3333
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3334
01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.760
<v Speaker 2>how can he goes out of the ring looking at his fist and it's swelling up and</v>

3335
01:26:31.761 --> 01:26:32.241
<v Speaker 2>it's bleeding.</v>

3336
01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:33.140
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end for him.</v>

3337
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:35.450
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get to go to the next round because he had broken his hand.</v>

3338
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3339
01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:37.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3340
01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:37.943
<v Speaker 2>to me it was,</v>

3341
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.110
<v Speaker 2>it's this great illustration of what would have happened if hackney had a glove</v>

3342
01:26:42.111 --> 01:26:42.830
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

3343
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.120
<v Speaker 2>He would have beaten them to sleep.</v>

3344
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3345
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Probably big head Yarbrough's in</v>

3346
01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Hackney is a strong guy and he threw 41 punches at his brain,</v>

3347
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3348
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.700
<v Speaker 2>and how can it was put in,</v>

3349
01:26:55.701 --> 01:26:57.050
<v Speaker 2>your role was putting up no defense.</v>

3350
01:26:57.051 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 2>He weighed 600 pounds.</v>

3351
01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.300
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't get up.</v>

3352
01:26:59.380 --> 01:26:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3353
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 2>He was stuck there on the ground.</v>

3354
01:27:00.951 --> 01:27:03.320
<v Speaker 2>He's just laying there and getting punched in the head over and over and over</v>

3355
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3356
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:03.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3357
01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 2>He's probably in the worst shape of any guy who ever fought in the UFC.</v>

3358
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3359
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:08.421
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Aki.</v>

3360
01:27:08.421 --> 01:27:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Bono hoists crazy.</v>

3361
01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3362
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:12.800
<v Speaker 2>And in retrospect it looked incredibly barbaric because you're like,</v>

3363
01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:14.510
<v Speaker 2>that guy should never have been in cage.</v>

3364
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 2>But people didn't know back then.</v>

3365
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:16.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3366
01:27:16.551 --> 01:27:17.910
<v Speaker 2>he was a giant sumo champion.</v>

3367
01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:18.831
<v Speaker 2>He was giant.</v>

3368
01:27:18.831 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Speaker 2>He was someone athletic,</v>

3369
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:20.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3370
01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>he did some kind of athletic things in that Matt moved.</v>

3371
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:23.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3372
01:27:23.091 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 2>He moved like you did.</v>

3373
01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:25.813
<v Speaker 2>He did a,</v>

3374
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.601
<v Speaker 2>that was enough.</v>

3375
01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3376
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it was 600 pounds.</v>

3377
01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 2>He's chasing like a giant.</v>

3378
01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:30.190
<v Speaker 2>He's got his arms out.</v>

3379
01:27:30.190 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like Frankenstein chasing him down.</v>

3380
01:27:31.611 --> 01:27:32.110
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3381
01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:32.320
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3382
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:32.600
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3383
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 2>he literally through a hackney through the cage,</v>

3384
01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3385
01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 2>threw him out of the cage and down the stairs,</v>

3386
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:37.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3387
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:38.151
<v Speaker 2>broke,</v>

3388
01:27:38.151 --> 01:27:38.810
<v Speaker 2>broke the,</v>

3389
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 2>broke the gate.</v>

3390
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:42.950
<v Speaker 2>What would hackney did was hit him with an open palm and I think that was the</v>

3391
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 2>first knockdown as think if he stuck with that,</v>

3392
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:46.250
<v Speaker 2>he probably wouldn't have broken his hand,</v>

3393
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.480
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of amazing.</v>

3394
01:27:47.481 --> 01:27:49.700
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever reason you can,</v>

3395
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you can hit things really hard like that with the palm of your hand.</v>

3396
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.370
<v Speaker 2>And partly because you can hit very hard that way.</v>

3397
01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:55.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3398
01:27:55.941 --> 01:27:57.100
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it if you hit the,</v>

3399
01:27:57.130 --> 01:27:57.370
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3400
01:27:57.370 --> 01:27:58.051
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

3401
01:27:58.051 --> 01:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>And like you can,</v>

3402
01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.600
<v Speaker 2>if you're not turning it over,</v>

3403
01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:02.360
<v Speaker 2>was he ever watch boss route and fight and pancreas?</v>

3404
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.050
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3405
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Boss route and figured out how to do it.</v>

3406
01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3407
01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was the first guy that really figured out pancreas was organization.</v>

3408
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3409
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Pancreas was an organization for folks who don't know in Japan and they didn't</v>

3410
01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:15.650
<v Speaker 2>allow gloves and they also didn't allow punches to the face.</v>

3411
01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 2>You could kick the guy to the face,</v>

3412
01:28:16.821 --> 01:28:18.740
<v Speaker 2>but you were wearing wrestling shoes.</v>

3413
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.680
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of those wrestling shoes you had these big fat thin,</v>

3414
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:22.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3415
01:28:22.041 --> 01:28:24.380
<v Speaker 2>this big fat Shin and instep pad.</v>

3416
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:29.660
<v Speaker 2>So there's this big padded up Shin thing and then you had nothing on your hands.</v>

3417
01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:33.260
<v Speaker 2>So the guys would get a slap at each other and try to kick each other.</v>

3418
01:28:33.261 --> 01:28:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And that was the rule to right.</v>

3419
01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.810
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't throw clothes hand,</v>

3420
01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I could not throw a closed hands,</v>

3421
01:28:37.161 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 2>but you could throw a closed hands to the body.</v>

3422
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:44.410
<v Speaker 2>But Bas Rutten who was a Dutch kickboxer and had his fucking power explosion</v>

3423
01:28:44.721 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 2>style,</v>

3424
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>he was the first guy that figured out if you just pull your hand way back,</v>

3425
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.300
<v Speaker 2>he throw that bitch just like a punch.</v>

3426
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.500
<v Speaker 2>And he would upper cut guys and hook guys and he would beat,</v>

3427
01:28:54.501 --> 01:28:58.610
<v Speaker 2>like when he fought food knocky he beat the fucking shit out of him and he beat</v>

3428
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>him like a guy who's throwing punches.</v>

3429
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean he would come at</v>

3430
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you with his hands pulled back like that.</v>

3431
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 3>And instead of doing what everybody else was doing,</v>

3432
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 3>which just kind of throw these wild bitch slaps bas Rutten was throwing them</v>

3433
01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:12.780
<v Speaker 3>straight down the pipe and somehow or another he had stretched his hand out.</v>

3434
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Well he could pull his hand way back.</v>

3435
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 3>So he was just palming your fucking nose in your brain.</v>

3436
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Speaker 3>He was nasty.</v>

3437
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.470
<v Speaker 3>He was the first guy to figure out like you could,</v>

3438
01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:22.860
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

3439
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 3>there's a different approach you can take to this who's also one of the first</v>

3440
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 3>real strikers.</v>

3441
01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3442
01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:31.540
<v Speaker 3>you got to see the difference when he kicked guys that fucking whack.</v>

3443
01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>You feel it in their arms.</v>

3444
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:35.323
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3445
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of the beautiful things about watching the UFC since 93 all the</v>

3446
01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 3>way up to 2015 where we are today is,</v>

3447
01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:42.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3448
01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:47.360
<v Speaker 3>the evolution of the understanding of the techniques of what's effective in</v>

3449
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:48.420
<v Speaker 3>certain positions.</v>

3450
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.860
<v Speaker 3>The distances and those guys like boss route and were critical for establishing</v>

3451
01:29:52.861 --> 01:29:53.694
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

3452
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Know there's real pioneers.</v>

3453
01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Fucking nobody before him and pancreas,</v>

3454
01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 3>they were fighting like that.</v>

3455
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:58.743
<v Speaker 3>There's nobody,</v>

3456
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 3>he came along with big power in his kicks and ridiculous punching power.</v>

3457
01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:06.030
<v Speaker 3>And figured out how to do it with the palm,</v>

3458
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:06.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3459
01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and then you see him fight in the UFC when he could use punches before his body</v>

3460
01:30:10.621 --> 01:30:11.580
<v Speaker 3>started failing him.</v>

3461
01:30:11.581 --> 01:30:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Like he's had some significant neck injuries.</v>

3462
01:30:13.981 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 3>And to the point where he has significant atrophy of one of his arms,</v>

3463
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:18.661
<v Speaker 3>one of his arms,</v>

3464
01:30:18.661 --> 01:30:19.620
<v Speaker 3>he calls baby arm.</v>

3465
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3466
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.281
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3467
01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:20.551
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3468
01:30:20.551 --> 01:30:20.791
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3469
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:24.690
<v Speaker 3>he's had it fixed and had some stem cell stuff done and some operations and as</v>

3470
01:30:24.691 --> 01:30:26.070
<v Speaker 3>disks fuse in his neck.</v>

3471
01:30:26.071 --> 01:30:28.470
<v Speaker 3>And that stuff is a cost to this man.</v>

3472
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:29.543
<v Speaker 3>Fuck gatherers.</v>

3473
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.220
<v Speaker 3>But my point is you watched him fight against Chokey,</v>

3474
01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 3>she'll Kosha Co TK,</v>

3475
01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.011
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3476
01:30:35.011 --> 01:30:37.510
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC when he won the heavyweight title and you know,</v>

3477
01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:41.820
<v Speaker 3>he was throwing fucking brutal combinations and his neck was so fucked up before</v>

3478
01:30:41.821 --> 01:30:42.240
<v Speaker 3>that fight.</v>

3479
01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.140
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't even wrestle.</v>

3480
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 3>He fought most of that fight.</v>

3481
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:46.260
<v Speaker 3>And we're trained most of that fight,</v>

3482
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:48.390
<v Speaker 3>just kickboxing because his neck was so fucked up.</v>

3483
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.093
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3484
01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:53.940
<v Speaker 3>I remember him wearing a red boots and a Pancrase probably.</v>

3485
01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.350
<v Speaker 3>We're a bunch of different boots,</v>

3486
01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3487
01:30:55.770 --> 01:30:56.041
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

3488
01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:57.030
<v Speaker 3>But you could kick with the boots.</v>

3489
01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3490
01:30:57.490 --> 01:30:57.701
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3491
01:30:57.701 --> 01:30:57.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3492
01:30:57.981 --> 01:30:58.290
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

3493
01:30:58.290 --> 01:31:00.060
<v Speaker 3>you had these wrestling shoes on with these,</v>

3494
01:31:00.061 --> 01:31:00.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3495
01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Shannon step cards over the top of the wrestling shoes.</v>

3496
01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:03.923
<v Speaker 3>I thought he had like,</v>

3497
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:05.820
<v Speaker 3>like big patent,</v>

3498
01:31:05.821 --> 01:31:06.654
<v Speaker 3>leather red,</v>

3499
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:08.401
<v Speaker 3>no excuse,</v>

3500
01:31:08.401 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 3>miss misremembering.</v>

3501
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.230
<v Speaker 3>And they were wrestling shoes.</v>

3502
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:10.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3503
01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:11.670
<v Speaker 3>they were wrestling shoes.</v>

3504
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Pancrase had like an outfit that they would make you where you would wear like</v>

3505
01:31:15.481 --> 01:31:18.960
<v Speaker 3>those little skivvies and you weren't wearing like those MMA shorts the guys</v>

3506
01:31:18.961 --> 01:31:19.561
<v Speaker 3>wear today.</v>

3507
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wore like this little speedos.</v>

3508
01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3509
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Little grape smugglers.</v>

3510
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:25.000
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3511
01:31:25.001 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3512
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:26.003
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3513
01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:29.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like an important time historically to watch those fights,</v>

3514
01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:35.040
<v Speaker 3>to say the difference between the way they fought then and the way they fight</v>

3515
01:31:35.041 --> 01:31:35.820
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3516
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:36.151
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3517
01:31:36.151 --> 01:31:36.984
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3518
01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.700
<v Speaker 3>there's still room to grow.</v>

3519
01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:41.040
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is you have athletic commissions,</v>

3520
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:42.180
<v Speaker 3>you have bureaucracy,</v>

3521
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 3>and you also have,</v>

3522
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.031
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3523
01:31:45.031 --> 01:31:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I love the UFC.</v>

3524
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I love working for the UFC.</v>

3525
01:31:47.791 --> 01:31:49.800
<v Speaker 3>It's been an honor to work for them all these years,</v>

3526
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:53.730
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to have a certain amount of stagnation when you have one group</v>

3527
01:31:53.731 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 3>in one organization that's so dominant over the other ones.</v>

3528
01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 3>I disagree that it's a monopoly because Viacom</v>

3529
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.990
<v Speaker 2>owns Bella tour and Viacom has untold fucking billions of dollars.</v>

3530
01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 2>They have an entire channel they can promote it on the,</v>

3531
01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:08.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3532
01:32:08.861 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Spike TV has an entire Friday night lineup that's dedicated to combat sports,</v>

3533
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.073
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>

3534
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:14.651
<v Speaker 2>glory,</v>

3535
01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing mean.</v>

3536
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:18.050
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of eyes on spike I,</v>

3537
01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 2>and they're also getting guys from the UFC now.</v>

3538
01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Like they have Phil Davis just sign with them.</v>

3539
01:32:22.761 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

3540
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of the senior league for the UFC.</v>

3541
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:26.681
<v Speaker 2>And there's also,</v>

3542
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>they picked up this wrestler of the sky who,</v>

3543
01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3544
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.290
<v Speaker 2>helped Chris Weidman prepare for one of his recent fights.</v>

3545
01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:32.760
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

3546
01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.011
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

3547
01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:36.850
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to get like these big time names guys that are coming up.</v>

3548
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that is also because of the Reebok deal.</v>

3549
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has a Reebok deal that doesn't allow them to get their own sponsors.</v>

3550
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:44.370
<v Speaker 2>They have to use the Reebok sponsorships.</v>

3551
01:32:44.371 --> 01:32:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So some guys are shying away from it because of that.</v>

3552
01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 2>So like the concept of a monopoly,</v>

3553
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's fair.</v>

3554
01:32:50.351 --> 01:32:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I know I don't agree that it's a monopoly.</v>

3555
01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I think they're better than the rest of them.</v>

3556
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:55.570
<v Speaker 2>There's better competition.</v>

3557
01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:56.710
<v Speaker 2>They're better organized.</v>

3558
01:32:56.711 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I think the production is better.</v>

3559
01:32:58.121 --> 01:33:00.160
<v Speaker 2>The people that direct it and produce it or better,</v>

3560
01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 2>they're just the best at what they do because they've been doing it a long time.</v>

3561
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:06.640
<v Speaker 2>But in having that like that,</v>

3562
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:10.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of stagnation because if someone came along and had a</v>

3563
01:33:10.031 --> 01:33:12.160
<v Speaker 2>bare knuckle UFC style,</v>

3564
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:13.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3565
01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:13.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3566
01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:18.631
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts event where they fought not in a cage but in a basketball</v>

3567
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:19.630
<v Speaker 2>sized Matt,</v>

3568
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3569
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:23.440
<v Speaker 2>like he like if you have arena for basketball,</v>

3570
01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you have this big gigantic space that you have a wooden floors,</v>

3571
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 2>parquet floor on.</v>

3572
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:31.630
<v Speaker 2>How about do something like that with the mats and have,</v>

3573
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.910
<v Speaker 2>have mixed martial arts and when they go out of bounds,</v>

3574
01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you bring them right back to center again.</v>

3575
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:36.580
<v Speaker 2>You have them Duke it out again.</v>

3576
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Cause I cause the fence,</v>

3577
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.220
<v Speaker 2>the fence is starting.</v>

3578
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.550
<v Speaker 2>The fence is interesting but it hurts visually.</v>

3579
01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't see that good me,</v>

3580
01:33:44.081 --> 01:33:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I can't see that good and have the best fucking seat in the house for the UFC.</v>

3581
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm touching the floor that they're fighting,</v>

3582
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:51.760
<v Speaker 2>literally touching the floor.</v>

3583
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I see you looking at the monitor all the time.</v>

3584
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I have to sometimes when,</v>

3585
01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 2>when fighters like to the left or to the right and the backs like they're like</v>

3586
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:00.220
<v Speaker 2>up against the cage.</v>

3587
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I have to look at the Monitor.</v>

3588
01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I don't know what's going.</v>

3589
01:34:02.531 --> 01:34:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever looked at the crowd and we're all looking at the</v>

3590
01:34:04.751 --> 01:34:05.830
<v Speaker 2>monitor to a lot of times.</v>

3591
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's amazing to me.</v>

3592
01:34:07.031 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 2>People pay for this good seats and everybody's looking up at the screen because</v>

3593
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:10.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3594
01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 2>it just shows better up there.</v>

3595
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Less so with boxing,</v>

3596
01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.080
<v Speaker 2>if you watched boxing,</v>

3597
01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:17.230
<v Speaker 2>people were looking at the ring most of the time it's because of the ropes or</v>

3598
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:18.110
<v Speaker 2>the way someone,</v>

3599
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.943
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3600
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:19.811
<v Speaker 2>In that sense,</v>

3601
01:34:19.811 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 2>pride had the better idea when it came to that,</v>

3602
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.620
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

3603
01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:24.340
<v Speaker 2>it was too hard,</v>

3604
01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:28.300
<v Speaker 2>too easy to go flying through the ropes here they had a bunch of Japanese dudes</v>

3605
01:34:28.301 --> 01:34:30.010
<v Speaker 2>outside that we were like ready to press,</v>

3606
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:31.100
<v Speaker 2>keep you from going out.</v>

3607
01:34:31.101 --> 01:34:33.580
<v Speaker 2>And they had guys like would knock in your hand off the ropes.</v>

3608
01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:35.080
<v Speaker 2>It was that it was that.</v>

3609
01:34:35.081 --> 01:34:37.460
<v Speaker 2>It was also like a thought.</v>

3610
01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.440
<v Speaker 2>It was Paulo Filio.</v>

3611
01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I think someone used the ropes want to catch a guy in an arm bar.</v>

3612
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Like you had the guy,</v>

3613
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:46.390
<v Speaker 2>like they were trapped inside the ropes and the guy's arm was trapped in the</v>

3614
01:34:46.391 --> 01:34:46.700
<v Speaker 2>rope.</v>

3615
01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I was getting arm barred and I was realizing like,</v>

3616
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3617
01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:52.130
<v Speaker 2>like he just used the rope to get that submission.</v>

3618
01:34:52.170 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of fucked.</v>

3619
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Like the rope came into play.</v>

3620
01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:57.350
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like what tank Abbott's submitted.</v>

3621
01:34:57.351 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Steve Genom,</v>

3622
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 2>he had his knee to his head and he grabbed the fence and he was holding onto the</v>

3623
01:35:01.371 --> 01:35:04.100
<v Speaker 2>fence and polling and smashing them in the face.</v>

3624
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:09.490
<v Speaker 2>You know that using the cage back then like you can't grab the cage just like</v>

3625
01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:11.360
<v Speaker 2>you can't grab the ropes and pride,</v>

3626
01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:14.740
<v Speaker 2>but it did come into play too often.</v>

3627
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:16.520
<v Speaker 2>It comes into play still too much too.</v>

3628
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:17.631
<v Speaker 2>It'd be interesting.</v>

3629
01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I'd like that because there's so much of the action now is pushed up against the</v>

3630
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>

3631
01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>I think if a guy grabs a fence,</v>

3632
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.920
<v Speaker 2>immediate one point deduction,</v>

3633
01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 2>immediate,</v>

3634
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 2>immediate one point.</v>

3635
01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:28.280
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it's so reflexive.</v>

3636
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't guys,</v>

3637
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.160
<v Speaker 2>most guys don't mean to do.</v>

3638
01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:30.291
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3639
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3640
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3641
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:32.150
<v Speaker 2>some guys do,</v>

3642
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>some guys fucking grabbed that bitch,</v>

3643
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.030
<v Speaker 2>they grab it.</v>

3644
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>They should know.</v>

3645
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 2>You should know.</v>

3646
01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.000
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3647
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:37.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3648
01:35:37.111 --> 01:35:38.000
<v Speaker 2>you gotta know,</v>

3649
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 2>you gotta fucking know.</v>

3650
01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:42.410
<v Speaker 2>And there's a big difference between a guy grabbing the fence when you're trying</v>

3651
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 2>to take him down and then being able to stand up and then kicks you in the head</v>

3652
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and a guy not grabbing the fans and you take him down and you dominate him for</v>

3653
01:35:48.921 --> 01:35:49.551
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the round.</v>

3654
01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 2>And there's certainly could never penalized on it.</v>

3655
01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:51.650
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3656
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3657
01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 2>they get warnings.</v>

3658
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 2>They should get an immediate one point deduction.</v>

3659
01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Same thing for obvious Ipos and immediate one point deduction.</v>

3660
01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.220
<v Speaker 2>And Dana has had this,</v>

3661
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.331
<v Speaker 2>Dana White said this,</v>

3662
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that might be the only way to stop.</v>

3663
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I pokes to give them an immediate one point deduction and I think that might,</v>

3664
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:07.723
<v Speaker 2>it might work.</v>

3665
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I think there's gotta be a way to cover the tips of the fingers.</v>

3666
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>

3667
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think that these Bruce Lee style gloves,</v>

3668
01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:17.690
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was thinking were invented in enter the dragon or the only way to</v>

3669
01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:18.200
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

3670
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3671
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Well we haven't met our gym like some guys.</v>

3672
01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:20.864
<v Speaker 2>Where are those?</v>

3673
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:23.000
<v Speaker 2>The Bruce Lee style gloves.</v>

3674
01:36:23.001 --> 01:36:23.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3675
01:36:23.181 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 2>those are cool.</v>

3676
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:28.520
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is something to cover the tips of the fingers because as a</v>

3677
01:36:28.521 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu guy,</v>

3678
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.710
<v Speaker 2>like if I had like,</v>

3679
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:31.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3680
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.851
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

3681
01:36:31.851 --> 01:36:33.590
<v Speaker 2>you know those Everlast bag gloves,</v>

3682
01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:37.220
<v Speaker 2>you know those style they'd come over the tips like those aren't really going to</v>

3683
01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:42.080
<v Speaker 2>impede my grappling that much because I don't do this and I don't do this.</v>

3684
01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:42.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3685
01:36:42.381 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 2>you never,</v>

3686
01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:44.600
<v Speaker 2>you never know what I'm saying.</v>

3687
01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3688
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm showing something to honestly the people who were listening but interlacing</v>

3689
01:36:48.171 --> 01:36:48.651
<v Speaker 2>your fingers,</v>

3690
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:49.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't interlace your fingers.</v>

3691
01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 2>You grab and like an escrip or you grab and a gable grip and these grips that</v>

3692
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 2>you would do most of the really strong grips don't ever involve your fingers</v>

3693
01:36:58.191 --> 01:37:01.760
<v Speaker 2>sliding into the grooves and each other of the opposing fingers.</v>

3694
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

3695
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:06.290
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like something like that maybe could work where the tips of the</v>

3696
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:08.090
<v Speaker 2>fingers were covered up and it wouldn't,</v>

3697
01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:10.340
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't affect you as much if I poke somebody.</v>

3698
01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3699
01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3700
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 2>but what kind of like going into a dark territory here,</v>

3701
01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3702
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:21.140
<v Speaker 2>d having this experience and I wanted to get back to your peers because we</v>

3703
01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:21.291
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

3704
01:37:21.291 --> 01:37:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we really completely,</v>

3705
01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:23.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3706
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 2>we kind of got off track with that.</v>

3707
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Having these people stand outside and watch you do this.</v>

3708
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Was there,</v>

3709
01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3710
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:31.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3711
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:33.560
<v Speaker 2>the reaction very,</v>

3712
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:35.360
<v Speaker 2>or was it pretty,</v>

3713
01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.320
<v Speaker 2>pretty uniform or was there an extremes on both ends where people like,</v>

3714
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

3715
01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:41.151
<v Speaker 2>And other people were like,</v>

3716
01:37:41.151 --> 01:37:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I want to be like you.</v>

3717
01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

3718
01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if anybody was saying I want to be like you.</v>

3719
01:37:45.381 --> 01:37:46.214
<v Speaker 2>I doubt that.</v>

3720
01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3721
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.353
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3722
01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:48.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3723
01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what was said behind my back,</v>

3724
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:50.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3725
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:51.630
<v Speaker 2>here we got Charles Dylan,</v>

3726
01:37:51.670 --> 01:37:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

01:37:52.210 --> 01:37:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3728
01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:53.180
<v Speaker 2>can you believe this?</v>

3729
01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3730
01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:53.910
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

3731
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:54.743
<v Speaker 2>what a monster.</v>

3732
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:55.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3733
01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.361
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>

3734
01:37:57.361 --> 01:37:58.260
<v Speaker 2>people were cool about it.</v>

3735
01:37:58.261 --> 01:37:58.531
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3736
01:37:58.531 --> 01:37:58.741
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3737
01:37:58.741 --> 01:37:59.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3738
01:37:59.150 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3739
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:00.001
<v Speaker 2>to my nail,</v>

3740
01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3741
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:01.283
<v Speaker 2>they knew me,</v>

3742
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:01.951
<v Speaker 2>knew me,</v>

3743
01:38:01.951 --> 01:38:02.521
<v Speaker 2>and I knew,</v>

3744
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:03.354
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3745
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3746
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:04.950
<v Speaker 2>and I made light of it,</v>

3747
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:05.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3748
01:38:05.311 --> 01:38:05.980
<v Speaker 2>to me it was always,</v>

3749
01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.601
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

3750
01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:07.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3751
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 2>played it off in a sort of a humorous way as a,</v>

3752
01:38:09.571 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3753
01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.820
<v Speaker 2>basically me being fed to the lions,</v>

3754
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.863
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3755
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.733
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3756
01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:14.480
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

3757
01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.580
<v Speaker 2>the bigger for the bigger problem is in the wider professional.</v>

3758
01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.870
<v Speaker 2>People don't know me and you know,</v>

3759
01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:20.010
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3760
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.290
<v Speaker 2>so when those sort of people get Ahold of the book,</v>

3761
01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3762
01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:23.371
<v Speaker 2>I hope they read it,</v>

3763
01:38:23.371 --> 01:38:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3764
01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 2>because the book is,</v>

3765
01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3766
01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not really even about mixed more shorts,</v>

3767
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3768
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:32.850
<v Speaker 2>it's about using mixed martial arts as this bridge into big questions about</v>

3769
01:38:32.851 --> 01:38:33.684
<v Speaker 2>human behavior,</v>

3770
01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:38.690
<v Speaker 2>especially who in male behavior and the nature of masculinity and all the dumb</v>

3771
01:38:38.731 --> 01:38:39.690
<v Speaker 2>stuff we get up to.</v>

3772
01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the reasons I thought of you,</v>

3773
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:43.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3774
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:44.880
<v Speaker 2>as I was writing the book actually,</v>

3775
01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:45.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3776
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:45.551
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3777
01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3778
01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people write a book and they don't have anybody in mind for it to have</v>

3779
01:38:48.841 --> 01:38:49.180
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

3780
01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:49.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3781
01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.530
<v Speaker 2>a vague nebulous sense of who the readers are going to be.</v>

3782
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:53.491
<v Speaker 2>I never works for me.</v>

3783
01:38:53.491 --> 01:38:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I always have to think of an actual person,</v>

3784
01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3785
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:56.940
<v Speaker 2>who's going to read this book.</v>

3786
01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Like who would be the ideal reader for me.</v>

3787
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:59.663
<v Speaker 2>And for me it was you,</v>

3788
01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I thought you a lot when I was reading this book,</v>

3789
01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:02.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3790
01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:02.611
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>

3791
01:39:02.611 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 2>like who would be interested in this subject matter,</v>

3792
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3793
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>charitable and generous about it because these are things that uh,</v>

3794
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

3795
01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 2>you wonder about too and also sort of meshes with not only your interest in</v>

3796
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:14.281
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

3797
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 2>but your whole interest in human behavior and especially you're basically</v>

3798
01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:23.061
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary a outlook on human life and human behavior.</v>

3799
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what the book is really about.</v>

3800
01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:26.630
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of an evolutionary exploration of,</v>

3801
01:39:26.631 --> 01:39:26.860
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3802
01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:27.271
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

3803
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:28.410
<v Speaker 2>of the basis of,</v>

3804
01:39:28.411 --> 01:39:29.910
<v Speaker 2>of masculinity and manhood.</v>

3805
01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:30.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

3806
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.900
<v Speaker 2>that's a very interesting way of approaching it because I think that's one of</v>

3807
01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the issues that people have when it comes to the idea of mixed martial arts or</v>

3808
01:39:38.671 --> 01:39:43.671
<v Speaker 2>the idea of any sort of combat sport is that in embracing that and supporting it</v>

3809
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:49.230
<v Speaker 2>or in even just pursuing it somehow or another,</v>

3810
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>we're doing a disservice to the idea of a cultural evolution that we kind of all</v>

3811
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:54.780
<v Speaker 2>agree is going on.</v>

3812
01:39:55.170 --> 01:40:00.170
<v Speaker 2>If you compare society and human beings and our behavior today with what we know</v>

3813
01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.340
<v Speaker 2>about several thousands of years ago,</v>

3814
01:40:02.341 --> 01:40:04.590
<v Speaker 2>we know that we're in a far safer time,</v>

3815
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.240
<v Speaker 2>far more civil time,</v>

3816
01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3817
01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:09.210
<v Speaker 2>for the most part in most places of the world.</v>

3818
01:40:09.211 --> 01:40:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's exceptions,</v>

3819
01:40:10.321 --> 01:40:14.820
<v Speaker 2>but overwhelmingly the people that are communicating now we're communicating</v>

3820
01:40:14.821 --> 01:40:18.030
<v Speaker 2>about w we have an understanding about what we would call,</v>

3821
01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:18.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3822
01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 2>what they,</v>

3823
01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:22.170
<v Speaker 2>the super progressive to call toxic masculinity.</v>

3824
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:23.003
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3825
01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:23.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3826
01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:23.830
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

3827
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>and part of me,</v>

3828
01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.900
<v Speaker 2>part of me understands where they're coming from.</v>

3829
01:40:27.901 --> 01:40:29.930
<v Speaker 2>And part of me also thinks that where they're coming with their,</v>

3830
01:40:29.931 --> 01:40:32.810
<v Speaker 2>their kind of copping out and they're denying,</v>

3831
01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:36.810
<v Speaker 2>there's still denying certain aspects of their own life and their own</v>

3832
01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.570
<v Speaker 2>masculinity that maybe they,</v>

3833
01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:39.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3834
01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 2>they feel are weak and maybe they feel like they can't compete in these areas</v>

3835
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:45.600
<v Speaker 2>and they feel intimidated.</v>

3836
01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.920
<v Speaker 2>So they want to demean them.</v>

3837
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.900
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that's right either.</v>

3838
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.141
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3839
01:40:49.141 --> 01:40:49.974
<v Speaker 2>like there's some,</v>

3840
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:50.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3841
01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:52.170
<v Speaker 2>masculinity is complex,</v>

3842
01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:52.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3843
01:40:52.381 --> 01:40:53.214
<v Speaker 2>and it is there,</v>

3844
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 2>there are things about it.</v>

3845
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:55.271
<v Speaker 2>So it's femininity,</v>

3846
01:40:55.271 --> 01:40:55.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3847
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3848
01:40:55.890 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 2>was being a human being a human is a complex,</v>

3849
01:40:59.100 --> 01:40:59.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3850
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.951
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>

3851
01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:00.370
<v Speaker 2>And there are,</v>

3852
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:01.190
<v Speaker 2>there is something,</v>

3853
01:41:01.190 --> 01:41:06.190
<v Speaker 2>there is a case to be made that masculinity run a muck is the great problem of</v>

3854
01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

3855
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:08.081
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3856
01:41:08.081 --> 01:41:09.840
<v Speaker 2>no doubt that men's,</v>

3857
01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3858
01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:14.110
<v Speaker 2>tendencies towards aggression towards kind of silly forms of competition towards</v>

3859
01:41:14.111 --> 01:41:15.550
<v Speaker 2>physical forms of violence.</v>

3860
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3861
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:17.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3862
01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what's been the big problem all along.</v>

3863
01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Even though the world has gotten a lot safer,</v>

3864
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it's still may finish us off in the end.</v>

3865
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:23.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3866
01:41:23.561 --> 01:41:24.820
<v Speaker 2>that's the ultimate fear,</v>

3867
01:41:24.821 --> 01:41:25.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3868
01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:29.410
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate fear is that one dick waving contest will lead to nuclear war and</v>

3869
01:41:29.411 --> 01:41:31.420
<v Speaker 2>then we'll all be fucking so plausible.</v>

3870
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Knocking rocks together,</v>

3871
01:41:32.471 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>start fires.</v>

3872
01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So plausible,</v>

3873
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 2>especially look at some parts of the world,</v>

3874
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:39.310
<v Speaker 2>they were like fucking way closer than we are to Russia to chill.</v>

3875
01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at like what North Korea has threatened to do to South Korea,</v>

3876
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:44.230
<v Speaker 2>what Pakistan and India,</v>

3877
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:46.270
<v Speaker 2>when they look at each other and you mother Fucker,</v>

3878
01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I got a missile at your name on it.</v>

3879
01:41:48.490 --> 01:41:48.821
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>

3880
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:51.400
<v Speaker 2>All it takes is the wrong guy with the right amount of power.</v>

3881
01:41:51.401 --> 01:41:55.360
<v Speaker 2>And that can happen and it's very likely that we're saying guy for a reason.</v>

3882
01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be the wrong woman.</v>

3883
01:41:56.681 --> 01:41:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3884
01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:57.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3885
01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.061
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

3886
01:41:58.061 --> 01:41:58.894
<v Speaker 2>there is a certain,</v>

3887
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.490
<v Speaker 2>there's certain reality that,</v>

3888
01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.140
<v Speaker 2>but there's also certain reality to the fact that the reason why we have these</v>

3889
01:42:05.141 --> 01:42:06.790
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and ideas and the,</v>

3890
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:10.060
<v Speaker 2>that we have this quote unquote toxic masculinity in the first place is because</v>

3891
01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.040
<v Speaker 2>it served our genes well.</v>

3892
01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:16.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why we got to 2015 that's why we fought off the competition.</v>

3893
01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.550
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately,</v>

3894
01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a yin and a Yang to life.</v>

3895
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:24.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a give and a take and there's an action and a reaction when it comes to</v>

3896
01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:28.660
<v Speaker 2>aggression and when it comes to fear and danger and that,</v>

3897
01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:31.150
<v Speaker 2>that reaction is innovation.</v>

3898
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3899
01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:35.200
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing the safer aspects of society,</v>

3900
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.610
<v Speaker 2>law enforcement.</v>

3901
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.640
<v Speaker 2>There's all these different reactions to violence that lead to a better world.</v>

3902
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:42.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3903
01:42:42.641 --> 01:42:42.971
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

3904
01:42:42.971 --> 01:42:43.750
<v Speaker 2>and that's really,</v>

3905
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:44.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3906
01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:44.640
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

3907
01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 2>what the focus of my book is.</v>

3908
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:46.331
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3909
01:42:46.331 --> 01:42:46.411
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3910
01:42:46.411 --> 01:42:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3911
01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:46.871
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3912
01:42:46.871 --> 01:42:51.871
<v Speaker 2>I expected to write a book with MMA as a metaphor for this darkness is</v>

3913
01:42:52.271 --> 01:42:52.961
<v Speaker 2>blackness,</v>

3914
01:42:52.961 --> 01:42:53.711
<v Speaker 2>this danger,</v>

3915
01:42:53.711 --> 01:42:55.780
<v Speaker 2>this nastiness that the core of human nature.</v>

3916
01:42:55.781 --> 01:42:56.531
<v Speaker 2>That's what I expected.</v>

3917
01:42:56.531 --> 01:42:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a very different book than that.</v>

3918
01:42:58.330 --> 01:43:01.480
<v Speaker 2>The book ended up being a book about something that I call the monkey dance.</v>

3919
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3920
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:03.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3921
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3922
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:07.330
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever seen like a nature video of two elephants seals clashing and the</v>

3923
01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:11.110
<v Speaker 2>server for two mountain goats cracking skulls on a,</v>

3924
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:12.003
<v Speaker 2>on a hillside,</v>

3925
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 2>biologists call those sorts of contests.</v>

3926
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:15.760
<v Speaker 2>It call it ritual combat.</v>

3927
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3928
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:20.680
<v Speaker 2>and ritual combat is a way that a huge diversity of animal species have</v>

3929
01:43:20.681 --> 01:43:23.770
<v Speaker 2>developed to figure out who's bigger,</v>

3930
01:43:23.771 --> 01:43:24.551
<v Speaker 2>who's tougher,</v>

3931
01:43:24.551 --> 01:43:25.301
<v Speaker 2>who's stronger,</v>

3932
01:43:25.301 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 2>who's fitter without fighting it out to the bitter bloody.</v>

3933
01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:32.080
<v Speaker 2>And like chimps grab sticks and they pulled them out of the ground.</v>

3934
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:35.140
<v Speaker 2>They beat the shit out of trees with them more than people fight.</v>

3935
01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3936
01:43:35.890 --> 01:43:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3937
01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.093
<v Speaker 2>So Kim's have,</v>

3938
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:38.350
<v Speaker 2>and that's the monkey dance.</v>

3939
01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3940
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.150
<v Speaker 2>and so in humans or animals too,</v>

3941
01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 2>most people seem to like to forget this,</v>

3942
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Speaker 2>but what we're animals too,</v>

3943
01:43:44.771 --> 01:43:46.720
<v Speaker 2>we're complex animals were cultured animals.</v>

3944
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:47.890
<v Speaker 2>We're animals still.</v>

3945
01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 2>And the monkey dance is my name for human versions of ritual</v>

3946
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.023
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

3947
01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3948
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and it's a broad diversity of things.</v>

3949
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Mainly men get up to things like a deadly duals and verbal tools,</v>

3950
01:43:59.770 --> 01:44:00.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3951
01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>play fights among boys.</v>

3952
01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:01.931
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3953
01:44:01.931 --> 01:44:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's especially a sports.</v>

3954
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of these behaviors,</v>

3955
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>the key things that a lot of these behaviors seem silly.</v>

3956
01:44:09.261 --> 01:44:10.130
<v Speaker 1>They seem stupid.</v>

3957
01:44:10.131 --> 01:44:13.130
<v Speaker 1>They seem pathetic there often volatile,</v>

3958
01:44:13.131 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and they are in danger of escalating to something truly dangerous.</v>

3959
01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:16.980
<v Speaker 1>But on the whole,</v>

3960
01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:18.880
<v Speaker 1>these monkey dances are a good thing there.</v>

3961
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 1>A way that men can work out their problems,</v>

3962
01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 1>thrash out their status,</v>

3963
01:44:23.241 --> 01:44:27.050
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in ways that fall short of Apps,</v>

3964
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:27.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3965
01:44:27.291 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 1>all that allowed sorts of violence.</v>

3966
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So the tips are a great example of this.</v>

3967
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:31.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3968
01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 1>and humans do exactly the same thing.</v>

3969
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.910
<v Speaker 1>If you're at a bar and you knock shoulders with somebody and somebody spills</v>

3970
01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:38.773
<v Speaker 1>their beer,</v>

3971
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3972
01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:39.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3973
01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:40.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3974
01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:41.720
<v Speaker 1>it's likely to go down like this.</v>

3975
01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:43.960
<v Speaker 1>There'll be some sort of insult us with some sort of challenge them.</v>

3976
01:44:43.961 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 1>World Women feel disrespected,</v>

3977
01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:46.490
<v Speaker 1>dishonored,</v>

3978
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:47.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3979
01:44:47.001 --> 01:44:48.860
<v Speaker 1>they'll bluster back and forth.</v>

3980
01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Does that goes chimps in the jungle.</v>

3981
01:44:50.301 --> 01:44:52.100
<v Speaker 1>But at some 0.1 of the guys is like,</v>

3982
01:44:52.101 --> 01:44:53.180
<v Speaker 1>can I want to do this?</v>

3983
01:44:53.181 --> 01:44:53.691
<v Speaker 1>And you'll say,</v>

3984
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

3985
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.870
<v Speaker 1>or you'll or you'll walk away.</v>

3986
01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3987
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:58.243
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't,</v>

3988
01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:59.930
<v Speaker 1>it continues to escalate.</v>

3989
01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.110
<v Speaker 1>The guys will close the distance.</v>

3990
01:45:01.111 --> 01:45:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So push the punch or tackle the cow.</v>

3991
01:45:03.190 --> 01:45:05.230
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a totally different sort of situation then.</v>

3992
01:45:05.231 --> 01:45:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Then competition when nowhere we're talking about when you're talking about</v>

3993
01:45:08.531 --> 01:45:09.131
<v Speaker 3>bars,</v>

3994
01:45:09.131 --> 01:45:10.930
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about social things.</v>

3995
01:45:11.290 --> 01:45:12.480
<v Speaker 3>They talking about carve.</v>

3996
01:45:12.481 --> 01:45:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3997
01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:14.013
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

3998
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.040
<v Speaker 3>no one knows.</v>

3999
01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:15.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4000
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:16.690
<v Speaker 3>when you bumped into a guy in a bar,</v>

4001
01:45:16.691 --> 01:45:18.100
<v Speaker 3>you don't know who the fuck you're dealing with.</v>

4002
01:45:18.101 --> 01:45:19.240
<v Speaker 3>You don't know anything about it.</v>

4003
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4004
01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.160
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

4005
01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a matter of a lot of chest puffing and a lot of posturing and usually</v>

4006
01:45:24.491 --> 01:45:25.870
<v Speaker 3>enough sometimes.</v>

4007
01:45:26.110 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

4008
01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:29.050
<v Speaker 3>what my take on it is,</v>

4009
01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:29.950
<v Speaker 3>is that there's a big,</v>

4010
01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:34.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a big difference between that and what guys are doing to establish</v>

4011
01:45:35.110 --> 01:45:35.943
<v Speaker 3>greatness,</v>

4012
01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:36.940
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing too.</v>

4013
01:45:36.941 --> 01:45:39.220
<v Speaker 3>When you achieve greatness in martial arts,</v>

4014
01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:44.340
<v Speaker 3>what you're essentially doing by becoming a champion is you're showing a genetic</v>

4015
01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:46.090
<v Speaker 3>superiority.</v>

4016
01:45:46.091 --> 01:45:47.800
<v Speaker 3>You're sewing a mental superiority,</v>

4017
01:45:47.801 --> 01:45:52.801
<v Speaker 3>a character superiority that makes you more preferred for breeding.</v>

4018
01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:53.591
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4019
01:45:53.591 --> 01:45:55.270
<v Speaker 3>that's just the reality situation.</v>

4020
01:45:55.271 --> 01:45:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Like I joke around about it,</v>

4021
01:45:56.291 --> 01:45:57.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's Kinda true.</v>

4022
01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.020
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why anybody gets laid his,</v>

4023
01:45:59.021 --> 01:46:00.830
<v Speaker 3>cause Luke Rockhold didn't get there first.</v>

4024
01:46:00.831 --> 01:46:01.720
<v Speaker 3>So that was the greatest line.</v>

4025
01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:02.770
<v Speaker 3>And it's completely true.</v>

4026
01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:03.700
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>

4027
01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.470
<v Speaker 3>My wife would have little rock hold babies.</v>

4028
01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.593
<v Speaker 3>She could,</v>

4029
01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.260
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to admit that,</v>

4030
01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:08.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4031
01:46:08.531 --> 01:46:13.210
<v Speaker 3>because nobody wants to admit that no man was not into that.</v>

4032
01:46:13.211 --> 01:46:14.380
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just the way he looks,</v>

4033
01:46:14.381 --> 01:46:15.910
<v Speaker 3>it's that he is that guy.</v>

4034
01:46:15.970 --> 01:46:16.301
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>

4035
01:46:16.301 --> 01:46:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So we all,</v>

4036
01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:20.010
<v Speaker 3>we have an organic vegan garden together and we,</v>

4037
01:46:20.011 --> 01:46:20.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4038
01:46:20.181 --> 01:46:21.260
<v Speaker 3>we were amazingly connected.</v>

4039
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Your wife wants to fuck Luke Rockhold is deal with it.</v>

4040
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:24.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4041
01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:25.011
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>

4042
01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean when it comes right down to it and you walk around in the world and you</v>

4043
01:46:27.771 --> 01:46:31.430
<v Speaker 1>see these differences between men and women and you see physical differences,</v>

4044
01:46:31.431 --> 01:46:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you see behavioral differences and you naturally asking where does all this</v>

4045
01:46:34.371 --> 01:46:35.204
<v Speaker 1>stuff coming from?</v>

4046
01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:37.730
<v Speaker 1>And part of it comes from culture.</v>

4047
01:46:37.731 --> 01:46:38.630
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

4048
01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:39.201
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4049
01:46:39.201 --> 01:46:40.034
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it is,</v>

4050
01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:41.180
<v Speaker 1>is biology.</v>

4051
01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.410
<v Speaker 3>It's total biology.</v>

4052
01:46:42.411 --> 01:46:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Women aren't showing up at hospitals trying to fuck dudes right before they die.</v>

4053
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:48.750
<v Speaker 3>They're not trying to pull their dicks out whether coffin blood,</v>

4054
01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.600
<v Speaker 2>he just something about you're so vulnerable.</v>

4055
01:46:51.601 --> 01:46:52.434
<v Speaker 2>I need you inside me.</v>

4056
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

4057
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:54.390
<v Speaker 2>this is not what they do.</v>

4058
01:46:54.391 --> 01:46:54.591
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

4059
01:46:54.591 --> 01:46:58.650
<v Speaker 2>they're attracted by power and strength and character and not just strength as</v>

4060
01:46:58.651 --> 01:47:00.960
<v Speaker 2>far as like the ability to oppress other people.</v>

4061
01:47:00.961 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Like we traditionally look at those things,</v>

4062
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 2>or it's in vogue to look at those masculine characteristics as being negative.</v>

4063
01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:13.170
<v Speaker 2>You know that Europe you're oppressing others are the toxic masculinity handle,</v>

4064
01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:16.590
<v Speaker 2>but she's choosing a good hunter and a good provider,</v>

4065
01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 2>but also someone productive who can deal when the shit goes down.</v>

4066
01:47:20.130 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes,</v>

4067
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:21.811
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4068
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 2>you know when they'll,</v>

4069
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:27.410
<v Speaker 2>they'll chirp all around about toxic masculinity or negative male behavior or,</v>

4070
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.750
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is they don't have any fucking character.</v>

4071
01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And if something happens really bad in their life,</v>

4072
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:34.610
<v Speaker 2>they start weeping and they fall apart.</v>

4073
01:47:34.611 --> 01:47:35.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's unattractive.</v>

4074
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:38.130
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it's unattractive to your friends,</v>

4075
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:40.290
<v Speaker 2>if you have a friend and every time something goes wrong in his life,</v>

4076
01:47:40.291 --> 01:47:41.520
<v Speaker 2>he starts crying and he wants a hug.</v>

4077
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

4078
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:42.361
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

4079
01:47:42.361 --> 01:47:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Bitch,</v>

4080
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.130
<v Speaker 2>get your fucking shit together.</v>

4081
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Come on dude.</v>

4082
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:46.043
<v Speaker 2>And that's how,</v>

4083
01:47:46.290 --> 01:47:49.230
<v Speaker 2>that's how you're supposed to feel because you know that that guy,</v>

4084
01:47:49.231 --> 01:47:50.430
<v Speaker 2>if anything goes wrong,</v>

4085
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:53.580
<v Speaker 2>that guy's not going to be a good ally.</v>

4086
01:47:53.581 --> 01:47:54.420
<v Speaker 2>He's not a good ally.</v>

4087
01:47:54.421 --> 01:47:55.980
<v Speaker 2>He's not good to have in the tribe.</v>

4088
01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:01.460
<v Speaker 2>And these are unfortunate but realistic aspects of being a human being.</v>

4089
01:48:01.771 --> 01:48:02.850
<v Speaker 2>In the 21st century.</v>

4090
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:04.290
<v Speaker 2>It's still there.</v>

4091
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's still there.</v>

4092
01:48:05.251 --> 01:48:05.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4093
01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:09.720
<v Speaker 2>one day we might come to some point when we have so much control over the world</v>

4094
01:48:09.721 --> 01:48:10.470
<v Speaker 2>that we live in,</v>

4095
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 2>that masculinity won't be unnecessary.</v>

4096
01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:13.500
<v Speaker 2>And that that's the case.</v>

4097
01:48:13.710 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 2>We'll probably evolve to the point where we look like the aliens that are</v>

4098
01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:20.070
<v Speaker 2>depicted in every movie with a giant hand muscles,</v>

4099
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:20.791
<v Speaker 2>no muscles,</v>

4100
01:48:20.791 --> 01:48:23.930
<v Speaker 2>and the giant head that uses telekinesis to move things.</v>

4101
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:24.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4102
01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 2>that's probably where we're headed.</v>

4103
01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4104
01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:26.731
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4105
01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:27.150
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

4106
01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:27.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4107
01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:29.940
<v Speaker 2>the world has gotten softer and softer and safer and safer and we're still,</v>

4108
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:30.803
<v Speaker 2>we're still,</v>

4109
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:31.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4110
01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:33.030
<v Speaker 2>carrying this baggage,</v>

4111
01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.980
<v Speaker 2>this evolutionary baggage of a,</v>

4112
01:48:34.981 --> 01:48:39.510
<v Speaker 2>of a sort of masculinity that's best suited to a world where,</v>

4113
01:48:39.511 --> 01:48:39.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4114
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:42.810
<v Speaker 2>there's barbarians at the gates and bears in the woods and uh,</v>

4115
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:43.410
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

4116
01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:44.280
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

4117
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:46.170
<v Speaker 2>But in this same world,</v>

4118
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.250
<v Speaker 2>there are avenues to express this maximum masculinity where you can be</v>

4119
01:48:50.251 --> 01:48:51.930
<v Speaker 2>completely civil,</v>

4120
01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 2>when you can be completely kind,</v>

4121
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:55.200
<v Speaker 2>you can be a generous person,</v>

4122
01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:59.190
<v Speaker 2>but get over your own genetics in a way.</v>

4123
01:48:59.191 --> 01:49:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Give yourself difficult tasks to do.</v>

4124
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:03.090
<v Speaker 2>And even what we were talking about earlier,</v>

4125
01:49:03.091 --> 01:49:04.650
<v Speaker 2>fucking yoga can do that.</v>

4126
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:08.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be beating the shit out of each other in a cave two and a</v>

4127
01:49:08.731 --> 01:49:09.900
<v Speaker 2>cage to achieve this,</v>

4128
01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:10.720
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4129
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.410
<v Speaker 2>but the victory over your own self.</v>

4130
01:49:13.410 --> 01:49:14.101
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

4131
01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4132
01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:14.881
<v Speaker 2>That's what I,</v>

4133
01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:15.960
<v Speaker 2>that's why I didn't know going in.</v>

4134
01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:17.030
<v Speaker 2>That's why I didn't know going in.</v>

4135
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I figured,</v>

4136
01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I figured those guys must like beating people up.</v>

4137
01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:21.813
<v Speaker 2>It's muscle muscle.</v>

4138
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I think some do take Abbott.</v>

4139
01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 2>It comes to mind when I think of the UFC level,</v>

4140
01:49:25.770 --> 01:49:27.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's more of those guys,</v>

4141
01:49:27.241 --> 01:49:28.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know I'm,</v>

4142
01:49:28.371 --> 01:49:28.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4143
01:49:28.641 --> 01:49:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this very small time.</v>

4144
01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Amateur fighters and western Pennsylvania and Ohio,</v>

4145
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.090
<v Speaker 2>a 99% of them are amateurs.</v>

4146
01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.380
<v Speaker 2>99% of them have no hope of ever winning any fame or fortune there.</v>

4147
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:43.050
<v Speaker 2>There is no fame or fortune to be one.</v>

4148
01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.070
<v Speaker 2>So why are they doing it?</v>

4149
01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it because they want a challenge in their,</v>

4150
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 2>they want a quest</v>

4151
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.940
<v Speaker 3>in their life and they want to do battle with their own weakness in their own</v>

4152
01:49:51.941 --> 01:49:53.440
<v Speaker 3>timidity and tried to defeat it.</v>

4153
01:49:53.610 --> 01:49:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Then you're not dreaming about hurting people.</v>

4154
01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:57.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to express it.</v>

4155
01:49:57.251 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Do battle with their own weakness.</v>

4156
01:49:58.810 --> 01:49:59.920
<v Speaker 3>That's why we,</v>

4157
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:01.300
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>

4158
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:04.990
<v Speaker 3>we have disdain for people that pick on folks that they know that they can beat.</v>

4159
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:09.580
<v Speaker 3>If you see a guy and he's a bully and he's like a 250 pound guy and he wants to</v>

4160
01:50:09.581 --> 01:50:10.660
<v Speaker 3>fight a hundred pound guy,</v>

4161
01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:11.800
<v Speaker 3>why is you want to do that?</v>

4162
01:50:11.801 --> 01:50:14.290
<v Speaker 3>He wants to do that cause he's scared of a challenge cause he's a coward.</v>

4163
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4164
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll read a 250 pound man would never want,</v>

4165
01:50:17.651 --> 01:50:21.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean the only time you would threaten a hundred pound man is that a hundred</v>

4166
01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 3>pound man was threatening a hundred pound woman or something or the other</v>

4167
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:24.020
<v Speaker 3>hundred pound man.</v>

4168
01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.710
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to step in and keep the peace,</v>

4169
01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:28.300
<v Speaker 3>but when you see a bully look,</v>

4170
01:50:28.301 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most disgusting characteristics because we know ultimately it's</v>

4171
01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:32.080
<v Speaker 3>cowardice.</v>

4172
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Cowardice.</v>

4173
01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.190
<v Speaker 3>It appears his strength because they're flaunting their superiority,</v>

4174
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:37.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's really cowardice.</v>

4175
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4176
01:50:38.230 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 3>and that's a thing that's going to come somebody their own size.</v>

4177
01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:42.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4178
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:42.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4179
01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:43.060
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

4180
01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:43.990
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example,</v>

4181
01:50:43.991 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 3>there was a fighter that fell out of a card,</v>

4182
01:50:46.330 --> 01:50:47.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4183
01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.680
<v Speaker 3>cause he got injured and they offered this other fighter replacement and he</v>

4184
01:50:50.681 --> 01:50:50.891
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

4185
01:50:50.891 --> 01:50:51.101
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4186
01:50:51.101 --> 01:50:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fight that guy.</v>

4187
01:50:52.151 --> 01:50:56.890
<v Speaker 3>But then he listed off a bunch of guys that he would fight that we're like way</v>

4188
01:50:56.891 --> 01:50:57.730
<v Speaker 3>below him.</v>

4189
01:50:57.731 --> 01:50:58.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4190
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.891
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4191
01:50:58.891 --> 01:50:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4192
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.800
<v Speaker 3>and his,</v>

4193
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:00.551
<v Speaker 3>his idea was like,</v>

4194
01:51:00.551 --> 01:51:00.791
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4195
01:51:00.791 --> 01:51:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I have to change a opponents and four weeks.</v>

4196
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:04.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to be difficult.</v>

4197
01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.730
<v Speaker 3>And everybody was like big,</v>

4198
01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.010
<v Speaker 3>like the mixed martial arts,</v>

4199
01:51:09.011 --> 01:51:09.970
<v Speaker 3>the underground forum.</v>

4200
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking a wash with people angry.</v>

4201
01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And they're right.</v>

4202
01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:14.740
<v Speaker 3>They are right.</v>

4203
01:51:14.741 --> 01:51:15.574
<v Speaker 3>They are right.</v>

4204
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4205
01:51:16.091 --> 01:51:20.050
<v Speaker 3>either you are willing to fight another top contender who's just as capable of</v>

4206
01:51:20.051 --> 01:51:21.790
<v Speaker 3>beating you as you are of him.</v>

4207
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Or we're wasting fucking time here,</v>

4208
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:24.730
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4209
01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:26.050
<v Speaker 3>And we don't want to watch that.</v>

4210
01:51:26.110 --> 01:51:28.570
<v Speaker 3>You've got to understand like what did you sign up to do?</v>

4211
01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.430
<v Speaker 3>You signed up to be a fucking gladiator.</v>

4212
01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:31.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4213
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
<v Speaker 3>You signed up to be the most noble of all martial arts combatants of all time.</v>

4214
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.970
<v Speaker 3>You're competing at the highest level we've ever achieved in Marshall,</v>

4215
01:51:39.971 --> 01:51:40.481
<v Speaker 3>like today.</v>

4216
01:51:40.481 --> 01:51:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Make no mistake about it.</v>

4217
01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:45.010
<v Speaker 3>The fighters of today are the highest skilled,</v>

4218
01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:48.970
<v Speaker 3>the most competent martial artists that have ever existed.</v>

4219
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:52.180
<v Speaker 3>There's some been some great judo because of the past.</v>

4220
01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:56.530
<v Speaker 3>There's been some great taekwondo competitors and great Moitai fighters has been</v>

4221
01:51:56.531 --> 01:51:57.250
<v Speaker 3>great fun.</v>

4222
01:51:57.250 --> 01:52:01.810
<v Speaker 3>But as far as like the overall combination in the form of a mixed martial artist</v>

4223
01:52:01.811 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

4224
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.090
<v Speaker 3>they're the best that they've ever been.</v>

4225
01:52:04.210 --> 01:52:05.140
<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>

4226
01:52:05.141 --> 01:52:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I've by orders of magnitude.</v>

4227
01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:07.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4228
01:52:07.451 --> 01:52:07.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4229
01:52:07.721 --> 01:52:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm a student of this.</v>

4230
01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:09.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean a long,</v>

4231
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:10.990
<v Speaker 3>a lifelong student.</v>

4232
01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I've been deeply involved in martial arts and I was 14 years old,</v>

4233
01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:16.011
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

4234
01:52:16.011 --> 01:52:16.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

4235
01:52:16.221 --> 01:52:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I've seen all the levels.</v>

4236
01:52:17.411 --> 01:52:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the difference.</v>

4237
01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:24.300
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between someone who is doing it to achieve greatness and a</v>

4238
01:52:24.551 --> 01:52:28.510
<v Speaker 3>difference to someone who's like barely getting by and they're really physically</v>

4239
01:52:28.511 --> 01:52:31.360
<v Speaker 3>talented and they train really hard,</v>

4240
01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:33.670
<v Speaker 3>but they're fucking terrified of a real challenge.</v>

4241
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:37.690
<v Speaker 3>And those guys exist and they exist even at a very high level because they're</v>

4242
01:52:37.691 --> 01:52:37.960
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>

4243
01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.070
<v Speaker 3>they come from really good camps,</v>

4244
01:52:39.071 --> 01:52:40.150
<v Speaker 3>they're really well trained.</v>

4245
01:52:40.151 --> 01:52:40.780
<v Speaker 3>And they have,</v>

4246
01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:41.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4247
01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.700
<v Speaker 3>they have a bunch of success under their belt,</v>

4248
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:44.030
<v Speaker 3>but they're always terrified.</v>

4249
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 3>The one guy who is going to expose them.</v>

4250
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

4251
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the most fascinating aspects.</v>

4252
01:52:48.190 --> 01:52:49.820
<v Speaker 2>It's also bad business to lose.</v>

4253
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4254
01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:50.931
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4255
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:51.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4256
01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:51.960
<v Speaker 2>those boxers you know,</v>

4257
01:52:51.961 --> 01:52:52.330
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

4258
01:52:52.330 --> 01:52:55.730
<v Speaker 2>are notorious for padding their records and fighting tomato cans.</v>

4259
01:52:55.731 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 2>And there's also,</v>

4260
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.240
<v Speaker 2>there's some guys that fold under pressure.</v>

4261
01:52:59.241 --> 01:53:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most impressive things about Jon Jones.</v>

4262
01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4263
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>is it Jon Jones has overcome adversity in his career in a,</v>

4264
01:53:07.611 --> 01:53:08.480
<v Speaker 2>in a very,</v>

4265
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:11.810
<v Speaker 2>very obvious character defining way.</v>

4266
01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Like a good example is the fight with Gustafson.</v>

4267
01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.300
<v Speaker 2>He talked to the people that are in John's camp.</v>

4268
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.781
<v Speaker 2>They'll tell you,</v>

4269
01:53:17.781 --> 01:53:17.961
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4270
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 2>he barely trained for that fight to barely trained for him.</v>

4271
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:21.830
<v Speaker 2>But God,</v>

4272
01:53:21.831 --> 01:53:24.230
<v Speaker 2>he did out in those last rounds and,</v>

4273
01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:25.490
<v Speaker 2>and saved his title.</v>

4274
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.770
<v Speaker 2>The Vitor Belfort fight is another perfect example.</v>

4275
01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Veto caught him and out fucking deep armbar.</v>

4276
01:53:30.650 --> 01:53:32.700
<v Speaker 2>His arm was totally hyperextended.</v>

4277
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:37.750
<v Speaker 2>99% of the population on this planet plus who it tap.</v>

4278
01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm tapping to thinking about it.</v>

4279
01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was fucked up.</v>

4280
01:53:40.731 --> 01:53:40.971
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

4281
01:53:40.971 --> 01:53:43.610
<v Speaker 2>his elbow was fucked up for a long time after that too,</v>

4282
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.580
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why he had to coach the ultimate fighter and wound</v>

4283
01:53:46.581 --> 01:53:46.731
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

4284
01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:46.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4285
01:53:46.971 --> 01:53:50.720
<v Speaker 2>going through that because he really couldn't compete is it was jacked.</v>

4286
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:52.280
<v Speaker 2>His elbow was fucking jagged,</v>

4287
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:53.600
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't have,</v>

4288
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:55.400
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't tap and he went on to win that fight.</v>

4289
01:53:55.401 --> 01:53:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Anyone on the winded by submission,</v>

4290
01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:00.770
<v Speaker 2>he submitted a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu in Vito Belfort.</v>

4291
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4292
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I just think that that quality is something that is almost impossible to teach.</v>

4293
01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you either have it or you don't,</v>

4294
01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:12.800
<v Speaker 2>or you maybe you can gain it if you didn't have it.</v>

4295
01:54:12.801 --> 01:54:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can put up these boundaries in your mind where you,</v>

4296
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you won't quit any more.</v>

4297
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:20.350
<v Speaker 2>You won't allow you to some,</v>

4298
01:54:20.490 --> 01:54:20.990
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

4299
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4300
01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:22.910
<v Speaker 2>native element to it.</v>

4301
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:23.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4302
01:54:23.061 --> 01:54:23.361
<v Speaker 2>some of it,</v>

4303
01:54:23.361 --> 01:54:27.710
<v Speaker 2>some people are born tough and born with that kind of character horn.</v>

4304
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's developed over the course of the adversity that you faced in your</v>

4305
01:54:31.041 --> 01:54:31.311
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

4306
01:54:31.311 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

4307
01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

4308
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:33.590
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4309
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:37.130
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the big findings for me at the gym is like,</v>

4310
01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:37.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4311
01:54:37.551 --> 01:54:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you go into the gym and it's like,</v>

4312
01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:39.500
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4313
01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.680
<v Speaker 2>what's a fighter and promote people.</v>

4314
01:54:41.681 --> 01:54:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I think most people think a fighter is like,</v>

4315
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I dunno person is strong and fit and has developed this tool kit.</v>

4316
01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4317
01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:47.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4318
01:54:47.230 --> 01:54:49.160
<v Speaker 2>all these sophisticated techniques and all that stuff,</v>

4319
01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 2>but should talk to fighters.</v>

4320
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.230
<v Speaker 2>They don't define a fighter that way.</v>

4321
01:54:52.231 --> 01:54:53.210
<v Speaker 2>It just find it a fighter is,</v>

4322
01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:53.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4323
01:54:53.361 --> 01:54:57.800
<v Speaker 2>a person who's really tough and who will fight and whose game and a fight.</v>

4324
01:54:58.210 --> 01:54:59.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4325
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:03.710
<v Speaker 2>and that was one the thing that I found sort of interesting going in because one</v>

4326
01:55:03.711 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 2>of my,</v>

4327
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.440
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I wondered about was whether I'd be able to do it,</v>

4328
01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.020
<v Speaker 2>just go in there and a square off with people.</v>

4329
01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I was ever going to be good at it,</v>

4330
01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:11.700
<v Speaker 2>but could I just kind,</v>

4331
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I compete bravely and I,</v>

4332
01:55:13.771 --> 01:55:17.900
<v Speaker 2>and I do think that you do build your character by doing it.</v>

4333
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:18.400
<v Speaker 2>You do get,</v>

4334
01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 2>you do get stronger and tougher and braver,</v>

4335
01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.333
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4336
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:23.600
<v Speaker 2>through the process of,</v>

4337
01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:24.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4338
01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 2>of training?</v>

4339
01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:26.031
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4340
01:55:26.031 --> 01:55:26.451
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

4341
01:55:26.451 --> 01:55:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Do I think there's no doubt about that.</v>

4342
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:29.750
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also,</v>

4343
01:55:29.751 --> 01:55:29.891
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4344
01:55:29.891 --> 01:55:34.891
<v Speaker 2>it's curious to me that there's a bunch of people that are fight fans that are</v>

4345
01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.790
<v Speaker 2>they and even fighters that don't respect people that don't put themselves at</v>

4346
01:55:40.791 --> 01:55:41.624
<v Speaker 2>risk</v>

4347
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:44.910
<v Speaker 2>like a Floyd Mayweather as a perfect example.</v>

4348
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that at all.</v>

4349
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it at all either.</v>

4350
01:55:47.431 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I look at Floyd Mayweather and I see a genius.</v>

4351
01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I see a guy who's obviously troubled in his personal life and his treatment of</v>

4352
01:55:54.121 --> 01:55:56.190
<v Speaker 2>women is atrocious and all that,</v>

4353
01:55:56.191 --> 01:55:56.910
<v Speaker 2>all of the above.</v>

4354
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:57.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4355
01:55:57.121 --> 01:55:59.550
<v Speaker 2>he's got all these arrests for domestic violence.</v>

4356
01:55:59.551 --> 01:55:59.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4357
01:55:59.731 --> 01:56:00.331
<v Speaker 2>where there's smoke,</v>

4358
01:56:00.331 --> 01:56:00.871
<v Speaker 2>there's fire,</v>

4359
01:56:00.871 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4360
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.501
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4361
01:56:01.501 --> 01:56:03.520
<v Speaker 2>he spent time in jail for that gotta be,</v>

4362
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:06.900
<v Speaker 2>or he's hanging out with chicks that everyone and anyone would smack.</v>

4363
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:07.860
<v Speaker 2>That's possibility too,</v>

4364
01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 2>that nobody wants to take into consideration.</v>

4365
01:56:10.370 --> 01:56:10.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4366
01:56:10.621 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 2>you're hanging around with that dude.</v>

4367
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:11.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4368
01:56:11.881 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 2>why are you hanging around with that dude?</v>

4369
01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4370
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:13.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4371
01:56:13.951 --> 01:56:14.131
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4372
01:56:14.131 --> 01:56:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you're attracted to him while he's rich.</v>

4373
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:16.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4374
01:56:16.201 --> 01:56:17.034
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

4375
01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

4376
01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what,</v>

4377
01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 2>what the variables are?</v>

4378
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:22.050
<v Speaker 2>But what's undeniable,</v>

4379
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:22.291
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4380
01:56:22.291 --> 01:56:22.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him.</v>

4381
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to judge his character.</v>

4382
01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:29.010
<v Speaker 2>What's undeniable about what you can view is inside the ring.</v>

4383
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:30.240
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking genius.</v>

4384
01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:31.470
<v Speaker 2>He's brilliant.</v>

4385
01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:33.060
<v Speaker 2>The way he gets guys to dance,</v>

4386
01:56:33.061 --> 01:56:33.930
<v Speaker 2>to his tune,</v>

4387
01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 2>he slows punchers down.</v>

4388
01:56:35.851 --> 01:56:38.700
<v Speaker 2>He slows volume punches down dramatically.</v>

4389
01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:39.380
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4390
01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:40.890
<v Speaker 2>he gets them to second.</v>

4391
01:56:40.890 --> 01:56:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Guess what they're doing.</v>

4392
01:56:41.971 --> 01:56:43.830
<v Speaker 2>He gets them off their game.</v>

4393
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:45.330
<v Speaker 2>He lights them up,</v>

4394
01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.111
<v Speaker 2>he tags them,</v>

4395
01:56:46.111 --> 01:56:46.970
<v Speaker 2>he clinches them.</v>

4396
01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 2>He just fights brilliantly.</v>

4397
01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:48.841
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4398
01:56:48.841 --> 01:56:51.840
<v Speaker 2>the whole point of fighting is to do damage without getting damaged.</v>

4399
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:53.160
<v Speaker 2>But he doesn't do that much damage.</v>

4400
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:54.210
<v Speaker 2>That's why people get crazy.</v>

4401
01:56:54.230 --> 01:56:54.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4402
01:56:54.391 --> 01:56:55.590
<v Speaker 2>He does a little bit of damage,</v>

4403
01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:56.860
<v Speaker 2>but score than anybody else.</v>

4404
01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.460
<v Speaker 2>But in doing so,</v>

4405
01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:01.080
<v Speaker 2>he's beat the fucking game.</v>

4406
01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:02.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4407
01:57:02.041 --> 01:57:04.060
<v Speaker 2>he's 48 and oh yeah.</v>

4408
01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:06.120
<v Speaker 2>And he's never been knocked down.</v>

4409
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 2>He's never been stopped.</v>

4410
01:57:07.561 --> 01:57:08.730
<v Speaker 2>He's never been really hurt.</v>

4411
01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:08.971
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

4412
01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 2>been knocked down.</v>

4413
01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's been knocked down.</v>

4414
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.570
<v Speaker 2>It might've been knocked down like early in his career.</v>

4415
01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I think people were reacting.</v>

4416
01:57:14.311 --> 01:57:15.870
<v Speaker 2>They're not to the lack of,</v>

4417
01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:16.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4418
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:17.190
<v Speaker 2>carnage.</v>

4419
01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I think going back to the lack of drama,</v>

4420
01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4421
01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:19.950
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

4422
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:20.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4423
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.870
<v Speaker 2>people are attracted to fighting sports.</v>

4424
01:57:21.871 --> 01:57:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I think for a lot of reasons.</v>

4425
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:23.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4426
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:26.250
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a creature in us that kind of likes violence.</v>

4427
01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4428
01:57:27.210 --> 01:57:31.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's also this sort of a drama to a fight that's hard.</v>

4429
01:57:31.531 --> 01:57:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean with that fight you have these two guys.</v>

4430
01:57:33.451 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the,</v>

4431
01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:34.541
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>

4432
01:57:34.541 --> 01:57:35.430
<v Speaker 2>you have the good guy,</v>

4433
01:57:35.431 --> 01:57:35.881
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>

4434
01:57:35.881 --> 01:57:36.691
<v Speaker 2>you have the face,</v>

4435
01:57:36.691 --> 01:57:40.860
<v Speaker 2>you have the heel squaring off in this incredibly climactic showdown that's</v>

4436
01:57:40.861 --> 01:57:45.210
<v Speaker 2>going to define the story of their entire careers and you're expecting some sort</v>

4437
01:57:45.211 --> 01:57:49.860
<v Speaker 2>of epic battle to go down that's going to be incredibly gripping drama.</v>

4438
01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:53.040
<v Speaker 2>And then as a sort of dramatic spectacle,</v>

4439
01:57:53.041 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it sort of fell flat because why?</v>

4440
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:59.090
<v Speaker 2>That's my sort of theory for why the,</v>

4441
01:57:59.150 --> 01:57:59.371
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4442
01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:01.230
<v Speaker 2>the reaction to the fight was so negative.</v>

4443
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4444
01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:03.241
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

4445
01:58:03.241 --> 01:58:03.720
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4446
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean just when you're dealing with two of the best boxers of any generation</v>

4447
01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.870
<v Speaker 2>who I think Manny Pacquiao,</v>

4448
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's safe to say that 95% of them don't know anything about boxing.</v>

4449
01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:16.920
<v Speaker 2>That is a problem.</v>

4450
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Boxing fans,</v>

4451
01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:19.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a Roger Mayweather.</v>

4452
01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:20.850
<v Speaker 2>He says famously it's a quote.</v>

4453
01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't know shit about Bach ever seen they say that.</v>

4454
01:58:23.851 --> 01:58:24.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4455
01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:24.871
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

4456
01:58:24.871 --> 01:58:25.704
<v Speaker 2>It's a medium.</v>

4457
01:58:26.130 --> 01:58:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Anytime there's anything on the,</v>

4458
01:58:28.081 --> 01:58:29.130
<v Speaker 2>on the underground or time,</v>

4459
01:58:29.131 --> 01:58:30.180
<v Speaker 2>people talk about boxing,</v>

4460
01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:32.220
<v Speaker 2>but you're able to appreciate as a,</v>

4461
01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:33.310
<v Speaker 2>as an officiant auto.</v>

4462
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4463
01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 2>And somebody is really sophisticated and your knowledge of the sport,</v>

4464
01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:39.150
<v Speaker 2>whereas most people are just wanting to see an intense drama.</v>

4465
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:39.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4466
01:58:39.661 --> 01:58:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I watched it with my wife</v>

4467
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.760
<v Speaker 3>has never been in a fight in her life and doesn't know Jack Shit about psychic.</v>

4468
01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of funny,</v>

4469
01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:46.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4470
01:58:46.481 --> 01:58:47.314
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

4471
01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 3>if you look at our Dvr,</v>

4472
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:49.151
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

4473
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:51.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like two competing philosophies,</v>

4474
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 3>reality shows versus she doesn't watch reality shows,</v>

4475
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:54.941
<v Speaker 3>but she's,</v>

4476
01:58:54.941 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4477
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 3>she's very much into different shit that I'm into and I don't,</v>

4478
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind that.</v>

4479
01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:01.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't and she doesn't mind,</v>

4480
01:59:01.571 --> 01:59:01.700
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

4481
01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's like when our path or our interests cross and she watches what I watch,</v>

4482
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:09.610
<v Speaker 3>WWE becomes hilarious cause she doesn't know anything about fighting.</v>

4483
01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4484
01:59:10.150 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 3>She actually said this to me,</v>

4485
01:59:11.231 --> 01:59:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I've said this a bunch of times in the podcast I promised the last time I say it</v>

4486
01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:14.680
<v Speaker 3>to anybody who's listening.</v>

4487
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:17.350
<v Speaker 3>She actually says you should have to get knocked down in order to win.</v>

4488
01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:18.341
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

4489
01:59:18.341 --> 01:59:19.300
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

4490
01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:20.740
<v Speaker 3>She goes with Ellie will make them fight more.</v>

4491
01:59:20.741 --> 01:59:21.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4492
01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:22.160
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting.</v>

4493
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Know God damn woman.</v>

4494
01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't understand what's happening here.</v>

4495
01:59:27.011 --> 01:59:27.844
<v Speaker 3>This guy is,</v>

4496
01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:29.470
<v Speaker 3>he's doing what he wants to do.</v>

4497
01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:33.250
<v Speaker 3>He's if he stood in front of Manny Pacquiao and they just went rock 'em sock 'em</v>

4498
01:59:33.251 --> 01:59:35.020
<v Speaker 3>robots with fucking anything can happen.</v>

4499
01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:37.300
<v Speaker 3>But the way he's doing it,</v>

4500
01:59:37.301 --> 01:59:39.970
<v Speaker 3>he's controlling all the variables.</v>

4501
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:41.020
<v Speaker 3>He's controlling it,</v>

4502
01:59:41.021 --> 01:59:44.050
<v Speaker 3>but he's controlling it with his skill and his dedication and his practice and</v>

4503
01:59:44.051 --> 01:59:45.360
<v Speaker 3>his knowledge and he's,</v>

4504
01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:47.350
<v Speaker 3>he's information chunking.</v>

4505
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:47.980
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

4506
01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:52.450
<v Speaker 3>that's something that I really truly appreciate about high level Jujitsu</v>

4507
01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.021
<v Speaker 3>artists,</v>

4508
01:59:53.021 --> 01:59:55.330
<v Speaker 3>about high level martial artists in any venue.</v>

4509
01:59:55.331 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I love watching people problem solve in real time,</v>

4510
01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:01.120
<v Speaker 3>much better than anybody else is doing.</v>

4511
02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.471
<v Speaker 3>And that's what he does.</v>

4512
02:00:02.471 --> 02:00:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Like he knows like he knows how you're gonna react to it.</v>

4513
02:00:05.241 --> 02:00:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Thanks pop.</v>

4514
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.500
<v Speaker 3>And it'll like poppy with that jab and he knows that you're going to look to</v>

4515
02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:10.520
<v Speaker 3>step to your left and he's already out of there.</v>

4516
02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.650
<v Speaker 3>He's already like when many pack yet would step in and throw that right hook and</v>

4517
02:00:14.651 --> 02:00:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Floyd would dip to his left and duck and slide right off the ropes.</v>

4518
02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:19.480
<v Speaker 3>It was genius,</v>

4519
02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 3>the artistic,</v>

4520
02:00:20.651 --> 02:00:20.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4521
02:00:20.891 --> 02:00:22.540
<v Speaker 3>he planned it perfectly.</v>

4522
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:26.770
<v Speaker 3>He knew the pat cow is a certain type of blitz style and Floyd just wasn't</v>

4523
02:00:26.771 --> 02:00:26.921
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4524
02:00:26.921 --> 02:00:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Still enjoy watching boxing or do you find it,</v>

4525
02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:29.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4526
02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:32.080
<v Speaker 3>kind of boring after watching MMA?</v>

4527
02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4528
02:00:32.770 --> 02:00:33.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not as fun,</v>

4529
02:00:33.941 --> 02:00:35.670
<v Speaker 3>but I still love it like a,</v>

4530
02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 3>I really love watching Canelo Alvarez fight cause it's fights are fucking chaos.</v>

4531
02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Gennady Golovkin who funds this weekend,</v>

4532
02:00:41.770 --> 02:00:42.700
<v Speaker 3>he's the best.</v>

4533
02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Golovkin is the best to watch because you know,</v>

4534
02:00:45.191 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 3>someone's getting knocked the fuck out.</v>

4535
02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy just is a destroyer.</v>

4536
02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:50.560
<v Speaker 3>He just seeks and destroys,</v>

4537
02:00:50.561 --> 02:00:51.700
<v Speaker 3>seeks and destroys.</v>

4538
02:00:51.701 --> 02:00:55.060
<v Speaker 3>And just slowly chips away at the best of them to the point where they just</v>

4539
02:00:55.061 --> 02:00:57.250
<v Speaker 3>can't take it anymore and their body starts giving out.</v>

4540
02:00:57.670 --> 02:00:58.181
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

4541
02:00:58.181 --> 02:00:58.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4542
02:00:58.301 --> 02:01:02.380
<v Speaker 3>he's had 300 and fucking 50 something fights when you count his amateur career.</v>

4543
02:01:02.410 --> 02:01:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4544
02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:03.460
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

4545
02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.000
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

4546
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:04.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4547
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Never been knocked down.</v>

4548
02:01:05.141 --> 02:01:05.801
<v Speaker 3>Never been dropped.</v>

4549
02:01:05.801 --> 02:01:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Never been hurt.</v>

4550
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.840
<v Speaker 3>And he's knocked out every one.</v>

4551
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4552
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:10.623
<v Speaker 3>and you look at him,</v>

4553
02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.160
<v Speaker 3>he looks like he's in a boy band.</v>

4554
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.433
<v Speaker 3>Little Sweetie.</v>

4555
02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:14.381
<v Speaker 3>Look at his face.</v>

4556
02:01:14.381 --> 02:01:16.720
<v Speaker 3>He's got a big smile and the way he talks,</v>

4557
02:01:16.721 --> 02:01:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I bring big drama fight.</v>

4558
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:19.420
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

4559
02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I said always amazing me.</v>

4560
02:01:20.291 --> 02:01:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Drama shows sport where one person is so much better than everyone else.</v>

4561
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:28.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not Roger Federer in tennis or it's not necessarily that he is so much</v>

4562
02:01:28.751 --> 02:01:29.584
<v Speaker 3>better than everyone else.</v>

4563
02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 3>He's so much better than everyone he's fought.</v>

4564
02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:34.930
<v Speaker 3>He has to fight a Mayweather or maybe there's a little smaller than him.</v>

4565
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:35.853
<v Speaker 3>His father,</v>

4566
02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:37.610
<v Speaker 3>the ways Floyd senior said that.</v>

4567
02:01:37.611 --> 02:01:37.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4568
02:01:37.721 --> 02:01:39.190
<v Speaker 3>he ain't find no damn giant.</v>

4569
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 3>A giant.</v>

4570
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:41.850
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking my size.</v>

4571
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

4572
02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:43.371
<v Speaker 2>Eight or something,</v>

4573
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:46.190
<v Speaker 2>or five nine who's not a big guy,</v>

4574
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:46.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4575
02:01:46.821 --> 02:01:48.500
<v Speaker 2>he's just amazing.</v>

4576
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:51.080
<v Speaker 2>But he's won 60 fights at one 60.</v>

4577
02:01:51.081 --> 02:01:51.291
<v Speaker 2>And me,</v>

4578
02:01:51.291 --> 02:01:52.550
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a one 47.</v>

4579
02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4580
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of get it.</v>

4581
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.651
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4582
02:01:54.651 --> 02:01:54.891
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4583
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:55.850
<v Speaker 2>if Canelo Alvarez,</v>

4584
02:01:55.851 --> 02:01:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I think he's big enough to fight them.</v>

4585
02:01:57.230 --> 02:01:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be a fucking fantastic fight.</v>

4586
02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:04.700
<v Speaker 2>God Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin would be fucking amazing because Alvarez,</v>

4587
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4588
02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:06.380
<v Speaker 2>he could knock out anybody.</v>

4589
02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4590
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>

4591
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:08.540
<v Speaker 2>And so can glove gun.</v>

4592
02:02:08.541 --> 02:02:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I think Golovkin is a bit more skilled than him.</v>

4593
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:12.080
<v Speaker 2>A bit more,</v>

4594
02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>more refined and more technical.</v>

4595
02:02:14.211 --> 02:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>But Khan Damn Alvarez is a fucking monster.</v>

4596
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.353
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>

4597
02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.313
<v Speaker 2>That would be exciting.</v>

4598
02:02:18.710 --> 02:02:19.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4599
02:02:19.071 --> 02:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>a survey called Kovalev is another really exciting guy and he's Russian dudes</v>

4600
02:02:23.871 --> 02:02:25.250
<v Speaker 2>are not regular white people.</v>

4601
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.320
<v Speaker 2>They just are not so true.</v>

4602
02:02:27.650 --> 02:02:29.300
<v Speaker 2>We need to get that in our head folks.</v>

4603
02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.790
<v Speaker 2>He let these guys turn Europeans.</v>

4604
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4605
02:02:32.290 --> 02:02:32.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4606
02:02:32.501 --> 02:02:37.370
<v Speaker 2>it was coming from hardscrabble backgrounds and how about fucking thousand years</v>

4607
02:02:37.371 --> 02:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>of hard scrabble genetics.</v>

4608
02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:39.700
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4609
02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:40.040
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4610
02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4611
02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And not these pussy Americans.</v>

4612
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:43.910
<v Speaker 2>We're dealing with Bella tour.</v>

4613
02:02:43.930 --> 02:02:45.470
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of tough Russians.</v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4627
02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:59.120

<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4632
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I watched a video of him wrestling Luke Rockhold and I'm like,</v>

4633
02:03:07.641 --> 02:03:11.810
<v Speaker 2>how come a fucking guy who fights at one 55 is fighting the biggest one?</v>

4634
02:03:11.811 --> 02:03:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Eight F is wrestling the biggest 185 pounds of the world's ever known.</v>

4635
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.843
<v Speaker 2>What is going on in there?</v>

4636
02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Does he wrestle cane too?</v>

4637
02:03:18.410 --> 02:03:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean what,</v>

4638
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.340
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

4639
02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:19.970
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

4640
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know that Rockhold wrestles came.</v>

4641
02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4642
02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Where do you guys end us?</v>

4643
02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:24.580

4647
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:33.560

4652
02:03:38.751 --> 02:03:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean [inaudible] you got the best grappler I think in the division in Habib</v>

4653
02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:47.360
<v Speaker 2>versus one of the very best strikers and all of the UFC.</v>

4654
02:03:47.770 --> 02:03:47.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4655
02:03:47.991 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Donald is such a good morning tie striker.</v>

4656
02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:50.930
<v Speaker 2>He's so good.</v>

4657
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:52.123
<v Speaker 2>He's so good at,</v>

4658
02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

4659
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:56.360
<v Speaker 2>when you see him fight a guy that is not at his level,</v>

4660
02:03:56.361 --> 02:03:59.180
<v Speaker 2>that's when you really understand how good he is and you see him fight like a</v>

4661
02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Jim Miller and see what he could do to those guys.</v>

4662
02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:02.090
<v Speaker 2>That's where you kind of get in your head.</v>

4663
02:04:02.091 --> 02:04:02.301
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4667
02:04:04.851 --> 02:04:05.291
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>

4668
02:04:05.291 --> 02:04:05.540

4670
02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Super prepared.</v>

4671
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:13.490
<v Speaker 2>He's been fighting so often and he's like just in the groove right now.</v>

4672
02:04:13.491 --> 02:04:16.670
<v Speaker 2>This is his time trying to bulletproof.</v>

4673
02:04:16.671 --> 02:04:17.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4681
02:04:25.401 --> 02:04:26.360
<v Speaker 2>He's the real deal.</v>

4682
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4683
02:04:26.691 --> 02:04:27.800

4685
02:04:29.310 --> 02:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>gets on fucking bowls and rides him.</v>

4686
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:31.151
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

4687
02:04:31.151 --> 02:04:31.820
<v Speaker 2>he jumps,</v>

4688
02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:33.740
<v Speaker 2>he keeps the most dangerous sport in the world by the way.</v>

4689
02:04:33.741 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 2>But it's not as bold.</v>

4690
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:35.780
<v Speaker 2>That's just people being assholes.</v>

4691
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>You get call it a support.</v>

4692
02:04:37.981 --> 02:04:38.910
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

4693
02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:42.150
<v Speaker 2>It was a great article in the New Yorker about bull riding and it's amazing.</v>

4694
02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:42.391
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4695
02:04:42.391 --> 02:04:44.220
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a sport of the bull signed up for it.</v>

4696
02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:44.791
<v Speaker 2>If the bowls,</v>

4697
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:45.000
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4698

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

02:04:45.451 --> 02:04:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to see if I can fucking shake a dude.</v>

4701
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.510
<v Speaker 2>They breed these bolts out.</v>

4702
02:04:48.511 --> 02:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>They breed them to shake.</v>

4703
02:04:49.471 --> 02:04:50.640
<v Speaker 2>They breed would be violent.</v>

4704
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:51.890
<v Speaker 2>They breed be dangerous.</v>

4705
02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do.</v>

4706
02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:53.341
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

4707
02:04:53.341 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4708
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:53.990
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

4709
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:55.320
<v Speaker 2>the highest rate of head injuries,</v>

4710
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:56.220
<v Speaker 2>neck injuries.</v>

4711
02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:59.360
<v Speaker 2>We had a guy on fire for injuries that had his,</v>

4712
02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:02.460
<v Speaker 2>his elbow or shoulder rather just destroyed.</v>

4713
02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:05.970
<v Speaker 2>He was a professional bull rider and he showed me a scar is I get took off his</v>

4714
02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:08.520
<v Speaker 2>shirt and his whole like is,</v>

4715
02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 2>is he had like lines everywhere connecting his shoulder to his,</v>

4716
02:05:13.951 --> 02:05:15.140
<v Speaker 2>his jigsaw puzzle.</v>

4717
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:19.290
<v Speaker 2>How many times he had surgery and he had some fucking ungodly number of shoulder</v>

4718
02:05:19.291 --> 02:05:19.651
<v Speaker 2>soldier.</v>

4719
02:05:19.651 --> 02:05:20.221
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember,</v>

4720
02:05:20.221 --> 02:05:22.440
<v Speaker 2>like nine or 10 and he goes,</v>

4721
02:05:22.450 --> 02:05:23.370
<v Speaker 2>anything goes wrong.</v>

4722
02:05:23.370 --> 02:05:24.210
<v Speaker 2>It just pops out.</v>

4723
02:05:24.570 --> 02:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Like if he falls wrong,</v>

4724
02:05:25.751 --> 02:05:28.140
<v Speaker 2>which is pops out and then I need someone to like Yank on it.</v>

4725
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4726
02:05:28.610 --> 02:05:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I guess you got to extend it in a pop back in place</v>

4727
02:05:34.410 --> 02:05:38.730
<v Speaker 2>and all for what to so he can get that eight seconds on a monster and hot.</v>

4728
02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:39.401
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>

4729
02:05:39.401 --> 02:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I tell him,</v>

4730
02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:39.961
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4731
02:05:39.961 --> 02:05:40.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4732
02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:42.000
<v Speaker 2>it seems crazy to people from the outside,</v>

4733
02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:43.650
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain challenge to it.</v>

4734
02:05:43.651 --> 02:05:44.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a quest to it.</v>

4735
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I would hop in array.</v>

4736
02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I would agree to three fights in the night before.</v>

4737
02:05:48.511 --> 02:05:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I would agree to ride a bull.</v>

4738
02:05:50.190 --> 02:05:51.023
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>

4739
02:05:51.090 --> 02:05:52.230
<v Speaker 2>When you're fucking doubt about it,</v>

4740
02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you're not very good at writing good at it.</v>

4741
02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>The best,</v>

4742
02:05:55.150 --> 02:05:57.240
<v Speaker 2>the best guy could do eight seconds.</v>

4743
02:05:57.241 --> 02:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Did you fucking do?</v>

4744
02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody sucks it riding bulls.</v>

4745
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 2>If there was a dude out there that was like the Michael Jordan of bull riding,</v>

4746
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:04.350
<v Speaker 2>they could just ride bulls for like a half an hour.</v>

4747
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>They're just kicking him and shit and he's like,</v>

4748
02:06:05.731 --> 02:06:06.460
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4749
02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:06.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4750
02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:08.760
<v Speaker 2>he's like blowing kisses to his mom in the crowd.</v>

4751
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Then I would say there's a guy that's good at bull riding but everybody sucks.</v>

4752
02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:14.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just some guy saw that less.</v>

4753
02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at regular blue line.</v>

4754
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I was at this fair one time and uh,</v>

4755
02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:22.220
<v Speaker 2>they had one was mechanical bowls and everybody's riding,</v>

4756
02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:22.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4757
02:06:22.650 --> 02:06:23.940
<v Speaker 2>doing it right the one hand away.</v>

4758
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm like fuck it,</v>

4759
02:06:24.571 --> 02:06:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

4760
02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

4761
02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna beat this thing and I just,</v>

4762
02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:27.983
<v Speaker 2>I just clench.</v>

4763
02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I could on two hands,</v>

4764
02:06:30.031 --> 02:06:30.750
<v Speaker 2>hold onto it,</v>

4765
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:32.130
<v Speaker 2>bury my face into it and its,</v>

4766
02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:32.641
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

4767
02:06:32.641 --> 02:06:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4768
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:33.470
<v Speaker 2>how was that?</v>

4769
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

4770
02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I wrote for like two minutes.</v>

4771
02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:37.890
<v Speaker 2>How wild have people booed me,</v>

4772
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4773
02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>for cheating.</v>

4774
02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And the other half were like,</v>

4775
02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I never thought I got that.</v>

4776
02:06:40.911 --> 02:06:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Got the genius.</v>

4777
02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:43.410
<v Speaker 2>So you grab it like a rear naked choke.</v>

4778
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:44.071
<v Speaker 2>You grab it.</v>

4779
02:06:44.071 --> 02:06:44.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4780
02:06:44.221 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you're like you're pulling guard as hard as you possibly can.</v>

4781
02:06:47.010 --> 02:06:47.820
<v Speaker 2>But wait a minute.</v>

4782
02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:48.061
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4783
02:06:48.061 --> 02:06:48.630
<v Speaker 2>let me think.</v>

4784
02:06:48.630 --> 02:06:49.680
<v Speaker 2>You seen him mechanical ball,</v>

4785
02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:50.970
<v Speaker 2>but where are you grabbing it?</v>

4786
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:52.440
<v Speaker 2>You can just kind of grab around.</v>

4787
02:06:52.441 --> 02:06:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like you pull a picture of a mechanical bullet please.</v>

4788
02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.670
<v Speaker 2>A pommel horse in gymnastics.</v>

4789
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:58.380
<v Speaker 2>You're the pommel horse in gymnastics.</v>

4790
02:06:58.540 --> 02:06:59.373
<v Speaker 2>Trying to like that.</v>

4791
02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:02.010
<v Speaker 2>You can just kind of get under it with both of your hands.</v>

4792
02:07:02.011 --> 02:07:03.150
<v Speaker 2>You put your face into it.</v>

4793
02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very curious now because I rode one of those things for some stupid MTV</v>

4794
02:07:07.291 --> 02:07:10.860
<v Speaker 2>thing and I was shocked at how easy it was to them to fly me off.</v>

4795
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:11.461
<v Speaker 2>That fucker.</v>

4796
02:07:11.461 --> 02:07:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't any last five seconds.</v>

4797
02:07:13.051 --> 02:07:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I wrote for like two minutes.</v>

4798
02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:14.963
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

4799
02:07:15.730 --> 02:07:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh there's a bunch of different kinds.</v>

4800
02:07:17.071 --> 02:07:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

4801
02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Some of them actually looked like a real cow.</v>

4802
02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I wrote the cow kind.</v>

4803
02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:21.810
<v Speaker 2>The one that looks like a cow.</v>

4804
02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Did it have horns or no,</v>

4805
02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he had horns.</v>

4806
02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:24.721
<v Speaker 2>We had rubber horns,</v>

4807
02:07:24.721 --> 02:07:25.080
<v Speaker 2>but I could,</v>

4808
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:28.760
<v Speaker 2>I could get right around his head cause a real horns.</v>

4809
02:07:28.810 --> 02:07:29.643
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

4810
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4811
02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:31.171
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4812
02:07:31.171 --> 02:07:32.060
<v Speaker 2>so you can get you out one.</v>

4813
02:07:32.061 --> 02:07:32.591
<v Speaker 2>That one right there.</v>

4814
02:07:32.591 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I see that one with,</v>

4815
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>with the fair where they have the bubble around it.</v>

4816
02:07:35.801 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

4817
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:36.670
<v Speaker 1>that right there.</v>

4818
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:36.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4819
02:07:36.881 --> 02:07:37.211
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

4820
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:37.961
<v Speaker 1>Then I could click on that.</v>

4821
02:07:37.961 --> 02:07:38.794
<v Speaker 1>That's when I wrote,</v>

4822
02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you can just get him around the neck.</v>

4823
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:41.560
<v Speaker 1>You kind of choke them out.</v>

4824
02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4825
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:43.150
<v Speaker 1>You clinch real hard.</v>

4826
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:43.751
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

4827
02:07:43.751 --> 02:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>his head was bigger so you don't know if you could get around his head.</v>

4828
02:07:46.210 --> 02:07:46.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4829
02:07:46.361 --> 02:07:47.680
<v Speaker 1>That guy's riding it like a moron.</v>

4830
02:07:47.730 --> 02:07:47.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4831
02:07:47.881 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why they called the rear naked choke.</v>

4832
02:07:51.011 --> 02:07:51.731
<v Speaker 1>The lion killer.</v>

4833
02:07:51.731 --> 02:07:53.440
<v Speaker 1>They say there's only one way to kill a lion.</v>

4834
02:07:53.441 --> 02:07:53.951
<v Speaker 1>He got a choke.</v>

4835
02:07:53.951 --> 02:07:54.784
<v Speaker 1>It kind of choke it out.</v>

4836
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Get it back to get it back.</v>

4837
02:07:56.771 --> 02:07:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4838
02:07:57.130 --> 02:07:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Good luck getting your fucking arms around the lines neck.</v>

4839
02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:00.341
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get.</v>

4840
02:08:00.341 --> 02:08:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Your alarms are how big guys?</v>

4841
02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:01.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4842
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4843
02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4844
02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:03.221
<v Speaker 1>Get your arms here.</v>

4845
02:08:03.221 --> 02:08:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Those guys that I could,</v>

4846
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't choke.</v>

4847
02:08:05.070 --> 02:08:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4848
02:08:05.301 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could,</v>

4849
02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:08.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's not easy.</v>

4850
02:08:08.590 --> 02:08:10.840
<v Speaker 1>But a lion is strong as fuck.</v>

4851
02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:13.510
<v Speaker 1>They weigh 500 pounds in a bowl,</v>

4852
02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:13.831
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4853
02:08:13.831 --> 02:08:14.081
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4854
02:08:14.081 --> 02:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>so you reach under and what are you grabbing with your arms?</v>

4855
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4856
02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:17.501
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4857
02:08:17.501 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 1>his neck is too big,</v>

4858
02:08:18.431 --> 02:08:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's an action in his neck was a little smaller.</v>

4859
02:08:20.051 --> 02:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>And just get your arms around his neck.</v>

4860
02:08:21.331 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you ask grip it?</v>

4861
02:08:22.450 --> 02:08:23.283
<v Speaker 1>I think I did.</v>

4862
02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I did something like that probably so it was a small mechanical bull.</v>

4863
02:08:26.621 --> 02:08:27.570
<v Speaker 1>He might his bitch ass.</v>

4864
02:08:28.330 --> 02:08:29.180
<v Speaker 1>He was killing her fluff.</v>

4865
02:08:29.181 --> 02:08:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You were riding a mechanical cow.</v>

4866
02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:33.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like a calf maybe they feel this is one of my best moments.</v>

4867
02:08:34.210 --> 02:08:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any moments of Vixxo.</v>

4868
02:08:35.591 --> 02:08:36.670
<v Speaker 1>People booed you.</v>

4869
02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Half of them booed me for cheating,</v>

4870
02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:38.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4871
02:08:38.501 --> 02:08:42.580
<v Speaker 1>because it was obviously like counter to the spirit of it broke the code.</v>

4872
02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:43.414
<v Speaker 1>He figured it out.</v>

4873
02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:44.980
<v Speaker 1>But it was tough though.</v>

4874
02:08:44.981 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean my face was all like a cut out.</v>

4875
02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4876
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:49.810
<v Speaker 1>You get anything out of it or just pride?</v>

4877
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I got probably got a lot of pride out.</v>

4878
02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you about it on the air.</v>

4879
02:08:52.211 --> 02:08:53.044
<v Speaker 1>This was my big moment.</v>

4880
02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:54.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4881
02:08:54.971 --> 02:08:57.220
<v Speaker 1>The idea of riding a giant animal.</v>

4882
02:08:57.221 --> 02:08:58.054
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4883
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the idea of raising those things to do that.</v>

4884
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:03.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

4885
02:09:03.581 --> 02:09:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like zoos,</v>

4886
02:09:04.511 --> 02:09:04.751
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4887
02:09:04.751 --> 02:09:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I go to zoos and it drives me nuts.</v>

4888
02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:07.331
<v Speaker 1>Bull fighting.</v>

4889
02:09:07.331 --> 02:09:07.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>

4890
02:09:07.901 --> 02:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's bad.</v>

4891
02:09:10.090 --> 02:09:10.900
<v Speaker 1>More fucked up.</v>

4892
02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Both hands.</v>

4893
02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Way More fucked up cause I don't think there's anything bad that really happens</v>

4894
02:09:13.661 --> 02:09:14.021
<v Speaker 1>to the boy.</v>

4895
02:09:14.021 --> 02:09:17.680
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like cause people on his back and he bucks him off ferociously and</v>

4896
02:09:17.681 --> 02:09:20.410
<v Speaker 1>they're only on there for eight seconds and some of these bowls are smart and</v>

4897
02:09:20.411 --> 02:09:22.120
<v Speaker 1>they figured out how to hurt people.</v>

4898
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:23.201
<v Speaker 1>Like they know if they,</v>

4899
02:09:23.201 --> 02:09:26.560
<v Speaker 1>if they buck and just a certain way while throwing their head back at the same</v>

4900
02:09:26.561 --> 02:09:27.280
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

4901
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.620
<v Speaker 1>you know they can really do damage to people and get these people off their</v>

4902
02:09:29.621 --> 02:09:30.040
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

4903
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

4904
02:09:31.170 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are basically killers and they have to be retired because they get</v>

4905
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:34.564
<v Speaker 1>too good at it.</v>

4906
02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It's article in the New Yorker,</v>

4907
02:09:36.641 --> 02:09:36.761
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4908
02:09:36.761 --> 02:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you Google New Yorker in both fighting.</v>

4909
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:39.700
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing article.</v>

4910
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Both fighting boom.</v>

4911
02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4912
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4913
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:44.201
<v Speaker 1>both fighting.</v>

4914
02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm hugely opposed to,</v>

4915
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:46.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4916
02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:47.500
<v Speaker 1>that drives me crazy.</v>

4917
02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4918
02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:48.761
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4919
02:09:48.761 --> 02:09:52.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people sticking that thing with poisoned arrows are poison</v>

4920
02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:54.110
<v Speaker 1>darts poisoned,</v>

4921
02:09:55.450 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>poisoned.</v>

4922
02:09:56.140 --> 02:10:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's barbaric but there's one of the great books about combat sport is</v>

4923
02:10:01.061 --> 02:10:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway's death in the afternoon.</v>

4924
02:10:02.801 --> 02:10:03.431
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't read that,</v>

4925
02:10:03.431 --> 02:10:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd really recommend it because almost everything he says about bull fighting,</v>

4926
02:10:07.530 --> 02:10:07.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4927
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.910
<v Speaker 1>is re relevant,</v>

4928
02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:10.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4929
02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>to other forms of combat sport.</v>

4930
02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:13.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4931
02:10:13.091 --> 02:10:13.600
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

4932
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.433
<v Speaker 1>really a great book.</v>

4933
02:10:15.010 --> 02:10:16.420
<v Speaker 1>They had some sort of poison,</v>

4934
02:10:16.421 --> 02:10:18.190
<v Speaker 1>they using those spears and the Jab.</v>

4935
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:19.361
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe so.</v>

4936
02:10:19.361 --> 02:10:19.441
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4937
02:10:19.441 --> 02:10:19.591
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4938
02:10:19.591 --> 02:10:21.040
<v Speaker 1>the spears are basically what they do.</v>

4939
02:10:21.041 --> 02:10:21.241
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4940
02:10:21.241 --> 02:10:23.860
<v Speaker 1>they drain energy from the animal and they also,</v>

4941
02:10:23.970 --> 02:10:25.930
<v Speaker 1>and they also force it to put his head down.</v>

4942
02:10:26.610 --> 02:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4943
02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 1>and that's important because the killing stroke needs to be delivered over the</v>

4944
02:10:30.251 --> 02:10:31.084
<v Speaker 1>horns.</v>

4945
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And so until the,</v>

4946
02:10:34.230 --> 02:10:38.660
<v Speaker 2>what we wanted to have a very clean balletic a type of kill,</v>

4947
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:39.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4948
02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

4949
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:42.590
<v Speaker 2>which means that they have to have to get the animal's head arrange in a</v>

4950
02:10:42.591 --> 02:10:45.200
<v Speaker 2>downward position so they can get the sword to go home.</v>

4951
02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:46.820
<v Speaker 2>So where are they trying to drive it into?</v>

4952
02:10:46.821 --> 02:10:48.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like a spinal call.</v>

4953
02:10:48.321 --> 02:10:48.951
<v Speaker 2>Like I've seen him do it,</v>

4954
02:10:48.951 --> 02:10:49.311
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

4955
02:10:49.311 --> 02:10:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I think to go for the heart.</v>

4956
02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>But they go in and we'll then go back.</v>

4957
02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:53.870
<v Speaker 2>They go in with a,</v>

4958
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:54.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4959
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:54.471
<v Speaker 2>a two foot,</v>

4960
02:10:54.471 --> 02:10:56.150
<v Speaker 2>three foot sore all the way to the hill.</v>

4961
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

4962
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:58.340
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go and right to the hill.</v>

4963
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It goes in like butter.</v>

4964
02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

4965
02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Did they eat the bull after they do that?</v>

4966
02:11:04.161 --> 02:11:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Cause bowls are not that delicious.</v>

4967
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4968
02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4969
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:08.301
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4970
02:11:08.301 --> 02:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I imagine they do it and these are peasants societies that you know,</v>

4971
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:11.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4972
02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:13.010
<v Speaker 2>develop this custom and I'm sure they,</v>

4973
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 2>they ate the ball.</v>

4974
02:11:14.150 --> 02:11:14.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4975
02:11:14.301 --> 02:11:17.810
<v Speaker 2>most people aren't aware that if you buy steak in a market,</v>

4976
02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 2>you're getting an animal that's been neutered.</v>

4977
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4978
02:11:20.421 --> 02:11:24.260
<v Speaker 2>You get what's called a steer and they take a bowl and they cut his balls off</v>

4979
02:11:24.261 --> 02:11:27.470
<v Speaker 2>and he's young and they let them grow to size and then they kill him.</v>

4980
02:11:27.650 --> 02:11:29.120
<v Speaker 2>So he has a more tender meat.</v>

4981
02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:30.110
<v Speaker 2>If you eat,</v>

4982
02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:31.910
<v Speaker 2>like I shot a moose in,</v>

4983
02:11:31.911 --> 02:11:32.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>that's a moose cause it doesn't look like a Mousse.</v>

5010
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:02.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a small moves.</v>

5011
02:12:02.601 --> 02:12:05.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why he was only a couple of years old.</v>

5012
02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:06.920
<v Speaker 2>So he was only 900 pounds.</v>

5013
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5014
02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:09.620
<v Speaker 2>But I'm a big moose.</v>

02:12:11.721 --> 02:12:16.460
<v Speaker 2>But not for a moose to get my friend shot one that was 1400 pounds.</v>

5018
02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5019
02:12:17.090 --> 02:12:19.190

5020
02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:22.340
<v Speaker 2>like the tissue is really dense.</v>

5021
02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some areas like the back,</v>

5022
02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 2>like the tenderloins and the backstraps that are more,</v>

5023
02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:29.720
<v Speaker 2>more of a tender meat.</v>

5024
02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5025
02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5026
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:31.131
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

5027
02:12:31.131 --> 02:12:31.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5028
02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:34.390
<v Speaker 2>the tissue of a Moose is so right.</v>

5029
02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking unbelievably powerful animal that,</v>

5030
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:40.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

5031
02:12:40.431 --> 02:12:41.120
<v Speaker 2>when that his,</v>

5032
02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 2>if he got older he would have these huge fucking saloon doors grown out of his</v>

5033
02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:49.640
<v Speaker 2>head and then he would use those to slamming the other dudes who also have those</v>

5034
02:12:49.641 --> 02:12:52.580
<v Speaker 2>things and they're just so strong.</v>

5035
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:54.950
<v Speaker 2>So the meat is like really tough.</v>

5036
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5037
02:12:55.161 --> 02:12:58.210
<v Speaker 2>They haven't been bred for eons to be a hamburger.</v>

5038
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:59.143
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

5039
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:04.150
<v Speaker 2>And my friend shot a water buffalo in Australia and he said they cooked the back</v>

5040
02:13:04.621 --> 02:13:05.061
<v Speaker 2>strap,</v>

5041
02:13:05.061 --> 02:13:06.800
<v Speaker 2>which is like the most tender part.</v>

5042
02:13:06.801 --> 02:13:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And he said he had a piece of meat in his mouth that he chewed for half an hour.</v>

5043
02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:11.310
<v Speaker 2>He's not joking,</v>

5044
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:15.320
<v Speaker 2>said he's practicing his bone out and he was practicing for a half an hour with</v>

5045
02:13:15.321 --> 02:13:18.320
<v Speaker 2>one piece of meat in his mouth and he was trying to break down.</v>

5046
02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5047

5056
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>about how scared I was when I would think about like how much harder,</v>

02:13:44.101 --> 02:13:45.600
<v Speaker 1>about the Afghanistan war.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What kind of fucking Ptsd does that guy have?</v>

5084
02:14:25.770 --> 02:14:26.190
<v Speaker 1>His friend,</v>

5085
02:14:26.190 --> 02:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>his friend died,</v>

5086
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5087
02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:29.080
<v Speaker 1>like a week after,</v>

5088
02:14:29.081 --> 02:14:29.690
<v Speaker 1>or not recapture,</v>

5089
02:14:29.690 --> 02:14:30.870
<v Speaker 1>but as soon afterwards,</v>

5090
02:14:30.871 --> 02:14:31.141
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

5091
02:14:31.141 --> 02:14:34.620
<v Speaker 1>his friend and the other camera man got on Tim Hetherington was killed,</v>

5092
02:14:34.621 --> 02:14:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe in Libya.</v>

5093
02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:36.491
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5094
02:14:36.491 --> 02:14:37.171
<v Speaker 1>and so yeah,</v>

5095
02:14:37.171 --> 02:14:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got some pretty severe emotional insight,</v>

5096
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:42.510
<v Speaker 1>psychological damage from it.</v>

5097
02:14:42.511 --> 02:14:42.870
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5098
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:44.010
<v Speaker 1>he said he was not going back.</v>

5099
02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.780
<v Speaker 1>He said he's not going back to war zones anymore.</v>

5100
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5101
02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's a good decision.</v>

5102
02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5103

02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5106
02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:52.590

02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.720
<v Speaker 1>still I believe so.</v>

5128
02:15:12.721 --> 02:15:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5129
02:15:13.330 --> 02:15:13.541

5130
02:15:13.541 --> 02:15:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So he's a tough guy.</v>

5131
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.980
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I really wanted to talk to you about.</v>

5132
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5133
02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:18.180
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

5134
02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:18.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5135
02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I had heard this concept of professor in the cage,</v>

5136
02:15:20.610 --> 02:15:24.000
<v Speaker 1>the protecting of essential cognitive function,</v>

5137
02:15:24.001 --> 02:15:26.790
<v Speaker 1>which is necessary to pursue your career.</v>

5138
02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5139
02:15:27.210 --> 02:15:28.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5140
02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:32.820
<v Speaker 1>did you find there was any negative repercussions physically?</v>

5141
02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel anything time?</v>

5142
02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5143
02:15:34.770 --> 02:15:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the first time I got punched really hard in the face,</v>

5144
02:15:37.570 --> 02:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5145
02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:39.030
<v Speaker 1>was really educate.</v>

5146
02:15:39.031 --> 02:15:39.930
<v Speaker 1>It's really educational,</v>

5147
02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5148
02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:41.970
<v Speaker 1>because watching from outside the cage,</v>

5149
02:15:42.150 --> 02:15:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you kinda know like,</v>

5150
02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:43.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5151
02:15:43.321 --> 02:15:44.700
<v Speaker 1>this isn't good for these people.</v>

5152
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:47.100
<v Speaker 1>You kind of know what to brain damage contest,</v>

5153
02:15:47.490 --> 02:15:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's different actually feel it.</v>

5154
02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:50.191
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

5155
02:15:50.191 --> 02:15:50.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5156
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.050
<v Speaker 1>the first time I got knocked around pretty good,</v>

5157
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5158
02:15:52.730 --> 02:15:53.091
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5159
02:15:53.091 --> 02:15:53.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5160
02:15:53.490 --> 02:15:56.130
<v Speaker 1>and afterwards kind of felt concussed even during the,</v>

5161
02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:57.020
<v Speaker 1>the attack,</v>

5162
02:15:57.020 --> 02:15:58.140
<v Speaker 1>even when I was getting,</v>

5163
02:15:58.141 --> 02:15:59.160
<v Speaker 1>taking these shots,</v>

5164
02:15:59.730 --> 02:16:00.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5165
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I was able to think to myself,</v>

5166
02:16:01.411 --> 02:16:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5167
02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:02.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5168
02:16:02.281 --> 02:16:02.701
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>

5169
02:16:02.701 --> 02:16:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I make my living trying to think smart thoughts and I better quit while I still</v>

5170
02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:08.040
<v Speaker 1>know my alphabet.</v>

5171
02:16:08.610 --> 02:16:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5172
02:16:09.150 --> 02:16:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't.</v>

5173
02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5174
02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:11.040
<v Speaker 1>but what was the,</v>

5175
02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.780
<v Speaker 1>was the negative aspects of it?</v>

5176
02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:13.681
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5177
02:16:13.681 --> 02:16:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5178
02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I had a lot of headaches and,</v>

5179
02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:16.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5180
02:16:16.831 --> 02:16:17.581
<v Speaker 1>occasionally I would,</v>

5181
02:16:17.581 --> 02:16:18.091
<v Speaker 1>I would be,</v>

5182
02:16:18.091 --> 02:16:18.924
<v Speaker 1>I'd be cloudy,</v>

5183
02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:19.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5184
02:16:19.381 --> 02:16:21.060
<v Speaker 1>for a day or two afterwards,</v>

5185
02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:21.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5186
02:16:21.331 --> 02:16:22.380
<v Speaker 1>there's this sort of just barn.</v>

5187
02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5188
02:16:22.651 --> 02:16:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like a little,</v>

5189
02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was like,</v>

5190
02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5191
02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:24.700
<v Speaker 1>describe it.</v>

5192
02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:28.500
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a translucent blanket thrown over my head and slowed my</v>

5193
02:16:28.501 --> 02:16:30.730
<v Speaker 1>thinking and clouded my perception.</v>

5194
02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever get that same sort of feeling just from hard training where you're</v>

5195
02:16:34.510 --> 02:16:36.670
<v Speaker 1>exhausted and all this is definitely a time where,</v>

5196
02:16:36.690 --> 02:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5197
02:16:36.970 --> 02:16:37.803
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times I got,</v>

5198
02:16:37.810 --> 02:16:38.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5199
02:16:38.021 --> 02:16:38.400
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

5200
02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:41.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the situations you're inspiring and guys hit you too hard.</v>

5201
02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And there was a couple of guys who are notorious for it and I got really jacked</v>

5202
02:16:45.191 --> 02:16:45.360
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

5203
02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I buy it by a few guys,</v>

5204
02:16:47.530 --> 02:16:47.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5205
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:48.701
<v Speaker 1>one time where,</v>

5206
02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:48.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5207
02:16:48.851 --> 02:16:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of just landed this brutal left hook against me.</v>

5208
02:16:51.510 --> 02:16:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5209
02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't really mean to like,</v>

5210
02:16:52.931 --> 02:16:53.980
<v Speaker 1>he apologized afterwards.</v>

5211
02:16:53.981 --> 02:16:54.701
<v Speaker 1>I was moving in,</v>

5212
02:16:54.701 --> 02:16:54.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5213
02:16:54.881 --> 02:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>he tagged me hard.</v>

5214
02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5215
02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5216
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5217
02:16:57.641 --> 02:16:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I was almost knocked out,</v>

5218
02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5219
02:17:00.390 --> 02:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5220
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 1>saw stars,</v>

5221
02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:02.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5222
02:17:02.611 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 1>the whole world,</v>

5223
02:17:03.581 --> 02:17:05.950
<v Speaker 1>my perception of the world for artist torques flipping,</v>

5224
02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:06.813
<v Speaker 1>flipping over,</v>

5225
02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>the lights are kind of going on and off and,</v>

5226
02:17:09.490 --> 02:17:09.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5227
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:10.360
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't,</v>

5228
02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5229
02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:11.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5230
02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:11.771
<v Speaker 1>with brain damage,</v>

5231
02:17:11.771 --> 02:17:15.010
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a time bomb that goes off sometime in the future.</v>

5232
02:17:15.010 --> 02:17:15.470
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>

5233
02:17:15.470 --> 02:17:15.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5234
02:17:15.890 --> 02:17:16.960
<v Speaker 1>is there isn't,</v>

5235
02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:17.510
<v Speaker 1>there isn't.</v>

5236
02:17:17.510 --> 02:17:18.400
<v Speaker 1>There's also,</v>

5237
02:17:18.401 --> 02:17:18.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5238
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:21.250
<v Speaker 1>there's an accumulative damage issue,</v>

5239
02:17:21.251 --> 02:17:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a,</v>

5240
02:17:22.541 --> 02:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys where I knew them and then they had one really hard fight and then</v>

5241
02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:27.533
<v Speaker 1>they were different.</v>

5242
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:27.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5243
02:17:27.911 --> 02:17:28.271
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't,</v>

5244
02:17:28.271 --> 02:17:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have anything like that,</v>

5245
02:17:29.111 --> 02:17:30.190
<v Speaker 1>at least not to my knowledge.</v>

5246
02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:30.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5247
02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I'd have,</v>

5248
02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I'd have short term repercussions of it,</v>

5249
02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.360
<v Speaker 1>but how often will you sparring are,</v>

5250
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Kim was not all that enlightened of a place,</v>

5251
02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:40.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5252
02:17:40.271 --> 02:17:42.760
<v Speaker 1>and the culture of it was pretty intense.</v>

5253
02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So I dunno,</v>

5254
02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.450
<v Speaker 1>probably probably twice a week.</v>

5255
02:17:46.451 --> 02:17:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Pretty hard sparring,</v>

5256
02:17:47.710 --> 02:17:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

5257
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:49.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5258
02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm always fascinated by people who know the repercussions and still dive into</v>

5259
02:17:54.281 --> 02:17:55.810
<v Speaker 1>it and still just say,</v>

5260
02:17:55.811 --> 02:17:56.291
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

5261
02:17:56.291 --> 02:17:56.891
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

5262
02:17:56.891 --> 02:17:59.350
<v Speaker 1>it's worth the risk to what everybody is doing nowadays.</v>

5263
02:17:59.351 --> 02:18:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows the risks.</v>

5264
02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5265
02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:01.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5266
02:18:01.081 --> 02:18:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5267
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 1>and then may fighters,</v>

5268
02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:03.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5269
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:04.630
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of either smart guys,</v>

5270
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.710
<v Speaker 1>these are middleclass guys,</v>

5271
02:18:05.711 --> 02:18:07.150
<v Speaker 1>most of them college educated,</v>

5272
02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:10.030
<v Speaker 1>but a guy like you is different because you're not really,</v>

5273
02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean you are an MMA fighter and that you did fight,</v>

5274
02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:15.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's not like what you're pursuing.</v>

5275
02:18:15.710 --> 02:18:16.780
<v Speaker 1>It is my pursuit though.</v>

5276
02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:17.320
<v Speaker 1>My procedures,</v>

5277
02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.610
<v Speaker 1>writing books and I saw a good book in it,</v>

5278
02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:21.460
<v Speaker 1>so I did it for professional reasons too.</v>

5279
02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was,</v>

5280
02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:24.460
<v Speaker 1>there was a personal reason I'd never been in a fight before.</v>

5281
02:18:24.461 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of curious about whether I was a coward or not.</v>

5282
02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:27.191
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5283
02:18:27.191 --> 02:18:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to do this brave thing for me was a very,</v>

5284
02:18:30.130 --> 02:18:30.970
<v Speaker 1>it was a brave thing.</v>

5285
02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5286
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:34.720
<v Speaker 1>but there was also a professional thing just like the fighters have and the</v>

5287
02:18:34.721 --> 02:18:36.310
<v Speaker 1>fighters are doing it because they need to make a living.</v>

5288
02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5289
02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it because I wasn't making much of a living.</v>

5290
02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5291
02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>and I needed to try to do something something up that would,</v>

5292
02:18:43.901 --> 02:18:44.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5293
02:18:44.111 --> 02:18:46.480
<v Speaker 1>that would shock shock a little bit,</v>

5294
02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.670
<v Speaker 1>shocked me out of my old ruts.</v>

5295
02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5296
02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and write a book that had larger audience than the books I'd written before,</v>

5297
02:18:53.201 --> 02:18:55.660
<v Speaker 1>which was sort of books for English lit nerds.</v>

5298
02:18:55.930 --> 02:18:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Now what was the actual experience of the fight?</v>

5299
02:18:59.471 --> 02:19:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Like talk us through the day of it.</v>

5300
02:19:01.901 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 1>What did you feel like when you woke up in the morning?</v>

5301
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:04.121
<v Speaker 1>You knew,</v>

5302
02:19:04.121 --> 02:19:04.871
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

5303
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:05.704
<v Speaker 1>today's the day.</v>

5304
02:19:07.170 --> 02:19:08.003
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5305
02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:08.891
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

5306
02:19:08.891 --> 02:19:09.724
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5307
02:19:10.330 --> 02:19:11.710
<v Speaker 1>there was a level of anxiety,</v>

5308
02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:12.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5309
02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:13.660
<v Speaker 1>that was always there.</v>

5310
02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:14.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5311
02:19:14.710 --> 02:19:15.491
<v Speaker 1>I was glad,</v>

5312
02:19:15.491 --> 02:19:16.001
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

5313
02:19:16.001 --> 02:19:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't feel the terror that I felt that I might fear.</v>

5314
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid that I'd be so scared that I'd like kicking out or just or just</v>

5315
02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:23.853
<v Speaker 1>behave in a,</v>

5316
02:19:24.170 --> 02:19:24.880
<v Speaker 1>in a coward,</v>

5317
02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:25.713
<v Speaker 1>the fashion.</v>

5318
02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:26.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5319
02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and there was a lot of anxiety but it wasn't as bad as I expected.</v>

5320
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And when I got in the cage,</v>

5321
02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:33.290
<v Speaker 1>one thing that was really interesting to me,</v>

5322
02:19:33.291 --> 02:19:34.400
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't know this would happen,</v>

5323
02:19:34.401 --> 02:19:36.890
<v Speaker 1>is all of the feared pretty much evaporated.</v>

5324
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:38.240
<v Speaker 1>A fear is really,</v>

5325
02:19:38.241 --> 02:19:39.074
<v Speaker 1>really useful.</v>

5326
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5327
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:40.910
<v Speaker 1>it's your body's way of saying to you,</v>

5328
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:41.331
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5329
02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:42.530
<v Speaker 1>this is really dumb,</v>

5330
02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:44.173
<v Speaker 1>really dumb.</v>

5331
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's reconsider,</v>

5332
02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:45.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5333
02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:47.750
<v Speaker 1>See if there's a different way to do this thing.</v>

5334
02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's useful going in.</v>

5335
02:19:49.161 --> 02:19:51.410
<v Speaker 1>But once you're in the cage and you've been locked inside,</v>

5336
02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 1>fear is no longer very useful.</v>

5337
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5338
02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>cowering is not going to save you.</v>

5339
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5340
02:19:56.331 --> 02:19:56.931
<v Speaker 1>you're locked in.</v>

5341
02:19:56.931 --> 02:19:58.160
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting out of this thing.</v>

5342
02:19:58.490 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 1>And my fear just kind of went away and it was replaced by something that was</v>

5343
02:20:01.371 --> 02:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>really cool.</v>

5344
02:20:02.631 --> 02:20:03.470
<v Speaker 1>In retrospect,</v>

5345
02:20:03.471 --> 02:20:06.530
<v Speaker 1>it was this a sense of focus that I'd never felt before.</v>

5346
02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:07.611
<v Speaker 1>Never felt before,</v>

5347
02:20:07.611 --> 02:20:08.510
<v Speaker 1>nothing close to it.</v>

5348
02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in this arena and minor league hockey and Rena,</v>

5349
02:20:10.731 --> 02:20:12.590
<v Speaker 1>there's people there hooting and howling.</v>

5350
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5351
02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I saw nothing.</v>

5352
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I heard nothing.</v>

5353
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:19.250
<v Speaker 1>All I could see was the guy in front of me.</v>

5354
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:21.170
<v Speaker 1>All I could hear was him.</v>

5355
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:21.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5356
02:20:21.441 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I've had this incredible tunnel vision.</v>

5357
02:20:22.851 --> 02:20:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So at some point my coach was screaming at me,</v>

5358
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5359
02:20:26.430 --> 02:20:26.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5360
02:20:26.571 --> 02:20:27.560
<v Speaker 1>screaming out instructions,</v>

5361
02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:28.730
<v Speaker 1>screaming out warnings,</v>

5362
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:33.050
<v Speaker 1>and he's a loud guy and he's one of these classic corner men whose voice just</v>

5363
02:20:33.051 --> 02:20:34.030
<v Speaker 1>fills the whole,</v>

5364
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5365
02:20:34.390 --> 02:20:35.070
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>

5366
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.903
<v Speaker 1>I had never heard it.</v>

5367
02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I never heard as there was nothing in the world except for,</v>

5368
02:20:39.801 --> 02:20:40.670
<v Speaker 1>except for that guy.</v>

5369
02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:42.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5370
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.711
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

5371
02:20:42.711 --> 02:20:43.070
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

5372
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.940
<v Speaker 1>how did the fight go?</v>

5373
02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:45.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5374
02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5375
02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get too much away about it,</v>

5376
02:20:47.811 --> 02:20:49.400
<v Speaker 1>but why is it in the book?</v>

5377
02:20:49.430 --> 02:20:51.320
<v Speaker 1>It's in the book and I sort of build some suspense to it,</v>

5378
02:20:51.350 --> 02:20:51.801
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

5379
02:20:51.801 --> 02:20:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to tell us what happened.</v>

5380
02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little bit about what happened.</v>

5381
02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:55.253
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5382
02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the fight was 47 seconds long.</v>

5383
02:20:57.650 --> 02:20:58.483
<v Speaker 1>Did you win?</v>

5384
02:20:58.490 --> 02:21:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I won the first 46 seconds and in the fight took a nasty turn,</v>

5385
02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:04.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5386
02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:06.320
<v Speaker 1>in the last second one second.</v>

5387
02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:07.641
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

5388
02:21:07.641 --> 02:21:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5389
02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:09.020
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty abrupt.</v>

5390
02:21:09.021 --> 02:21:09.854
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5391
02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:10.251
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5392
02:21:10.251 --> 02:21:10.461
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5393
02:21:10.461 --> 02:21:11.660
<v Speaker 1>for 46 seconds I was,</v>

5394
02:21:11.661 --> 02:21:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of imposing my will and things were going my way and I was starting</v>

5395
02:21:14.451 --> 02:21:15.284
<v Speaker 1>to feel good.</v>

5396
02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:15.861
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5397
02:21:15.861 --> 02:21:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

5398
02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:17.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5399
02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5400
02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:18.763
<v Speaker 1>things went bad.</v>

5401
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5402
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:21.620
<v Speaker 1>things went really bad and it was over.</v>

5403
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.371
<v Speaker 1>It was that fast.</v>

5404
02:21:22.371 --> 02:21:22.940
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

5405
02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to do it again after it was over?</v>

5406
02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Desperately.</v>

5407
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Really desperately and it will seem to sweaty yet.</v>

5408
02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even sweaty yet.</v>

5409
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.491
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

5410
02:21:31.491 --> 02:21:31.851
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5411
02:21:31.851 --> 02:21:33.020
<v Speaker 1>now I know how to do this.</v>

5412
02:21:33.050 --> 02:21:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Did you get hit or did you get choked?</v>

5413
02:21:34.970 --> 02:21:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I got her on bird.</v>

5414
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad way to lose.</v>

5415
02:21:37.821 --> 02:21:38.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5416
02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:38.841
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

5417
02:21:38.841 --> 02:21:40.970
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't part of it.</v>

5418
02:21:40.971 --> 02:21:41.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5419
02:21:41.121 --> 02:21:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm approaching it as a writer and I wanted to like a story that was more epic,</v>

5420
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:46.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5421
02:21:46.031 --> 02:21:46.864
<v Speaker 1>a more of a,</v>

5422
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

5423
02:21:47.631 --> 02:21:49.160
<v Speaker 1>it's more of a heroic struggle.</v>

5424
02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Something make a better story.</v>

5425
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5426
02:21:52.130 --> 02:21:52.911
<v Speaker 1>and part of it was,</v>

5427
02:21:52.911 --> 02:21:53.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5428
02:21:53.091 --> 02:21:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I really screwed up.</v>

5429
02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I really screwed up in the fight and afterwards I was like,</v>

5430
02:21:57.831 --> 02:21:58.431
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5431
02:21:58.431 --> 02:22:00.410
<v Speaker 1>now I have this under my belt.</v>

5432
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:03.560
<v Speaker 1>And I was almost positive that I wouldn't have made that mistake again.</v>

5433
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I would know how to do it.</v>

5434
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

5435
02:22:05.690 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I kinda need it really bad rookie mistake.</v>

5436
02:22:07.610 --> 02:22:08.271
<v Speaker 1>What was the mistake?</v>

5437
02:22:08.271 --> 02:22:09.104
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5438
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:13.030
<v Speaker 1>basically my strategy going in was I,</v>

5439
02:22:13.031 --> 02:22:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I was not,</v>

5440
02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I was always a better grappler than I was to striker.</v>

5441
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.350
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that I was a great grappler,</v>

5442
02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but I was better at it than striking.</v>

5443
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:22.790
<v Speaker 1>And so we didn't know anything about the guy.</v>

5444
02:22:22.791 --> 02:22:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Other guy.</v>

5445
02:22:23.390 --> 02:22:24.223
<v Speaker 1>We knew nothing.</v>

5446
02:22:24.350 --> 02:22:25.183
<v Speaker 1>He had no Google.</v>

5447
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:26.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5448
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know if he was a striker,</v>

5449
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:29.071
<v Speaker 1>a grappler.</v>

5450
02:22:29.071 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know if he's left handed or right handed.</v>

5451
02:22:30.571 --> 02:22:32.220
<v Speaker 1>These are all really bad things not to know.</v>

5452
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And so the game plan was us,</v>

5453
02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:36.540
<v Speaker 1>we take them down and try to make them fight me off his back.</v>

5454
02:22:36.541 --> 02:22:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what I did best.</v>

5455
02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:39.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5456
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.901
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

5457
02:22:39.901 --> 02:22:40.260
<v Speaker 1>right off,</v>

5458
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:40.891
<v Speaker 1>right off the bat,</v>

5459
02:22:40.891 --> 02:22:41.724
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5460
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:42.631
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

5461
02:22:42.631 --> 02:22:42.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5462
02:22:42.781 --> 02:22:43.830
<v Speaker 1>a few seconds I shot,</v>

5463
02:22:43.831 --> 02:22:44.664
<v Speaker 1>got a takedown.</v>

5464
02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5465
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.781
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5466
02:22:45.781 --> 02:22:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm down against the fence was about this close to securing the mount.</v>

5467
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:50.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5468
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5469
02:22:50.810 --> 02:22:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5470
02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:52.290
<v Speaker 1>he kind of had me in a headlock.</v>

5471
02:22:52.291 --> 02:22:52.891
<v Speaker 1>I got out of it,</v>

5472
02:22:52.891 --> 02:22:55.620
<v Speaker 1>so my foot up and it was almost in the mountain then,</v>

5473
02:22:55.621 --> 02:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5474
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:58.260
<v Speaker 1>that then was the first clue that I was out of my league.</v>

5475
02:22:58.261 --> 02:22:58.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5476
02:22:58.411 --> 02:23:00.570
<v Speaker 1>right away he just did this really kind of fancy,</v>

5477
02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:02.130
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated thing,</v>

5478
02:23:02.131 --> 02:23:05.070
<v Speaker 1>redrew me effortlessly into the garden and started working on that arm bar.</v>

5479
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5480
02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

5481
02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:09.450
<v Speaker 1>and I knew something was bad,</v>

5482
02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:10.620
<v Speaker 1>something bad was happening.</v>

5483
02:23:10.770 --> 02:23:11.603
<v Speaker 1>And so I guess,</v>

5484
02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:13.470
<v Speaker 1>so I got up and I can't,</v>

5485
02:23:13.471 --> 02:23:13.981
<v Speaker 1>in Yankton,</v>

5486
02:23:13.981 --> 02:23:14.371
<v Speaker 1>Yankton,</v>

5487
02:23:14.371 --> 02:23:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Yankton got out and ran for it.</v>

5488
02:23:16.290 --> 02:23:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5489
02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:18.510
<v Speaker 1>He rose to his feet and chases me.</v>

5490
02:23:19.050 --> 02:23:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>

5491
02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:21.481
<v Speaker 1>that was when,</v>

5492
02:23:21.481 --> 02:23:22.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5493
02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:23.550
<v Speaker 1>unexperienced fighter would have said,</v>

5494
02:23:23.551 --> 02:23:24.384
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5495
02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:27.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good idea to roll around on it with this guy on the ground.</v>

5496
02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.890
<v Speaker 1>We need to change the plan.</v>

5497
02:23:29.130 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's what my coach is screaming at me.</v>

5498
02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:31.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5499
02:23:31.561 --> 02:23:31.711
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5500
02:23:31.711 --> 02:23:32.521
<v Speaker 1>he was screaming at me,</v>

5501
02:23:32.521 --> 02:23:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5502
02:23:33.250 --> 02:23:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go to the ground with this guy.</v>

5503
02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:36.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5504
02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 1>and immediately,</v>

5505
02:23:37.470 --> 02:23:37.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5506
02:23:37.861 --> 02:23:38.190
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

5507
02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:38.461
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

5508
02:23:38.461 --> 02:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't break out of the game plan.</v>

5509
02:23:39.461 --> 02:23:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It never even occurred to me.</v>

5510
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So I waited.</v>

5511
02:23:41.971 --> 02:23:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I sorta set that ambush.</v>

5512
02:23:42.991 --> 02:23:44.180
<v Speaker 1>We were waiting for the guy to throw a punch,</v>

5513
02:23:44.181 --> 02:23:45.150
<v Speaker 1>throw kick and you shoe.</v>

5514
02:23:45.690 --> 02:23:46.171
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

5515
02:23:46.171 --> 02:23:46.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5516
02:23:46.470 --> 02:23:47.071
<v Speaker 1>that happened,</v>

5517
02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:47.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5518
02:23:47.191 --> 02:23:47.830
<v Speaker 1>he kicked me in the,</v>

5519
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:50.610
<v Speaker 1>in the ribs and a at the same,</v>

5520
02:23:50.611 --> 02:23:51.870
<v Speaker 1>same second I shot.</v>

5521
02:23:51.871 --> 02:23:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And it was this great moment in my life.</v>

5522
02:23:53.490 --> 02:23:54.990
<v Speaker 1>It was almost better than the bull riding moment.</v>

5523
02:23:55.450 --> 02:23:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5524
02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:56.700
<v Speaker 1>there's this great picture.</v>

5525
02:23:56.701 --> 02:23:56.971
<v Speaker 1>I got 'em,</v>

5526
02:23:56.971 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5527
02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:58.530
<v Speaker 1>perfect double leg,</v>

5528
02:23:58.531 --> 02:23:59.280
<v Speaker 1>take down,</v>

5529
02:23:59.280 --> 02:23:59.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5530
02:23:59.491 --> 02:24:01.900
<v Speaker 1>he's airborne and we come down hard smack.</v>

5531
02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5532
02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5533
02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:05.370
<v Speaker 1>and at this point I feel like I'm in control.</v>

5534
02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:05.821
<v Speaker 1>This fight,</v>

5535
02:24:05.821 --> 02:24:06.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm winning,</v>

5536
02:24:06.211 --> 02:24:07.170
<v Speaker 1>everything is going great.</v>

5537
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5538
02:24:08.130 --> 02:24:09.990
<v Speaker 1>and the next thing I know,</v>

5539
02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:10.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5540
02:24:10.381 --> 02:24:10.921
<v Speaker 1>one second,</v>

5541
02:24:10.921 --> 02:24:11.910
<v Speaker 1>two seconds later,</v>

5542
02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:12.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5543
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:14.700
<v Speaker 1>he'd somehow swept me.</v>

5544
02:24:14.701 --> 02:24:15.001
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

5545
02:24:15.001 --> 02:24:15.630
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

5546
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:16.830
<v Speaker 1>it was a fancy arm bar.</v>

5547
02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:17.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5548
02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:17.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

5549
02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

5550
02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

5551
02:24:17.850 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I was a white belt at best,</v>

5552
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5553
02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:23.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's a fancy arm bar where he managed to sort of flipped me over like a</v>

5554
02:24:23.401 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 1>pancake and,</v>

5555
02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5556
02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 1>next thing I know I'm looking up at the ceiling instead of looking down and it</v>

5557
02:24:28.381 --> 02:24:29.850
<v Speaker 1>was tight and it was just watch it.</v>

5558
02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:30.781
<v Speaker 1>I watched it.</v>

5559
02:24:30.781 --> 02:24:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5560
02:24:31.170 --> 02:24:33.060
<v Speaker 1>But it took me a while to even figure out what he had done.</v>

5561
02:24:33.090 --> 02:24:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Is it available online?</v>

5562
02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5563
02:24:35.130 --> 02:24:35.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5564
02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

5565
02:24:36.310 --> 02:24:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I have the video.</v>

5566
02:24:37.290 --> 02:24:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I could show you what I'd like to see a transition.</v>

5567
02:24:39.331 --> 02:24:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5568
02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>What he did.</v>

5569
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5570
02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

5571
02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I could show you like we could get on the ground here and I can show you.</v>

5572
02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:45.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5573
02:24:45.051 --> 02:24:45.190
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5574
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.651
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

5575
02:24:45.651 --> 02:24:45.901
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5576
02:24:45.901 --> 02:24:46.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we really,</v>

5577
02:24:46.651 --> 02:24:47.484
<v Speaker 1>really basic,</v>

5578
02:24:47.490 --> 02:24:48.360
<v Speaker 1>super basic.</v>

5579
02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:49.470
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

5580
02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:50.131
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

5581
02:24:50.131 --> 02:24:50.640
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

5582
02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:50.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5583
02:24:50.851 --> 02:24:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm only a year into this at this point in my Jujitsu was pretty,</v>

5584
02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:53.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5585
02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:55.290
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty rudimentary.</v>

5586
02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:56.760
<v Speaker 1>One of the things,</v>

5587
02:24:56.761 --> 02:25:01.761
<v Speaker 1>and this is going to seem weird that I've been noticing about a yoga is getting</v>

5588
02:25:02.521 --> 02:25:07.170
<v Speaker 1>into yoga again recently is the various complexities of each position.</v>

5589
02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

5590
02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not as simple as like,</v>

5591
02:25:09.811 --> 02:25:10.531
<v Speaker 1>put your leg here,</v>

5592
02:25:10.531 --> 02:25:11.070
<v Speaker 1>stand up,</v>

5593
02:25:11.070 --> 02:25:16.070
<v Speaker 1>there's like back has to be straight and you expand your chest back,</v>

5594
02:25:16.530 --> 02:25:18.210
<v Speaker 1>push down with your heels,</v>

5595
02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:18.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5596
02:25:18.481 --> 02:25:19.440
<v Speaker 1>push your hips forward.</v>

5597
02:25:19.441 --> 02:25:21.150
<v Speaker 1>There's all these different variables that you have to take.</v>

5598
02:25:21.151 --> 02:25:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Any consideration and every single posture will,</v>

5599
02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>the same</v>

5600
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.760
<v Speaker 2>exists in Jujitsu just on a much more complex level.</v>

5601
02:25:27.761 --> 02:25:31.360
<v Speaker 2>There's so much because you're attacking someone and then they're defending and</v>

5602
02:25:31.361 --> 02:25:35.590
<v Speaker 2>then you're anticipating the defense and setting up a second attack off of that</v>

5603
02:25:35.591 --> 02:25:36.161
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>

5604
02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes the first attack is just to gauge how they will respond.</v>

5605
02:25:40.151 --> 02:25:40.401
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

5606
02:25:40.401 --> 02:25:40.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5607
02:25:40.811 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and there's the chaining,</v>

5608
02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:47.020
<v Speaker 2>all the like Helson Gracie of Steve Maxwell's famous of strength and</v>

5609
02:25:47.021 --> 02:25:47.854
<v Speaker 2>conditioning coach,</v>

5610
02:25:48.050 --> 02:25:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu black belt,</v>

5611
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:50.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5612
02:25:50.130 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 2>been on this podcast a few times,</v>

5613
02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:54.940
<v Speaker 2>described how Helson Gracie describes Jujitsu and he goes,</v>

5614
02:25:54.941 --> 02:25:55.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5615
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:56.291
<v Speaker 2>cause he's got,</v>

5616
02:25:56.291 --> 02:25:56.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5617
02:25:56.501 --> 02:25:58.510
<v Speaker 2>kind of a pre deep accent and he goes,</v>

5618
02:25:58.810 --> 02:25:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you do this,</v>

5619
02:25:59.890 --> 02:26:00.940
<v Speaker 2>then I do that,</v>

5620
02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:02.230
<v Speaker 2>then I do this.</v>

5621
02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Then you do that forever.</v>

5622
02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5623
02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:06.220
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

5624
02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:07.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to describe it.</v>

5625
02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:11.710
<v Speaker 2>And the more you understand about each position,</v>

5626
02:26:11.711 --> 02:26:14.080
<v Speaker 2>the more you understand about where,</v>

5627
02:26:14.081 --> 02:26:15.310
<v Speaker 2>where could things go wrong,</v>

5628
02:26:15.311 --> 02:26:16.061
<v Speaker 2>where can things go,</v>

5629
02:26:16.061 --> 02:26:16.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5630
02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:16.721
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

5631
02:26:16.721 --> 02:26:17.021
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

5632
02:26:17.021 --> 02:26:18.190
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to achieve?</v>

5633
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:19.960
<v Speaker 2>And when you don't know that,</v>

5634
02:26:20.350 --> 02:26:20.860
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

5635
02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:21.930
<v Speaker 2>the way you're describing it,</v>

5636
02:26:21.931 --> 02:26:22.210
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

5637
02:26:22.210 --> 02:26:22.960
<v Speaker 2>what's happening?</v>

5638
02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea how am I this or that.</v>

5639
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:26.530
<v Speaker 2>He did this and it was over.</v>

5640
02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And so my husband was like,</v>

5641
02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:28.601
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

5642
02:26:28.601 --> 02:26:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to fight again,</v>

5643
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 2>like right then afterwards was because I knew that,</v>

5644
02:26:33.130 --> 02:26:33.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5645
02:26:33.570 --> 02:26:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I had chosen exactly the wrong game plan to fight this guy and afterwards we</v>

5646
02:26:36.581 --> 02:26:40.990
<v Speaker 2>became Facebook friends and I see all of his pictures on his Facebook page,</v>

5647
02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Him with gold medals on his chest from winning Jujitsu competition tournament.</v>

5648
02:26:45.491 --> 02:26:45.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5649
02:26:45.821 --> 02:26:47.890
<v Speaker 2>So he's [inaudible] out of my league.</v>

5650
02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:48.773
<v Speaker 2>Is he a black belt?</v>

5651
02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe so.</v>

5652
02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:50.933
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5653
02:26:51.010 --> 02:26:51.521
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

5654
02:26:51.521 --> 02:26:52.410
<v Speaker 2>he was up there.</v>

5655
02:26:53.230 --> 02:26:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Have you considered just really training hard as you did to try to look through?</v>

5656
02:26:57.341 --> 02:26:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do,</v>

5657
02:26:57.860 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5658
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I can get help if I can get healthy and 42 it's tough.</v>

5659
02:27:02.290 --> 02:27:03.123
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

5660
02:27:03.430 --> 02:27:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem with me is know this is why I think I had so many physical</v>

5661
02:27:06.251 --> 02:27:06.731
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

5662
02:27:06.731 --> 02:27:10.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like there is a nature and nurture to flexibility.</v>

5663
02:27:10.450 --> 02:27:10.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5664
02:27:10.691 --> 02:27:11.411
<v Speaker 2>some people have,</v>

5665
02:27:11.411 --> 02:27:11.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5666
02:27:11.591 --> 02:27:13.630
<v Speaker 2>some people have really high vertical leap by just by nature.</v>

5667
02:27:13.631 --> 02:27:13.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5668
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:15.070
<v Speaker 2>some people were really flexible.</v>

5669
02:27:15.071 --> 02:27:15.281
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

5670
02:27:15.281 --> 02:27:20.281
<v Speaker 2>by nature I appear to be the Chi who's not very flexible by nature when I work</v>

5671
02:27:20.291 --> 02:27:20.981
<v Speaker 2>on it really hard.</v>

5672
02:27:20.981 --> 02:27:21.461
<v Speaker 2>But boy,</v>

5673
02:27:21.461 --> 02:27:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I just don't seem to get much more flexibility oppose that because no one in my</v>

5674
02:27:25.031 --> 02:27:26.440
<v Speaker 2>family is flexible by button.</v>

5675
02:27:26.441 --> 02:27:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

5676
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why I'm flexible is because my body developed by stretching.</v>

5677
02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was stretching from the time I was really young.</v>

5678
02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:36.240
<v Speaker 2>That could be a starting when you're young and supple him.</v>

5679
02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:38.620
<v Speaker 2>But when I was in my early twenties you know,</v>

5680
02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:40.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing karate,</v>

5681
02:27:40.390 --> 02:27:42.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff you just can't do if you,</v>

5682
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:44.470
<v Speaker 2>if you're not very flexible.</v>

5683
02:27:44.650 --> 02:27:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And so I worked on really hard.</v>

5684
02:27:45.791 --> 02:27:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Well there was a guy that used to come to our Jujitsu gym.</v>

5685
02:27:48.041 --> 02:27:49.360
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons why I pose it.</v>

5686
02:27:49.361 --> 02:27:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And he was just big fucking football player and he was like 250 pounds.</v>

5687
02:27:53.591 --> 02:27:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And whenever I used to roll with them,</v>

5688
02:27:54.551 --> 02:27:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I used to literally say I'm going to go ride the bull because that was,</v>

5689
02:27:58.030 --> 02:27:58.721
<v Speaker 2>that was what was,</v>

5690
02:27:58.721 --> 02:28:00.880
<v Speaker 2>it was like rolling with him.</v>

5691
02:28:00.881 --> 02:28:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Like he wasn't good.</v>

5692
02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I think I was a brown belt and I think he was a white belt at the time.</v>

5693
02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And so I would always get them.</v>

5694
02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:08.440
<v Speaker 2>But it would be a while.</v>

5695
02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be like,</v>

5696
02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:10.900
<v Speaker 2>ah fuck you,</v>

5697
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:14.290
<v Speaker 2>like hanging onto this guy for a long time and riding the bull.</v>

5698
02:28:14.470 --> 02:28:19.360
<v Speaker 2>But this guy was a dedicated athlete and one of the things that he did was he</v>

5699
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 2>radically improved his while he was there</v>

5700
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:23.540
<v Speaker 3>when he first started out.</v>

5701
02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:26.810
<v Speaker 3>You know how you sit there like with your legs in a butterfly position and you</v>

5702
02:28:26.811 --> 02:28:27.441
<v Speaker 3>try to push your,</v>

5703
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:27.831
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

5704
02:28:27.831 --> 02:28:29.090
<v Speaker 3>your knees down to the ground.</v>

5705
02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:30.740
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't even come close.</v>

5706
02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:32.630
<v Speaker 3>His knees are like stock up like this.</v>

5707
02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:34.220
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't push them down and all,</v>

5708
02:28:34.221 --> 02:28:38.360
<v Speaker 3>but that fucking guy would be there after class for 40 minutes longer than</v>

5709
02:28:38.361 --> 02:28:39.021
<v Speaker 3>anybody else.</v>

5710
02:28:39.021 --> 02:28:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Just stretching,</v>

5711
02:28:40.310 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 3>stretching,</v>

5712
02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:45.200
<v Speaker 3>just pushing his soft tissue to the limit every day.</v>

5713
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:49.310
<v Speaker 3>And it's that kind of dedication that led to a year plus later.</v>

5714
02:28:49.311 --> 02:28:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend Eddie Bravo,</v>

5715
02:28:50.770 --> 02:28:52.990
<v Speaker 3>my Jujitsu instructor as well,</v>

5716
02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:55.310
<v Speaker 3>he always talks about that guy.</v>

5717
02:28:55.311 --> 02:28:57.860
<v Speaker 3>This one guy he fucking put in the time,</v>

5718
02:28:58.150 --> 02:29:00.230
<v Speaker 3>put in the numbers and he got really flexible.</v>

5719
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:00.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5720
02:29:00.891 --> 02:29:03.590
<v Speaker 3>he was almost had a full split after like a year and a half,</v>

5721
02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.370
<v Speaker 3>but it was the kind of dedication that led him to be a football player.</v>

5722
02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a professional athlete and he just,</v>

5723
02:29:09.891 --> 02:29:14.360
<v Speaker 3>this guy just fucking put on the blinders and went for flexibility.</v>

5724
02:29:14.361 --> 02:29:16.580
<v Speaker 3>He knew he was ridiculously strong.</v>

5725
02:29:16.581 --> 02:29:18.440
<v Speaker 3>He knew he was ridiculously powerful.</v>

5726
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:21.790
<v Speaker 3>So he had to learn the technique and you had to get flexible and so he,</v>

5727
02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:22.251
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

5728
02:29:22.251 --> 02:29:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I saw him do it,</v>

5729
02:29:23.121 --> 02:29:23.391
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5730
02:29:23.391 --> 02:29:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I saw it take place.</v>

5731
02:29:24.681 --> 02:29:25.530
<v Speaker 3>So whenever,</v>

5732
02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 3>when someone says they said,</v>

5733
02:29:26.871 --> 02:29:26.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5734
02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you'll have certain restrictions in this certain,</v>

5735
02:29:29.661 --> 02:29:30.500
<v Speaker 3>it was only Sophie.</v>

5736
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:31.341
<v Speaker 3>That's all the time.</v>

5737
02:29:31.341 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 3>You say that not everyone's given the same genetic gifts.</v>

5738
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:35.833
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

5739
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:37.040
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about that.</v>

5740
02:29:37.041 --> 02:29:38.630
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to Fast Eddie Bravo,</v>

5741
02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:38.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5742
02:29:38.881 --> 02:29:40.260
<v Speaker 3>like he's just a freak.</v>

5743
02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:43.150
<v Speaker 3>He has some freakish flexibility in some areas he does,</v>

5744
02:29:43.151 --> 02:29:43.984
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>

5745
02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:47.450
<v Speaker 3>he's stretched those areas ad nauseum.</v>

5746
02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:48.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy,</v>

5747
02:29:48.081 --> 02:29:50.810
<v Speaker 3>you'd be watching TV with him and he's pulling his foot to his chest.</v>

5748
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Like seriously everywhere too though.</v>

5749
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:52.811
<v Speaker 3>I watched,</v>

5750
02:29:52.811 --> 02:29:53.321
<v Speaker 3>I watched TV.</v>

5751
02:29:53.321 --> 02:29:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to instruct the whole time.</v>

5752
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5753
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5754
02:29:55.810 --> 02:29:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much you're stretched.</v>

5755
02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:58.101
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much you stretch,</v>

5756
02:29:58.101 --> 02:30:01.520
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that I watched this guy do it and I watched this guy get way more</v>

5757
02:30:01.521 --> 02:30:02.810
<v Speaker 3>flexible and it was amazing.</v>

5758
02:30:02.811 --> 02:30:05.310
<v Speaker 3>But this is what my point is,</v>

5759
02:30:05.311 --> 02:30:08.540
<v Speaker 3>is like there are unquestionably physical gifts that you can't,</v>

5760
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:10.880
<v Speaker 3>you can't achieve like fast twitch,</v>

5761
02:30:10.881 --> 02:30:11.540
<v Speaker 3>muscle fibers,</v>

5762
02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:14.480
<v Speaker 3>speed and power cardio to cardio.</v>

5763
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Cain Velasquez is the one that they always bring up,</v>

5764
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:19.130
<v Speaker 3>size of bones,</v>

5765
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:20.290
<v Speaker 3>size of the hands,</v>

5766
02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:21.620
<v Speaker 3>the width of the shoulders,</v>

5767
02:30:22.010 --> 02:30:23.990
<v Speaker 3>all those things contribute to power.</v>

5768
02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:26.270
<v Speaker 3>And also like the explosion,</v>

5769
02:30:26.271 --> 02:30:27.170
<v Speaker 3>like the fast guys,</v>

5770
02:30:27.171 --> 02:30:29.060
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like Uriah hall,</v>

5771
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:33.260
<v Speaker 3>like Uriah Hall without a doubt is trained very hard and well prepared and he</v>

5772
02:30:33.261 --> 02:30:34.340
<v Speaker 3>has excellent technique.</v>

5773
02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:37.910
<v Speaker 3>But you watch your Riaa hall shoot a straight right hand and you're like,</v>

5774
02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:38.361
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5775
02:30:38.361 --> 02:30:41.180
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know how many guys can do at that fast.</v>

5776
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:42.080
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>

5777
02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:45.050
<v Speaker 3>he'll be like moving around and all of a sudden you're like,</v>

5778
02:30:45.051 --> 02:30:48.950
<v Speaker 3>lean in with this right hand that cut and you see the look on the guy's face</v>

5779
02:30:48.951 --> 02:30:51.240
<v Speaker 3>after he got hit where he realizes like what just happened?</v>

5780
02:30:51.350 --> 02:30:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

5781
02:30:52.281 --> 02:30:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy's got some next level speed.</v>

5782
02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking to your rise coaches after one of his fights.</v>

5783
02:30:56.781 --> 02:30:56.991
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

5784
02:30:56.991 --> 02:30:58.640
<v Speaker 3>he's the fastest fucking guy I've ever seen.</v>

5785
02:30:59.210 --> 02:31:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Like the fastest guy.</v>

5786
02:31:00.111 --> 02:31:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Like you see him in the gym.</v>

5787
02:31:01.071 --> 02:31:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is so fucking fast and some of that is,</v>

5788
02:31:05.210 --> 02:31:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean some,</v>

5789
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:09.800
<v Speaker 3>some portion of that is unattainable for the average person.</v>

5790
02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5791
02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:12.170
<v Speaker 3>That's just the reality.</v>

5792
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:14.400
<v Speaker 3>But it does.</v>

5793
02:31:14.401 --> 02:31:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Where do you think be different for flexibility?</v>

5794
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I think flexibility is something that you can push because</v>

5795
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:23.180
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of how far your soft cardio toes.</v>

5796
02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:23.611
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5797
02:31:23.611 --> 02:31:24.161
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

5798
02:31:24.161 --> 02:31:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Can't push like crazy.</v>

5799
02:31:25.690 --> 02:31:26.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a linen.</v>

5800
02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Cassidy though is different.</v>

5801
02:31:27.721 --> 02:31:29.520
<v Speaker 2>The size of the heart is different like this.</v>

5802
02:31:29.521 --> 02:31:31.320
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we said about Lance Armstrong,</v>

5803
02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:33.180
<v Speaker 2>he has an enormous heart and that's part of,</v>

5804
02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:33.801
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it.</v>

5805
02:31:33.801 --> 02:31:34.710
<v Speaker 2>The training too though,</v>

5806
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:36.810
<v Speaker 2>could be when you grow the harder to muscle,</v>

5807
02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:38.430
<v Speaker 2>it atrophies.</v>

5808
02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It hypertrophies plus all the shit that he took.</v>

5809
02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Crimes injecting steroids and one of those ones from pulp fiction when they</v>

5810
02:31:47.911 --> 02:31:48.744
<v Speaker 2>revived.</v>

5811
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:53.191
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

5812
02:31:53.191 --> 02:31:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

5813
02:31:53.610 --> 02:31:54.090
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>

5814
02:31:54.090 --> 02:31:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I just think that flexibility is a little bit more simple.</v>

5815
02:31:56.701 --> 02:31:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you could achieve the flexibility of say like you have an anecdote</v>

5816
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:01.050
<v Speaker 2>or you have your big friend.</v>

5817
02:32:01.470 --> 02:32:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that I think I'm,</v>

5818
02:32:02.431 --> 02:32:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the other anecdote might be,</v>

5819
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen you stretch though.</v>

5820
02:32:05.980 --> 02:32:06.660
<v Speaker 2>We'll do it after.</v>

5821
02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5822
02:32:07.170 --> 02:32:07.740
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

5823
02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:08.840
<v Speaker 2>See how hard you push it.</v>

5824
02:32:09.310 --> 02:32:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause some people get to a certain point like Ah,</v>

5825
02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:12.001
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5826
02:32:12.001 --> 02:32:12.211
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5827
02:32:12.211 --> 02:32:12.860
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5828
02:32:12.860 --> 02:32:14.280
<v Speaker 2>but you got to get to that super,</v>

5829
02:32:14.281 --> 02:32:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't breathe point and you gotta push that bitch.</v>

5830
02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:17.953
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

5831
02:32:18.450 --> 02:32:20.400
<v Speaker 2>it's also like how do you do it?</v>

5832
02:32:20.401 --> 02:32:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you do it correctly?</v>

5833
02:32:21.631 --> 02:32:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you have someone who's pushing you correctly in what,</v>

5834
02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:25.260
<v Speaker 2>where are you starting out from?</v>

5835
02:32:25.261 --> 02:32:30.261
<v Speaker 2>You starting out from 39 40 years of doing Jack Shit to stretch out and then all</v>

5836
02:32:30.901 --> 02:32:35.490
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden you're trying to take these mature older muscles and,</v>

5837
02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:36.780
<v Speaker 2>and pull them up on a big part.</v>

5838
02:32:36.810 --> 02:32:37.643
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of that.</v>

5839
02:32:37.650 --> 02:32:38.200
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

5840
02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:40.140
<v Speaker 2>If I've been sitting on a desk for years and years,</v>

5841
02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean if somebody got ahold of you when you were 16,</v>

5842
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.943
<v Speaker 2>that's very possible.</v>

5843
02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:46.250
<v Speaker 2>And when you were doing Kyokushin did,</v>

5844
02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:46.830
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

5845
02:32:46.830 --> 02:32:49.140
<v Speaker 2>did your school really emphasize stretching?</v>

5846
02:32:49.650 --> 02:32:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

5847
02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:50.701
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5848
02:32:50.701 --> 02:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>cause I knew,</v>

5849
02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:54.930
<v Speaker 2>well I knew I couldn't kick guys in the head and I knew I wanted to be able to,</v>

5850
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:55.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5851
02:32:55.291 --> 02:32:56.730
<v Speaker 2>cause that's a big part of it is all kinds of kicks.</v>

5852
02:32:56.731 --> 02:32:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I get all kinds of cool stuff I couldn't do.</v>

5853
02:32:58.740 --> 02:32:59.850
<v Speaker 2>So I got stretching machine,</v>

5854
02:32:59.851 --> 02:33:00.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5855
02:33:00.111 --> 02:33:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5856
02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:01.680
<v Speaker 2>well it was chuck Norris jammies.</v>

5857
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I know chuck north of knockoff version cause it was cheaper.</v>

5858
02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5859
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:06.550
<v Speaker 2>no crank.</v>

5860
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5861
02:33:06.850 --> 02:33:07.530
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a crank.</v>

5862
02:33:07.530 --> 02:33:07.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5863
02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>mine was different was it was like,</v>

5864
02:33:08.991 --> 02:33:11.370
<v Speaker 2>what's some kind of like PVC.</v>

5865
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.881
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5866
02:33:11.881 --> 02:33:12.471
<v Speaker 2>I know that time.</v>

5867
02:33:12.471 --> 02:33:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5868
02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:13.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5869
02:33:13.111 --> 02:33:14.960
<v Speaker 2>It was like a pilot picture par,</v>

5870
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you pull it and stretch exactly those do a little bit,</v>

5871
02:33:18.601 --> 02:33:23.160
<v Speaker 2>but realistically you don't need that which you really need is just someone who</v>

5872
02:33:23.161 --> 02:33:25.080
<v Speaker 2>can help you and push you back down.</v>

5873
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:28.080
<v Speaker 2>And then also the ability to withstand pain.</v>

5874
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:29.281
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

5875
02:33:29.281 --> 02:33:32.640
<v Speaker 2>The uncomfortable feeling of pushing your muscles to limit.</v>

5876
02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5877
02:33:33.450 --> 02:33:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind that it's hard to,</v>

5878
02:33:35.911 --> 02:33:36.211
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5879
02:33:36.211 --> 02:33:38.700
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to change your body in many ways.</v>

5880
02:33:38.701 --> 02:33:42.270
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to develop more muscle because your body doesn't want to,</v>

5881
02:33:42.271 --> 02:33:43.560
<v Speaker 2>your body doesn't want to change.</v>

5882
02:33:43.561 --> 02:33:43.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5883
02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:48.060
<v Speaker 2>your body just wants to get really sore and then discourage you from continuing</v>

5884
02:33:48.061 --> 02:33:51.720
<v Speaker 2>to lift right now in order to force your body to gain weight.</v>

5885
02:33:51.721 --> 02:33:52.501
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone say to me,</v>

5886
02:33:52.501 --> 02:33:52.801
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

5887
02:33:52.801 --> 02:33:56.520
<v Speaker 2>I want to put on about five pounds of muscle while you're going to have to work</v>

5888
02:33:56.521 --> 02:33:57.870
<v Speaker 2>out three days a week,</v>

5889
02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:59.610
<v Speaker 2>like a madman for a year,</v>

5890
02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:00.713
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

5891
02:34:01.010 --> 02:34:01.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5892
02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:03.870
<v Speaker 2>there's one thing if you're a dedicated professional athlete,</v>

5893
02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:06.900
<v Speaker 2>you've been doing it a long time and your body knows how to grow and there's a</v>

5894
02:34:06.901 --> 02:34:11.340
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of also muscle memory that comes into play when you see someone</v>

5895
02:34:11.341 --> 02:34:13.260
<v Speaker 2>who is a really big,</v>

5896
02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:14.530
<v Speaker 2>but then they lose the,</v>

5897
02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:15.660
<v Speaker 2>the muscle mass.</v>

5898
02:34:15.690 --> 02:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they'll get into something else and we'll stop lifting.</v>

5899
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.190
<v Speaker 2>They can get really big way quicker than the average person.</v>

5900
02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:22.811
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

5901
02:34:22.811 --> 02:34:23.644
<v Speaker 2>it's a fact.</v>

5902
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you,</v>

5903
02:34:24.910 --> 02:34:26.890
<v Speaker 2>if you used to weigh 230 pounds,</v>

5904
02:34:26.891 --> 02:34:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you big fucking giant dude and then you dropped down to one 70,</v>

5905
02:34:30.161 --> 02:34:30.911
<v Speaker 2>you could gain,</v>

5906
02:34:30.911 --> 02:34:34.880
<v Speaker 2>like if you took two dudes that weighed one 70 and they're both,</v>

5907
02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:35.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5908
02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.840
<v Speaker 2>reasonably fit and one of them used to be enormous,</v>

5909
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:39.100
<v Speaker 2>he will get bigger quicker.</v>

5910
02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just muscle memory.</v>

5911
02:34:40.410 --> 02:34:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5912
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.590
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

5913
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:42.760
<v Speaker 2>there's no getting around that,</v>

5914
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:45.490
<v Speaker 2>but your body doesn't want to do it.</v>

5915
02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:47.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5916
02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:47.321
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5917
02:34:47.321 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 2>you have to really push that bitch.</v>

5918
02:34:49.330 --> 02:34:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same takes place with flexibility and the same.</v>

5919
02:34:53.350 --> 02:34:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5920
02:34:53.770 --> 02:34:55.930
<v Speaker 2>the same holds true with,</v>

5921
02:34:55.931 --> 02:34:56.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5922
02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:57.130
<v Speaker 2>with gains,</v>

5923
02:34:57.430 --> 02:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>with size gains.</v>

5924
02:34:58.390 --> 02:34:59.590
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to do.</v>

5925
02:34:59.730 --> 02:35:00.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5926
02:35:00.850 --> 02:35:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you have to be willing to push your body to this really uncomfortable position</v>

5927
02:35:04.241 --> 02:35:07.090
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to fuel it with all sorts of food.</v>

5928
02:35:07.930 --> 02:35:08.171
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5929
02:35:08.171 --> 02:35:08.281
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

5930
02:35:08.281 --> 02:35:11.200
<v Speaker 2>didn't kick out of whenever people compare,</v>

5931
02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:12.140
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

5932
02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:16.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing like it happens on my message board on my forum sometimes,</v>

5933
02:35:16.330 --> 02:35:19.540
<v Speaker 2>like people start talking about diets and caloric requirements and then they'll</v>

5934
02:35:19.541 --> 02:35:20.860
<v Speaker 2>bring up like Michael Phelps.</v>

5935
02:35:21.130 --> 02:35:21.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5936
02:35:21.281 --> 02:35:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Michael Phelps ate 15 fucking pizzas a day and he did like,</v>

5937
02:35:25.631 --> 02:35:30.400
<v Speaker 2>do you have any idea how hard Michael Phelps works out?</v>

5938
02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5939
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever fucking compare yourself to Michael to stop.</v>

5940
02:35:34.210 --> 02:35:39.210
<v Speaker 2>He's in the greatest Olympic swimmer the world has ever known and whatever</v>

5941
02:35:39.641 --> 02:35:41.110
<v Speaker 2>genetic gifts he has,</v>

5942
02:35:41.530 --> 02:35:46.300
<v Speaker 2>they were unquestionably accentuated by a barbaric worth ethic.</v>

5943
02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:47.643
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

5944
02:35:48.130 --> 02:35:48.963
<v Speaker 2>those things helped.</v>

5945
02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I think that we'd help them recover and he's six,</v>

5946
02:35:50.901 --> 02:35:52.060
<v Speaker 2>seven or eight big,</v>

5947
02:35:52.061 --> 02:35:54.310
<v Speaker 2>giant fucking long dude.</v>

5948
02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.090
<v Speaker 2>But also the amount of calories that guy was burning every day.</v>

5949
02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:00.640
<v Speaker 2>The average person really can't relate.</v>

5950
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:01.330
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

5951
02:36:01.330 --> 02:36:02.163
<v Speaker 2>you can't relate.</v>

5952
02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:02.590
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5953
02:36:02.590 --> 02:36:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of effort that it takes to be a Chris Weidman,</v>

5954
02:36:06.130 --> 02:36:09.970
<v Speaker 2>the kind of training camps at Vitor Belfort goes through what,</v>

5955
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:10.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5956
02:36:10.301 --> 02:36:12.810
<v Speaker 2>what Jon Jones went through when you train for Daniel Columbian.</v>

5957
02:36:12.810 --> 02:36:13.643
<v Speaker 2>It'd be interesting when,</v>

5958
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:14.100
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

5959
02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:15.460
<v Speaker 2>with the stronger drug testing,</v>

5960
02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:18.400
<v Speaker 2>see if these guys can go through these kinds of camps.</v>

5961
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:19.840
<v Speaker 2>You've got a very good point.</v>

5962
02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5963
02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:21.311
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the,</v>

5964
02:36:21.311 --> 02:36:22.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the dirty secret,</v>

5965
02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:23.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5966
02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.880
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of being slowly but surely revealed for the longest time.</v>

5967
02:36:27.881 --> 02:36:29.770
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things that you couldn't test for,</v>

5968
02:36:29.771 --> 02:36:30.790
<v Speaker 2>like growth hormone.</v>

5969
02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:32.020
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't even find it.</v>

5970
02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:33.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5971
02:36:33.010 --> 02:36:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with jail son and after he got popped and,</v>

5972
02:36:37.121 --> 02:36:37.391
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5973
02:36:37.391 --> 02:36:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5974
02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:40.690
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to talk to me on the phone about like how we should approach it.</v>

5975
02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

5976
02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Chels a funny guy,</v>

5977
02:36:42.671 --> 02:36:43.504
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5978
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:44.980
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking hilarious.</v>

5979
02:36:45.010 --> 02:36:46.480
<v Speaker 2>He's a great shit talker too.</v>

5980
02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:47.081
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5981
02:36:47.081 --> 02:36:47.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5982
02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:47.831
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

5983
02:36:47.831 --> 02:36:48.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5984
02:36:48.131 --> 02:36:48.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5985
02:36:48.341 --> 02:36:51.130
<v Speaker 2>those drug tests turns out they're really good,</v>

5986
02:36:52.890 --> 02:36:55.870
<v Speaker 2>got caught for all sorts of shit that he never thought he'd get caught for</v>

5987
02:36:56.410 --> 02:36:58.210
<v Speaker 2>growth hormone EPO.</v>

5988
02:36:58.440 --> 02:36:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Aw,</v>

5989
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:59.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5990
02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:00.250
<v Speaker 2>He had a cocktail going,</v>

5991
02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:01.841
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

5992
02:37:01.841 --> 02:37:02.621
<v Speaker 2>in his mind,</v>

5993
02:37:02.621 --> 02:37:07.621
<v Speaker 2>I think he had a very small window to achieve something and he probably was</v>

5994
02:37:09.641 --> 02:37:12.310
<v Speaker 2>correct in assuming that he wasn't the only one doing it.</v>

5995
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:13.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5996
02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:16.340
<v Speaker 2>You just probably correct in assuming that it's almost impossible,</v>

5997
02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:17.481
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible,</v>

5998
02:37:17.481 --> 02:37:19.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's really hard to get to win the belt,</v>

5999
02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:20.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6000
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.960
<v Speaker 2>without it.</v>

6001
02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6002
02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Josie Aldo had a really interesting thing to say.</v>

6003
02:37:24.410 --> 02:37:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6004
02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:27.240
<v Speaker 2>and Andre Panera's as well.</v>

6005
02:37:27.350 --> 02:37:28.250
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about,</v>

6006
02:37:28.251 --> 02:37:28.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6007
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>steroids and they were like,</v>

6008
02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:31.153
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6009
02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>we support testing,</v>

6010
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:36.500
<v Speaker 2>but I hope the UFC realizes the fights won't be as exciting.</v>

6011
02:37:37.290 --> 02:37:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Like if fighters won't be as good,</v>

6012
02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:38.991
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6013
02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:41.720
<v Speaker 2>they're also going to be out of fights more often know they're awesome not to be</v>

6014
02:37:41.721 --> 02:37:42.171
<v Speaker 2>able to make it,</v>

6015
02:37:42.171 --> 02:37:43.004
<v Speaker 2>to fight it.</v>

6016
02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to have the healing.</v>

6017
02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6018
02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:45.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6019
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:48.020
<v Speaker 2>You know your wife at all that testosterone.</v>

6020
02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:48.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6021
02:37:48.391 --> 02:37:51.440
<v Speaker 2>You're red lining your body going through camp and they bang,</v>

6022
02:37:51.441 --> 02:37:51.831
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

6023
02:37:51.831 --> 02:37:52.491
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

6024
02:37:52.491 --> 02:37:55.370
<v Speaker 2>things fucking break off and selling example think they can work.</v>

6025
02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:58.220
<v Speaker 2>That's hard as they're working without some help.</v>

6026
02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Some can,</v>

6027
02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:00.650
<v Speaker 2>some Canada summer clean,</v>

6028
02:38:00.651 --> 02:38:01.700
<v Speaker 2>some have always been clean.</v>

6029
02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Guys like Frankie Edgar,</v>

6030
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:04.640
<v Speaker 2>these finger clean turn out not to be,</v>

6031
02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:04.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6032
02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:05.753
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

6033
02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I think fake Edgar's almost certainly clean,</v>

6034
02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:11.450
<v Speaker 2>but who knows if he's not eating EPL and that's,</v>

6035
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:11.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6036
02:38:11.851 --> 02:38:13.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the secrets to his incredible cardio.</v>

6037
02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that at all.</v>

6038
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:16.280
<v Speaker 2>But you wouldn't know it was my point.</v>

6039
02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:17.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6040
02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:17.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6041
02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:18.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6042
02:38:18.351 --> 02:38:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean John Fitch Really surprised me when he turned positive.</v>

6043
02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Tons of people are surprised.</v>

6044
02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:23.131
<v Speaker 2>The Anderson Silva.</v>

6045
02:38:23.131 --> 02:38:23.781
<v Speaker 2>It was surprising.</v>

6046
02:38:23.781 --> 02:38:24.614
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6047
02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could tell you that.</v>

6048
02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you off the air.</v>

6049
02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6050
02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you on the air the Anderson Silva situation,</v>

6051
02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bit more complicated.</v>

6052
02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6053
02:38:32.060 --> 02:38:32.893
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

6054
02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:35.270
<v Speaker 2>he unquestionably took some for his,</v>

6055
02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:35.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6056
02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:37.940
<v Speaker 2>leg to try to heal his leg.</v>

6057
02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:38.840
<v Speaker 2>38 years old.</v>

6058
02:38:38.841 --> 02:38:40.420
<v Speaker 2>He had a broken leg in that position.</v>

6059
02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:41.833
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>

6060
02:38:41.900 --> 02:38:42.740
<v Speaker 2>And there's also,</v>

6061
02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is,</v>

6062
02:38:44.691 --> 02:38:46.040
<v Speaker 2>nothing is my opinion.</v>

6063
02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that it is,</v>

6064
02:38:47.810 --> 02:38:49.340
<v Speaker 2>not only is there nothing wrong,</v>

6065
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:54.670
<v Speaker 2>but there may be a case for doctors to prescribe some sort of steroids,</v>

6066
02:38:55.391 --> 02:38:56.780
<v Speaker 2>some controlled amount of,</v>

6067
02:38:56.781 --> 02:39:01.781
<v Speaker 2>some sort of steroids for catastrophic injuries like massive leg breaks or you</v>

6068
02:39:01.991 --> 02:39:02.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

6069
02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Peck terrors or there's some pretty fucking significant injuries.</v>

6070
02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Here's another one.</v>

6071
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6072
02:39:08.270 --> 02:39:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Hector Lombard went through a bulging disc,</v>

6073
02:39:11.420 --> 02:39:12.080
<v Speaker 2>like a sick,</v>

6074
02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.160
<v Speaker 2>significantly injured disc and then was fighting,</v>

6075
02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:16.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6076
02:39:16.581 --> 02:39:18.620
<v Speaker 2>like I think he had a fight scheduled like six months later.</v>

6077
02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Good luck trying to recover from something like that in six months.</v>

6078
02:39:22.491 --> 02:39:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean you kind of can,</v>

6079
02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 2>but can you recover enough in three months to go through a three month ramp?</v>

6080
02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Most likely not.</v>

6081
02:39:29.060 --> 02:39:33.020
<v Speaker 2>And then he turned up positive for some designer steroid that most people didn't</v>

6082
02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:34.160
<v Speaker 2>think they were testing for.</v>

6083
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:35.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6084
02:39:35.181 --> 02:39:38.660
<v Speaker 2>like the whole Barry bonds thing with the clear and all this,</v>

6085
02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:38.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6086
02:39:38.901 --> 02:39:39.350
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

6087
02:39:39.350 --> 02:39:40.760
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of that going on.</v>

6088
02:39:40.761 --> 02:39:42.310
<v Speaker 2>I think inboxing,</v>

6089
02:39:42.410 --> 02:39:43.760
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of that going on.</v>

6090
02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:44.653
<v Speaker 2>There's tons of it.</v>

6091
02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean the big giveaway.</v>

6092
02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:47.360
<v Speaker 2>So if all these old guys,</v>

6093
02:39:48.010 --> 02:39:50.690
<v Speaker 2>these guys in their forties still competing as cage fighters,</v>

6094
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:52.900
<v Speaker 2>well that doesn't really exist anymore.</v>

6095
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:53.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

6096
02:39:53.301 --> 02:39:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Randy was like kind of the last one that competed at a super high level,</v>

6097
02:39:57.650 --> 02:39:58.640
<v Speaker 2>just able to do it at all.</v>

6098
02:39:58.641 --> 02:39:59.474
<v Speaker 2>And that sport,</v>

6099
02:39:59.890 --> 02:40:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you're for Nannies,</v>

6100
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:05.950
<v Speaker 2>also an undeniable freak of nature because Randy never got hurt and mean Randy</v>

6101
02:40:06.021 --> 02:40:07.670
<v Speaker 2>lost and he got knocked out and stuff like that.</v>

6102
02:40:07.671 --> 02:40:08.540
<v Speaker 2>But I mean in training,</v>

6103
02:40:08.541 --> 02:40:10.070
<v Speaker 2>like he never had a surgery,</v>

6104
02:40:10.470 --> 02:40:11.560
<v Speaker 2>never had a broken hand.</v>

6105
02:40:11.561 --> 02:40:13.230
<v Speaker 2>You got his arm broken in the Gonzaga Phi,</v>

6106
02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 2>but that was blocking</v>

6107
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:14.760
<v Speaker 3>a kick.</v>

6108
02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:17.220
<v Speaker 3>He looked awfully good for 50 it's a fucking stud.</v>

6109
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:18.293
<v Speaker 3>He's a God damn.</v>

6110
02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:19.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's key.</v>

6111
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:20.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the real captain America,</v>

6112
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Randy couture's a fucking stud.</v>

6113
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:24.030
<v Speaker 3>You have to be to be able to,</v>

6114
02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:28.500
<v Speaker 3>don't you assume that he was on something in that era?</v>

6115
02:40:29.010 --> 02:40:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes and no.</v>

6116
02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the evidence.</v>

6117
02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

6118
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I assume that it's very likely.</v>

6119
02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6120
02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

6121
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I've said the same thing about fate or,</v>

6122
02:40:37.321 --> 02:40:40.440
<v Speaker 3>and people got mad at me faint or fought in a dirty league.</v>

6123
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:41.880
<v Speaker 3>He fought in pride.</v>

6124
02:40:41.881 --> 02:40:42.870
<v Speaker 3>It was a dirty league.</v>

6125
02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:43.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean ensign anyway,</v>

6126
02:40:43.891 --> 02:40:45.210
<v Speaker 3>sat in a very safe seat.</v>

6127
02:40:45.211 --> 02:40:49.170
<v Speaker 3>You're sitting in and it was laughing about his contract for pride where they</v>

6128
02:40:49.171 --> 02:40:51.780
<v Speaker 3>told him that we don't test for steroids.</v>

6129
02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that that fade or was not on it?</v>

6130
02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:54.541
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6131
02:40:54.541 --> 02:40:55.141
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that.</v>

6132
02:40:55.141 --> 02:40:57.330
<v Speaker 3>But when you have a league where everyone's on it,</v>

6133
02:40:57.331 --> 02:40:59.250
<v Speaker 3>like Vander lay was without a doubt.</v>

6134
02:40:59.250 --> 02:41:01.170
<v Speaker 3>And I said one of my favorite fighters of all time.</v>

6135
02:41:01.171 --> 02:41:02.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not my number one favorite.</v>

6136
02:41:02.401 --> 02:41:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6137
02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Like when I get excited to watch a fight,</v>

6138
02:41:04.801 --> 02:41:05.880
<v Speaker 3>when Vandelay was fighting,</v>

6139
02:41:05.881 --> 02:41:07.890
<v Speaker 3>it was probably the most excited you you can get.</v>

6140
02:41:08.490 --> 02:41:08.851
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

6141
02:41:08.851 --> 02:41:10.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just like you knew it was just going to be chaos,</v>

6142
02:41:10.930 --> 02:41:11.830
<v Speaker 3>just such a marker,</v>

6143
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:12.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6144
02:41:12.350 --> 02:41:13.620
<v Speaker 3>he was terrifying,</v>

6145
02:41:13.650 --> 02:41:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but he was obviously on some shit obviously.</v>

6146
02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:17.040
<v Speaker 3>And the vendor laid that,</v>

6147
02:41:17.041 --> 02:41:19.020
<v Speaker 3>showed up with the UFC was not the same guy.</v>

6148
02:41:19.021 --> 02:41:20.630
<v Speaker 3>He just wasn't me.</v>

6149
02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Still had that warrior's heart.</v>

6150
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:24.780
<v Speaker 3>But his body just did not cooperate the same way.</v>

6151
02:41:24.781 --> 02:41:28.350
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of is probably because his endocrine system is all fucked up from</v>

6152
02:41:28.351 --> 02:41:29.550
<v Speaker 3>years of using stuff.</v>

6153
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.863
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

6154
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:31.261
<v Speaker 3>Waze,</v>

6155
02:41:31.261 --> 02:41:31.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6156
02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

6157
02:41:32.610 --> 02:41:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6158
02:41:33.330 --> 02:41:33.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6159
02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:33.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6160
02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:34.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm just guessing.</v>

6161
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm just totally guessing.</v>

6162
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:40.590
<v Speaker 3>The Vandelay one Vandelay ran away from a drug test too and now a suspended</v>

6163
02:41:40.591 --> 02:41:41.221
<v Speaker 3>indefinitely,</v>

6164
02:41:41.221 --> 02:41:42.780
<v Speaker 3>which I think is kind of fucked up.</v>

6165
02:41:43.230 --> 02:41:43.501
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

6166
02:41:43.501 --> 02:41:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I think if they should have,</v>

6167
02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:46.770
<v Speaker 3>they should have the worst they could give you.</v>

6168
02:41:46.771 --> 02:41:48.130
<v Speaker 3>At the time she tested positive.</v>

6169
02:41:48.131 --> 02:41:48.964
<v Speaker 3>It was like a year.</v>

6170
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:50.370
<v Speaker 3>They should have given him a year.</v>

6171
02:41:50.730 --> 02:41:51.331
<v Speaker 3>They should have said,</v>

6172
02:41:51.331 --> 02:41:51.930
<v Speaker 3>look dude,</v>

6173
02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:53.490
<v Speaker 3>we know what the fuck is going on.</v>

6174
02:41:53.491 --> 02:41:54.510
<v Speaker 3>And then if that's the case,</v>

6175
02:41:54.511 --> 02:41:55.890
<v Speaker 3>he'd already be fighting again by now.</v>

6176
02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:56.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6177
02:41:56.251 --> 02:41:58.200
<v Speaker 3>you could treat it just like that's a concession.</v>

6178
02:41:58.320 --> 02:41:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I can see that I'm using,</v>

6179
02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.070
<v Speaker 3>if I run,</v>

6180
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:01.200
<v Speaker 3>if I run a concede.</v>

6181
02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:01.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6182
02:42:01.591 --> 02:42:03.750
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to make an example out of him and they said,</v>

6183
02:42:03.751 --> 02:42:03.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6184
02:42:03.961 --> 02:42:05.310
<v Speaker 3>we're going to give you a lifetime ban.</v>

6185
02:42:05.311 --> 02:42:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Well that's fucked up,</v>

6186
02:42:06.391 --> 02:42:06.661
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

6187
02:42:06.661 --> 02:42:07.530
<v Speaker 3>because this guy,</v>

6188
02:42:07.531 --> 02:42:08.720
<v Speaker 3>this is his life is,</v>

6189
02:42:08.721 --> 02:42:08.911
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

6190
02:42:08.911 --> 02:42:09.750
<v Speaker 3>is living.</v>

6191
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:13.080
<v Speaker 3>You essentially took away his living from one violation,</v>

6192
02:42:13.081 --> 02:42:17.430
<v Speaker 3>the only violation of his entire professional career.</v>

6193
02:42:18.030 --> 02:42:18.421
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>

6194
02:42:18.421 --> 02:42:19.860
<v Speaker 3>suspicions aside,</v>

6195
02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:23.760
<v Speaker 3>and there's certainly suspicions of when he was competing in pride and even</v>

6196
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:26.430
<v Speaker 3>possibly suspicions of when he's competing in the UFC.</v>

6197
02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:30.940
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is the guy never got caught except for the one time where he</v>

6198
02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:31.511
<v Speaker 3>evaded it,</v>

6199
02:42:31.511 --> 02:42:32.160
<v Speaker 3>test,</v>

6200
02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:34.050
<v Speaker 3>treat it like it's a positive test.</v>

6201
02:42:34.530 --> 02:42:34.891
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

6202
02:42:34.891 --> 02:42:35.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6203
02:42:35.131 --> 02:42:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I get the whole idea of sending a fucking message,</v>

6204
02:42:38.191 --> 02:42:40.230
<v Speaker 3>but that message is long been set.</v>

6205
02:42:40.290 --> 02:42:45.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody knows you if you test positive and then you see the new testing</v>

6206
02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:46.590
<v Speaker 3>rules that they pulled out,</v>

6207
02:42:47.130 --> 02:42:48.630
<v Speaker 3>their new ones are brutal.</v>

6208
02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:49.980
<v Speaker 3>The new ones are three years,</v>

6209
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.940
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>

6210
02:42:50.941 --> 02:42:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are lifestyle.</v>

6211
02:42:52.111 --> 02:42:53.250
<v Speaker 3>It's lifetime.</v>

6212
02:42:53.251 --> 02:42:54.270
<v Speaker 3>If you have a second,</v>

6213
02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:54.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6214
02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:55.021
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6215
02:42:55.021 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 3>if you try to run away from a test a second time,</v>

6216
02:42:58.861 --> 02:43:01.230
<v Speaker 3>he tried to run away from a test sell lifetime suspension,</v>

6217
02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:03.230
<v Speaker 3>but three years for a first offense,</v>

6218
02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:04.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was three years,</v>

6219
02:43:04.770 --> 02:43:05.461
<v Speaker 3>two years,</v>

6220
02:43:05.461 --> 02:43:06.241
<v Speaker 3>I think it's two years,</v>

6221
02:43:06.241 --> 02:43:07.620
<v Speaker 3>three years for a second offense,</v>

6222
02:43:07.650 --> 02:43:08.280
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

6223
02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Almost a career under not only that,</v>

6224
02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:13.360
<v Speaker 3>they take 75% of your purse up to 75% of your purse.</v>

6225
02:43:13.390 --> 02:43:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6226
02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:14.740
<v Speaker 3>there's some big ones.</v>

6227
02:43:14.770 --> 02:43:16.480
<v Speaker 3>If you take three years out of a guy's prime,</v>

6228
02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.380
<v Speaker 3>especially a guy in his late and late thirties like an Anderson,</v>

6229
02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:22.720
<v Speaker 3>like Anderson Anderson's going through,</v>

6230
02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:26.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they give him a year and a half and he's fighting against it.</v>

6231
02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:29.090
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk in about 10 minutes and I'll give you the whole rundown of what I</v>

6232
02:43:29.091 --> 02:43:30.570
<v Speaker 3>actually know because you'll,</v>

6233
02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:31.060
<v Speaker 3>you'll go,</v>

6234
02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:32.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6235
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:33.063
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could tell you.</v>

6236
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.611
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

6237
02:43:33.611 --> 02:43:35.230
<v Speaker 3>First offense for testosterone,</v>

6238
02:43:35.231 --> 02:43:36.280
<v Speaker 3>antibiotic steroids,</v>

6239
02:43:36.281 --> 02:43:37.114
<v Speaker 3>Hgh,</v>

6240
02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.860
<v Speaker 3>36 month suspension,</v>

6241
02:43:38.861 --> 02:43:43.420
<v Speaker 3>find a 50 to 75% second offense for fucking years.</v>

6242
02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:46.690
<v Speaker 3>75 to 100% of fighters purse.</v>

6243
02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:47.620
<v Speaker 3>Third Offense,</v>

6244
02:43:47.770 --> 02:43:49.120
<v Speaker 3>lifetime suspension,</v>

6245
02:43:49.121 --> 02:43:53.890
<v Speaker 3>fine of 100% avoiding first offense for years,</v>

6246
02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:56.080
<v Speaker 3>fine of 75% second offense,</v>

6247
02:43:56.081 --> 02:43:57.220
<v Speaker 3>lifetime suspension,</v>

6248
02:43:57.221 --> 02:43:59.050
<v Speaker 3>fine of 100% of fighters purse.</v>

6249
02:43:59.710 --> 02:44:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6250
02:44:00.210 --> 02:44:01.300
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that'll be enough.</v>

6251
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I guess the idea is we're going to hang you,</v>

6252
02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:08.260
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to set up a sort of almost a zero tolerance policy in order to</v>

6253
02:44:08.261 --> 02:44:09.400
<v Speaker 3>scare guys street.</v>

6254
02:44:09.430 --> 02:44:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Well Bron Rhonda Rousey had a very good point and this point is that if someone</v>

6255
02:44:18.101 --> 02:44:23.101
<v Speaker 3>uses some sort of antibiotic steroid and they can hit their opponent more and</v>

6256
02:44:24.401 --> 02:44:25.750
<v Speaker 3>then that opponent dies.</v>

6257
02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:26.643
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

6258
02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.090
<v Speaker 3>This is that is that murder or manslaughter?</v>

6259
02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:32.050
<v Speaker 3>She's very good point.</v>

6260
02:44:32.370 --> 02:44:33.850
<v Speaker 3>And you guys are already super heroes.</v>

6261
02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

6262
02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Need juice them up and yeah,</v>

6263
02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:36.491
<v Speaker 3>that's dangerous.</v>

6264
02:44:36.491 --> 02:44:36.940
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

6265
02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:37.271
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

6266
02:44:37.271 --> 02:44:37.991
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly,</v>

6267
02:44:37.991 --> 02:44:41.110
<v Speaker 3>if you're on EPO and human growth hormone and testosterone,</v>

6268
02:44:41.111 --> 02:44:45.160
<v Speaker 3>you can most certainly hit someone more than you would be able to if you are not</v>

6269
02:44:45.161 --> 02:44:45.994
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>

6270
02:44:46.090 --> 02:44:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Especially if like these cases where guys are testing with like literally</v>

6271
02:44:50.171 --> 02:44:51.730
<v Speaker 3>superhuman levels,</v>

6272
02:44:52.090 --> 02:44:53.740
<v Speaker 3>like v tour when they,</v>

6273
02:44:53.770 --> 02:44:58.770
<v Speaker 3>when they eventually rescinded the testosterone replacement therapy thing from</v>

6274
02:44:58.921 --> 02:44:59.351
<v Speaker 3>Nevada,</v>

6275
02:44:59.351 --> 02:45:00.280
<v Speaker 3>when they tested him,</v>

6276
02:45:00.610 --> 02:45:05.610
<v Speaker 3>he was at 1,475 an average man in his prime is like around 500 to like 800 for</v>

6277
02:45:09.191 --> 02:45:10.270
<v Speaker 3>some crazy stud.</v>

6278
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:13.480
<v Speaker 3>So he was like essentially like double a human being.</v>

6279
02:45:13.540 --> 02:45:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

6280
02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:15.310
<v Speaker 3>The level of testosterone.</v>

6281
02:45:15.311 --> 02:45:16.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's crazy.</v>

6282
02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6283
02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Nevada judge overturns Vandelia Silva's lifetime ban.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Two 30 Vandelay Silva won a major victory in court today with a Nevada district</v>

6295
02:45:35.381 --> 02:45:37.300
<v Speaker 3>judge throwing out the lifetime ban.</v>

6296
02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I will applaud.</v>

6297
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:43.950
<v Speaker 3>I applaud that ESPN is Brett Okamoto reported via Twitter that the judge did</v>

6298
02:45:44.861 --> 02:45:48.370
<v Speaker 3>agree that the Nevada state afflict the plot of state athletic commission had</v>

6299
02:45:48.371 --> 02:45:52.480
<v Speaker 3>jurisdiction over silver despite being an unlicensed athlete at the time,</v>

6300
02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:56.470
<v Speaker 3>but that there was not sufficient evidence to support a lifetime ban.</v>

6301
02:45:56.500 --> 02:45:57.333
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

6302
02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.880
<v Speaker 3>35 12 and one MMA five and seven in the UFC was handed a hefty punishment after</v>

6303
02:46:04.001 --> 02:46:05.300
<v Speaker 3>he ran from random drug tests.</v>

6304
02:46:05.301 --> 02:46:06.134
<v Speaker 3>But pepper prepare.</v>

6305
02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:07.090
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

6306
02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 3>this is so they overturn the the</v>

6307
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:10.970
<v Speaker 2>lifetime ban,</v>

6308
02:46:10.971 --> 02:46:12.710
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that he's been reinstated.</v>

6309
02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Not reinstated.</v>

6310
02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:14.930
<v Speaker 2>But what's good.</v>

6311
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6312
02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:16.700
<v Speaker 2>is he still under contract with the UFC?</v>

6313
02:46:16.701 --> 02:46:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Like the USC wouldn't even let him.</v>

6314
02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:22.040
<v Speaker 2>He said he made a bunch of like really critical videos about the UFC,</v>

6315
02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:24.081
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

6316

<v Speaker 2>a lot of these guys,</v>

6317

6323
02:46:30.831 --> 02:46:32.090
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

6324
02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

6325
02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:36.830
<v Speaker 2>He was a banned for life while also he was talking about the UFC,</v>

6326
02:46:36.831 --> 02:46:39.050
<v Speaker 2>treating people like slaves and then you know,</v>

6346
02:47:01.071 --> 02:47:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Like when I know him,</v>

6349
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:04.551
<v Speaker 2>I always like to see him.</v>

6350
02:47:04.551 --> 02:47:05.211
<v Speaker 2>He's a very warm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

6355
02:47:11.571 --> 02:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>that's what's so fascinating about people that I can,</v>

6356
02:47:13.441 --> 02:47:13.671
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6357
02:47:13.671 --> 02:47:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

6358
02:47:14.050 --> 02:47:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I had some friends from my gym who trained with Vandelay Jam.</v>

6359
02:47:17.091 --> 02:47:17.900
<v Speaker 2>They all love him.</v>

6360
02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:18.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's a nice guy.</v>

6363
02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:22.280
<v Speaker 2>But he spars like it's life or death.</v>

6364
02:47:22.730 --> 02:47:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Like there's videos of him sparring.</v>

6365
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.831
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about this.</v>

6366
02:47:24.831 --> 02:47:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6367
02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Jeez,</v>

6368

<v Speaker 2>that was the real stone age.</v>

6369
02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Or was that shoe box?</v>

6370
02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:29.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6371
02:47:29.061 --> 02:47:30.520
<v Speaker 2>shoot the box box.</v>

6372
02:47:30.570 --> 02:47:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he should have boxed mean.</v>

6378
02:47:34.581 --> 02:47:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Does it mean shoot inbox?</v>

6379
02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:36.050
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

6380
02:47:36.050 --> 02:47:36.791
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

6381
02:47:36.791 --> 02:47:37.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

6382
02:47:37.610 --> 02:47:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's obviously a Portuguese version probably of shoot box,</v>

6383
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:41.571
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

6384
02:47:41.571 --> 02:47:42.404
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6385
02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:42.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6386
02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:46.580
<v Speaker 2>that's how John Danaher describes MMA shoot boxing,</v>

6387
02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6388
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:48.470
<v Speaker 2>shoot box rules,</v>

6389
02:47:48.471 --> 02:47:51.530
<v Speaker 2>the rules of engagement and the way you approach it and think it.</v>

6390
02:47:52.070 --> 02:47:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that what,</v>

6391
02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:53.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6392
02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:58.550
<v Speaker 2>what they did at shoot box was established like the most aggressive,</v>

6393
02:47:58.551 --> 02:48:00.950
<v Speaker 2>most intimidating team ever.</v>

6394
02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:02.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6395
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:07.000
<v Speaker 2>especially at that time they were just all berserkers Vander lay show,</v>

6396
02:48:07.371 --> 02:48:08.810
<v Speaker 2>gun Ninja,</v>

6397
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Anderson pay lay.</v>

6398
02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:14.960
<v Speaker 2>There was just one killer after another in their primes in their prize.</v>

6399
02:48:15.290 --> 02:48:16.041
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

6400
02:48:16.041 --> 02:48:21.041
<v Speaker 2>Hofeld Codero guy who's gone from that gym and now is training like for Breeshia</v>

6401
02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:21.980
<v Speaker 2>for doom,</v>

6402
02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:26.180

6403
02:48:26.181 --> 02:48:27.200
<v Speaker 2>increased his striking.</v>

6404
02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:28.610
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

6405
02:48:28.611 --> 02:48:31.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not just like that attitude and that drive.</v>

6406
02:48:31.341 --> 02:48:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It's also skill.</v>

6407
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys are very skillful and they just also know about,</v>

6408
02:48:35.930 --> 02:48:38.540
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't know about putting pressure on motherfuckers.</v>

6409
02:48:38.930 --> 02:48:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll sign Angeles versus pedis.</v>

6410
02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:42.870
<v Speaker 2>That was just aggression and pressure.</v>

6411
02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:43.713
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6412
02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:44.840
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

6413
02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:45.531
<v Speaker 2>after that fight,</v>

6414
02:48:45.531 --> 02:48:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I've got nick curse on the guy who trained him and his strength and conditioning</v>

6415
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:49.700
<v Speaker 2>a up,</v>

6416
02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I think he's here next week or from her and and uh,</v>

6417
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:54.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6418
02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:54.501
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

6419
02:48:54.501 --> 02:48:55.430
<v Speaker 2>He's here on Wednesday.</v>

6420
02:48:55.820 --> 02:48:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6421
02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:56.601
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

6422
02:48:56.601 --> 02:49:00.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm really interested to talk to him about it because his,</v>

6423
02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:01.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6424
02:49:01.070 --> 02:49:06.070
<v Speaker 2>his style of training fighters he learned from the Marinovich has the same guy</v>

6425
02:49:06.501 --> 02:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>that got Bj Penn in the best shape of his life back when he fought like Diego</v>

6426
02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Sanchez that Bj,</v>

6427
02:49:12.090 --> 02:49:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the greatest fighters of all time.</v>

6428
02:49:14.431 --> 02:49:15.450
<v Speaker 2>For sure Bj Penn.</v>

6429
02:49:15.451 --> 02:49:17.400
<v Speaker 2>But I think that Bj's the prime BJ.</v>

6430
02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6431
02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:18.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6432
02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.011
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

6433
02:49:19.011 --> 02:49:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm really curious to see what their approach was to get a guy in the kind of</v>

6434
02:49:22.411 --> 02:49:26.610
<v Speaker 2>condition where he could fight five retarded hard rounds like that.</v>

6435
02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:28.680
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how it's possible.</v>

6436
02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it's possible in the amateur divisions.</v>

6437
02:49:30.451 --> 02:49:33.060
<v Speaker 2>We did two minute rounds and if you were in a,</v>

6438
02:49:33.260 --> 02:49:33.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6439
02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:37.710
<v Speaker 2>it really intense rounds we striking was heavy and you're mixing the grappling</v>

6440
02:49:37.711 --> 02:49:38.011
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

6441
02:49:38.011 --> 02:49:39.580
<v Speaker 2>All the heavy exertion of grappling.</v>

6442
02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:41.393
<v Speaker 2>I was more,</v>

6443
02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:42.750
<v Speaker 2>you talked about having a heart attack,</v>

6444
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:43.770
<v Speaker 2>doing hot yoga.</v>

6445
02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I felt that way all the time.</v>

6446
02:49:44.941 --> 02:49:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to die.</v>

6447
02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:49.530
<v Speaker 2>And I watch these guys on TV doing five minute rounds after five minute rounds</v>

6448
02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:52.770
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes walking back to their corners have this crazy round with their</v>

6449
02:49:52.771 --> 02:49:54.000
<v Speaker 2>mouths closed,</v>

6450
02:49:54.390 --> 02:49:56.370
<v Speaker 2>breathing calmly through their noses.</v>

6451
02:49:56.910 --> 02:49:57.331
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

6452
02:49:57.331 --> 02:49:59.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the most freakish thing about these athletes.</v>

6453
02:50:00.330 --> 02:50:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch Neil Magni this weekend?</v>

6454
02:50:02.610 --> 02:50:02.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6455
02:50:02.791 --> 02:50:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6456
02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:03.941
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

6457
02:50:03.941 --> 02:50:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I actually listened to the fight companion.</v>

6458
02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:06.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude,</v>

6459
02:50:06.301 --> 02:50:09.240
<v Speaker 2>it was Neil magnes got insane fucking cardio.</v>

6460
02:50:09.270 --> 02:50:10.100
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

6461
02:50:10.100 --> 02:50:10.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6462
02:50:10.301 --> 02:50:11.134
<v Speaker 2>one of them do.</v>

6463
02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Benson Henderson Henderson has these frenetic finds,</v>

6464
02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:16.170
<v Speaker 2>tons of grappling,</v>

6465
02:50:16.171 --> 02:50:17.010
<v Speaker 2>tons of striking.</v>

6466
02:50:17.310 --> 02:50:18.330
<v Speaker 2>He has never tired.</v>

6467
02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:20.400
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what it's like to be tired of these work ethic.</v>

6468
02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Just insane work ethic and never getting out of shape and never abusing your</v>

6469
02:50:24.391 --> 02:50:26.940
<v Speaker 2>body and always eating the right foods,</v>

6470
02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:28.080
<v Speaker 2>getting the right rest,</v>

6471
02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:32.760
<v Speaker 2>putting altitude tents up in your house is Neil actually trains at altitude.</v>

6472
02:50:32.761 --> 02:50:33.960
<v Speaker 2>He trains as in Denver,</v>

6473
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.950
<v Speaker 2>in altitude MMA.</v>

6474
02:50:34.951 --> 02:50:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Actually that's his gym in Denver.</v>

6475
02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:37.441
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

6476
02:50:37.441 --> 02:50:37.891
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

6477
02:50:37.891 --> 02:50:39.570
<v Speaker 2>there's an advantage in that for sure.</v>

6478
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:40.471
<v Speaker 2>It's an advantage.</v>

6479
02:50:40.471 --> 02:50:43.530
<v Speaker 2>And a sleeping at altitude is the big one.</v>

6480
02:50:43.650 --> 02:50:47.850
<v Speaker 2>They actually say that you should like go up to big bear to sleep and come down</v>

6481
02:50:47.851 --> 02:50:50.040
<v Speaker 2>to like c level to train.</v>

6482
02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:51.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what they say.</v>

6483
02:50:51.450 --> 02:50:52.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

6484
02:50:52.021 --> 02:50:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I see that.</v>

6485
02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Cause that way you could put out more output glowed and yeah,</v>

6486
02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:56.213
<v Speaker 2>more work.</v>

6487
02:50:56.610 --> 02:50:58.560
<v Speaker 2>But you recover because of the,</v>

6488
02:50:58.561 --> 02:50:58.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6489
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:59.730
<v Speaker 2>sleeping and altitude.</v>

6490
02:50:59.790 --> 02:51:00.623
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6491
02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6492
02:51:01.410 --> 02:51:02.430
<v Speaker 2>we're almost out of time.</v>

6493
02:51:02.431 --> 02:51:04.110
<v Speaker 2>But what did you,</v>

6494
02:51:04.111 --> 02:51:04.830
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

6495
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:08.010
<v Speaker 2>what's the biggest thing that you got out of this whole experiment?</v>

6496
02:51:08.220 --> 02:51:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Other than a great book,</v>

6497

02:51:12.811 --> 02:51:14.280
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I wanted to get you in here.</v>

6500
02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that you are incredibly honest in this,</v>

6501
02:51:17.221 --> 02:51:20.910
<v Speaker 2>about your fears and though the experience and very eloquent.</v>

6502

6509
02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:29.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6510
02:51:29.371 --> 02:51:29.851
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

6511
02:51:29.851 --> 02:51:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6512
02:51:30.130 --> 02:51:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6513
02:51:30.690 --> 02:51:31.680
<v Speaker 2>when I was writing it,</v>

6514
02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:33.120
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking to myself,</v>

6515
02:51:33.570 --> 02:51:34.050

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6518
02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan doesn't like this book.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't read.</v>

6521
02:51:41.770 --> 02:51:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Kindles are so much better to manage.</v>

6522
02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6523

6525
02:51:47.690 --> 02:51:48.690
<v Speaker 2>making your own it.</v>

6526
02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:50.313

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6533
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.823
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

6534
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6535
02:51:59.551 --> 02:52:00.240
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

6536
02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I had been through a sort of lifetime of a,</v>

6537
02:52:03.960 --> 02:52:04.441
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

6538
02:52:04.441 --> 02:52:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like I was a late bloomer.</v>

6539
02:52:06.251 --> 02:52:07.084
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid,</v>

6540
02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:07.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6541
02:52:07.870 --> 02:52:08.770
<v Speaker 2>real small,</v>

6542
02:52:08.810 --> 02:52:10.240
<v Speaker 2>always sort of the runt of my,</v>

6543
02:52:10.241 --> 02:52:10.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6544
02:52:10.780 --> 02:52:13.230
<v Speaker 2>in school came to me in my ailments,</v>

6545
02:52:13.231 --> 02:52:14.560
<v Speaker 2>sort of an average size guy now,</v>

6546
02:52:14.561 --> 02:52:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but I came to my growth really late.</v>

6547
02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And so I sort of have a basic,</v>

6548
02:52:18.041 --> 02:52:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6549
02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.530
<v Speaker 2>school boy's story about getting pushed around and bullied and,</v>

6550
02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:22.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

6551
02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:24.370
<v Speaker 2>and there's no heroism in that story.</v>

6552
02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:25.151
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6553
02:52:25.151 --> 02:52:26.070
<v Speaker 2>and I always backed down.</v>

6554
02:52:26.071 --> 02:52:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I always ran for it.</v>

6555
02:52:27.041 --> 02:52:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I always found some way out of it.</v>

6556
02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:31.120
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't because I was a pacifist,</v>

6557
02:52:31.630 --> 02:52:34.810
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like it had some noble high minded reasons for avoiding the violence.</v>

6558
02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:37.360
<v Speaker 2>It was that I was scared and I knew I was gonna get my ass kicked.</v>

6559
02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:39.970
<v Speaker 2>But I've always kind of felt like that's no excuse for not for fighting.</v>

6560
02:52:40.530 --> 02:52:41.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6561
02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:42.033
<v Speaker 2>that there's a,</v>

6562
02:52:42.570 --> 02:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>you should stand up to the bullet.</v>

6563
02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6564
02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt that way and even though I never did it so,</v>

6565
02:52:46.690 --> 02:52:47.110
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

6566
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:50.710
<v Speaker 2>so part of what I wanted to do was I wanted to go into that cage and I wanted to</v>

6567
02:52:50.711 --> 02:52:55.210
<v Speaker 2>sort of stand up to guys who were stronger than me and more skilled than me and</v>

6568
02:52:55.211 --> 02:52:58.390
<v Speaker 2>sort of taking those beatings that I felt like I should have taken 20 years ago.</v>

6569
02:52:58.450 --> 02:52:59.283
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6570
02:52:59.410 --> 02:52:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6571
02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:01.360
<v Speaker 2>and so as deep well,</v>

6572
02:53:01.361 --> 02:53:01.761
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6573
02:53:01.761 --> 02:53:02.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6574
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:02.950
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

6575
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever had experiences like that as a,</v>

6576
02:53:04.721 --> 02:53:05.554
<v Speaker 2>as a boy.</v>

6577
02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6578
02:53:06.620 --> 02:53:07.453
<v Speaker 2>where are you,</v>

6579
02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:10.870
<v Speaker 2>where you behaved in a fashion that you define as cowardly?</v>

6580
02:53:10.900 --> 02:53:11.201
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6581
02:53:11.201 --> 02:53:11.830
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

6582
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:13.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing to me.</v>

6583
02:53:13.301 --> 02:53:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm 42 years old now.</v>

6584
02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6585
02:53:15.580 --> 02:53:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of accomplishments in my life.</v>

6586
02:53:17.171 --> 02:53:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I have a beautiful wife,</v>

6587
02:53:18.161 --> 02:53:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I have little children who are wonderful.</v>

6588
02:53:20.430 --> 02:53:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6589
02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:25.860
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to me how much psychological weight that still carries from me that</v>

6590
02:53:25.871 --> 02:53:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I could still make myself blush,</v>

6591
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:28.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6592
02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:29.260
<v Speaker 2>thinking back to those moments.</v>

6593
02:53:29.261 --> 02:53:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And so part of it was a redemption story from me about whether I could,</v>

6594
02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:35.230
<v Speaker 2>whether I could do something to redeem myself,</v>

6595
02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:39.550
<v Speaker 2>at least in my own eyes for those times when I'd flinched a as a kid.</v>

6596
02:53:39.610 --> 02:53:40.271
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

6597
02:53:40.271 --> 02:53:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

6598
02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:42.010
<v Speaker 2>I love that you did that.</v>

6599
02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't love that you still blushing over it.</v>

6600
02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.040
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

6601
02:53:45.090 --> 02:53:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So stupid.</v>

6602
02:53:45.820 --> 02:53:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

6603
02:53:46.570 --> 02:53:48.100
<v Speaker 2>But it just means you've got work to do.</v>

6604
02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:48.961
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

6605
02:53:48.961 --> 02:53:49.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6606
02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:51.610
<v Speaker 2>just kind of worked before you realize you're not that guy anymore.</v>

6607
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:52.271
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6608
02:53:52.271 --> 02:53:53.020
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

6609
02:53:53.020 --> 02:53:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6610
02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I sort of became what I was terrified of.</v>

6611
02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:58.030
<v Speaker 2>That's to avoid,</v>

6612
02:53:58.300 --> 02:53:58.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6613
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:59.620
<v Speaker 2>being bullied.</v>

6614
02:53:59.770 --> 02:54:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I just became someone who was,</v>

6615
02:54:00.970 --> 02:54:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I never got in fights like high school on.</v>

6616
02:54:03.191 --> 02:54:04.024
<v Speaker 2>I never got in fights,</v>

6617
02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:09.360
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't get in fights by becoming far stronger than I ever was before.</v>

6618
02:54:10.030 --> 02:54:13.090
<v Speaker 2>But I still would think back to like guys that I was scared of when I was in</v>

6619
02:54:13.091 --> 02:54:13.490
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>

6620
02:54:13.490 --> 02:54:13.661
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

6621
02:54:13.661 --> 02:54:14.020
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

6622
02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:14.531
<v Speaker 2>But it never,</v>

6623
02:54:14.531 --> 02:54:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I never feel like I want to go back now and look and kicked her ass.</v>

6624
02:54:17.291 --> 02:54:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Like that was surprising to me that I never wanted to do that.</v>

6625
02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6626
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And I never wanted to go back.</v>

6627
02:54:22.030 --> 02:54:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

6628
02:54:22.330 --> 02:54:22.930
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

6629
02:54:22.930 --> 02:54:24.190
<v Speaker 2>you remember when you fucked with me.</v>

6630
02:54:24.370 --> 02:54:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

6631
02:54:25.170 --> 02:54:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to do that.</v>

6632
02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

6633
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:27.371
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

6634
02:54:27.371 --> 02:54:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but I also never carried that burden around.</v>

6635
02:54:30.470 --> 02:54:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6636
02:54:31.110 --> 02:54:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6637
02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:32.231
<v Speaker 2>One time when I was,</v>

6638
02:54:32.231 --> 02:54:33.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6639
02:54:33.010 --> 02:54:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about like 19 or 20 when I was already a black belt and I was</v>

6640
02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>working out at my gym where I used to teach and in Boston and I was just doing</v>

6641
02:54:43.181 --> 02:54:44.440
<v Speaker 2>these heavy rounds on the bag,</v>

6642
02:54:44.441 --> 02:54:45.430
<v Speaker 2>preparing for this tournament.</v>

6643
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I had looked up and this guy was watching that used to bully me in junior high</v>

6644
02:54:50.171 --> 02:54:50.940
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

6645
02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:51.420
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

6646
02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:52.510
<v Speaker 2>any from my high school from June,</v>

6647
02:54:52.511 --> 02:54:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like really rough junior high school in Jamaica plain,</v>

6648
02:54:55.691 --> 02:54:56.280
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

6649
02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:57.430
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of gentrified now,</v>

6650
02:54:57.431 --> 02:55:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but at the time was like a really sketchy area of Massachusetts and I looked up</v>

6651
02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:02.260
<v Speaker 2>and I felt bad for the guy.</v>

6652
02:55:02.290 --> 02:55:03.490
<v Speaker 2>It was really like,</v>

6653
02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:04.610
<v Speaker 2>instead of being angry at him,</v>

6654
02:55:04.611 --> 02:55:05.570
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad for him.</v>

6655
02:55:05.770 --> 02:55:06.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6656
02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:06.411
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

6657
02:55:06.411 --> 02:55:07.244
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6658
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:10.610
<v Speaker 2>all those guys from high school were just kids too.</v>

6659
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:11.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6660
02:55:11.271 --> 02:55:12.051
<v Speaker 2>they were fuck ups too.</v>

6661
02:55:12.051 --> 02:55:13.130
<v Speaker 2>They had their own insecurities.</v>

6662
02:55:13.131 --> 02:55:14.090
<v Speaker 2>They had their own problems.</v>

6663
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.931
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

6664
02:55:14.931 --> 02:55:16.250
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid to be hung up on it.</v>

6665
02:55:16.530 --> 02:55:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6666
02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:18.380
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not very hung up on it.</v>

6667
02:55:18.381 --> 02:55:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any fantasies of going back and beating those guys up.</v>

6668
02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:23.000
<v Speaker 2>But I do hope they'll read the book and they'll think,</v>

6669
02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:23.571
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

6670
02:55:23.571 --> 02:55:24.470
<v Speaker 2>he was a character for the boy,</v>

6671
02:55:24.471 --> 02:55:24.711
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

6672
02:55:24.711 --> 02:55:27.590
<v Speaker 2>but he grew into a brave man professor in the cage.</v>

6673
02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:28.880
<v Speaker 2>You could buy it right now.</v>

6674
02:55:28.881 --> 02:55:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's available on Amazon.</v>

6675
02:55:29.991 --> 02:55:30.141
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6676
02:55:30.141 --> 02:55:30.974
<v Speaker 2>I can get a candle.</v>

6677
02:55:31.470 --> 02:55:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6678
02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:32.360
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

6679
02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

6680
02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:33.561
<v Speaker 2>Thank you John.</v>

6681
02:55:33.561 --> 02:55:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Really appreciate it.</v>

6682
02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:34.981
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

6683
02:55:34.981 --> 02:55:35.541
<v Speaker 2>Let's just come on.</v>

6684
02:55:35.541 --> 02:55:36.201
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it,</v>

6685
02:55:36.201 --> 02:55:36.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6686
02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

6687
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:37.520
<v Speaker 2>go buy it.</v>

6688
02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:38.001
<v Speaker 2>Go read it.</v>

6689
02:55:38.001 --> 02:55:38.834
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

6690
02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:40.280
<v Speaker 2>the professor in the cage.</v>

6691
02:55:40.281 --> 02:55:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll be reading it.</v>

6692
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll be talking about it on a future podcast,</v>

6693
02:55:42.561 --> 02:55:43.394
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
