00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much better.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sorry for everything being retarded.</v>

27
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking coffee that came out of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal's ass.</v>

28
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those ones where they </v>

29
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600
<v Speaker 2>filter it through something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called a Kopi Luwak.</v>

30
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 2>That's the name of the coffee and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

31
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:34.111
<v Speaker 2>an animal called a palm civet and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal eats these coffee beans,</v>

32
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 2>eats the bean itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 2>like what it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little fruit.</v>

34
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Shits it out and then they take them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean them.</v>

35
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess hopefully they cleaned them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they make coffee out of it and it's</v>

36
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 2>smoother coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

37
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>like a different sort of a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>flavor to it because they went through </v>

38
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.471
<v Speaker 2>this animal's digestive tract now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if the animal ate a lot of berries </v>

39
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:02.071
<v Speaker 2>and stuff as it have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hints of other different things in </v>

40
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:02.071
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just tastes like coffee.</v>

42
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really kind of gross when you think</v>

43
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was curious.</v>

44
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 2>I had it once before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember tate nine.</v>

45
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 2>We're in Florida and they had it at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and I,</v>

46
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I'd heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we tried it out.</v>

47
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the stomach acids or whatever </v>

48
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.541
<v Speaker 2>it is inside the civets body changes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual chemical structure of the coffee </v>

49
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and it just makes it much smoother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

50
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really.</v>

51
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>It's the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot more expensive.</v>

52
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super expensive.</v>

53
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 2>It's way more expensive than regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>

54
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way more than.</v>

55
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I remember the restaurant was like $90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something stupid like that.</v>

56
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animal.</v>

57
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.620
<v Speaker 2>But how's it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it sounding for everyone?</v>

58
00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 2>What's the people saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

59
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it sounded good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're golden with this thing.</v>

60
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit is so much louder.</v>

61
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 2>it's way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

63
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way better.</v>

64
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

65
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.090
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsored by fleshlight.</v>

66
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talk that it's sponsored</v>

67
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 4>by poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sponsored by a rubber vagina.</v>

68
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever fuck the asshole and.</v>

69
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

70
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.180
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's necessarily.</v>

71
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just tighter.</v>

72
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 4>It might feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be fleshlight tight </v>

73
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

74
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And think you need the butthole one </v>

75
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 4>unless you're just a freak and your wife</v>
<v Speaker 4>will let you have the butthole.</v>

76
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 4>You can have a rubber butthole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

77
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.240
<v Speaker 4>she should be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get your butthole fantasies out of </v>

78
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.240
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you know about the bottom?</v>

79
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it unscrews and it's like a suction</v>

80
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 4>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know the first time I fucked </v>

81
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.211
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like this really suction like </v>

82
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 4>crazy blow job and it was just too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too intense.</v>

83
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't take it because Brian's got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant hog is hitting the back.</v>

84
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Brian's got a fucking oatmeal quaker </v>
<v Speaker 4>oats box.</v>

85
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 4>That's his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I unscrewed it and I guess that adds air</v>

86
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 4>to it and makes it a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you get the fuck a slut.</v>

87
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's either a girl or a slut or a big</v>

88
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 4>giant slot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

89
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was awesome.</v>

90
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.620
<v Speaker 4>I fucking love it was crazy though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that at first I started out putting a</v>

91
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:03.151
<v Speaker 4>bunch of juice in it and it was a juice </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever that oil is the loop.</v>

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you fucking oranges and shit.</v>

93
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.690

<v Speaker 4>Just a teeny bit around the lips of it.</v>

00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Then I had to like get myself hard again</v>
<v Speaker 4>by looking at some porn and then I went </v>

233
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 4>over and the juice was not warm anymore </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was just like,</v>

234
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.050
<v Speaker 4>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

235
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 4>I've reached a point in my life where if</v>
<v Speaker 4>my dick is not hard,</v>

236
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna even try to get it hard to</v>
<v Speaker 4>jerk off.</v>

237
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I do not set aside time to jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like sit down and my Dick's not </v>

238
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 4>hard to go jerk off and start rubbing </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

239
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't do it.</v>

240
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 4>Now you've never done that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

241
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I have in the past for sure dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had days where I jerked off like </v>

242
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.100
<v Speaker 4>four and five times a day where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

243
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know why you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

244
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't even feel good anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why do I keep doing this?</v>

245
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 4>You're doing it just because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed,</v>

246
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because you got to a wacky bug,</v>

247
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you just want to keep jerking off.</v>

248
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.230
<v Speaker 4>It relaxes me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

249
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you say,</v>

250
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about how you take a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and then you're like,</v>

251
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:21.100
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I had this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>

252
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 4>That's how I feel like the sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's controlling me.</v>

253
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 4>Know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But not when you do it five times for </v>

254
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 4>one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

255
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.871
<v Speaker 4>One day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even two shots that they might give you </v>

256
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:32.871
<v Speaker 4>a feeling crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

257
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:32.871
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

258
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:36.971
<v Speaker 4>you just got a text message from your ex</v>
<v Speaker 4>wife and she's having a hard time with </v>

259
00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:37.510
<v Speaker 4>her husband and I know you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

260
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 4>fuck this dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't hate her and she took all</v>

261
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 4>my money and just beat one off real </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>

262
00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might get a second one out of it.</v>

263
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 4>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

264
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.440
<v Speaker 4>But other than that one is one a days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you need when you start jerking off </v>

265
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 4>five times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just a fucking Weirdo.</v>

266
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

267
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I used to get blisters on my dick from </v>
<v Speaker 4>jerking off too,</v>

268
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 4>and I really would</v>

269
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 6>just hold it another way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would figure out another way.</v>

270
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.520
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on two separate occasions in my life I </v>

271
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 6>jerked off so much that I developed like</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little sore spot on my,</v>

272
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 6>so there's no way you could be enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

273
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 6>Like why you jerking off that much </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you fucking crazy.</v>

274
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.660
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you just get it in your head </v>

275
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 6>that you have to check off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I used to fuck pillows,</v>

276
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 6>what was so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 6>His accent ever used my hand.</v>

277
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 6>I would fuck pillows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The worst is watching my mom.</v>

278
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:28.471
<v Speaker 6>Like you draw so much when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about just go in the laundry </v>

279
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 6>room and she's like taking off pillows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sheets that we're sticking to it and you</v>

280
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 6>just look at my pillow and it looked </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

281
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking has for sure.</v>

282
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 6>Touched your loads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

283
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 6>How does that feel?</v>

284
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just can't believe.</v>

285
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 6>How weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your mom has touched your,</v>

286
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.430
<v Speaker 6>your semen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

287
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well she made it.</v>

288
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It all came from her,</v>

289
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She cooked it up inside of her.</v>

290
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't for her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't be alive.</v>

291
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't have any sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

292
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 6>And I just got a three d TV,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those new.</v>

293
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

294
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:00.410
<v Speaker 6>You were telling me about this and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>watched porn on this.</v>

295
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 6>How does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So explain to me,</v>

296
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.170
<v Speaker 6>this is what company makes this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just a Samsung TV.</v>

297
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 6>It's because I saw Sony,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Sony said it's not even out yet.</v>

298
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 6>Tony's on out until the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was very impressive though,</v>

299
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

300
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.250
<v Speaker 6>That Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What it does is it right.</v>

301
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.080
<v Speaker 6>I got a three d TV in a Red Blue Ray </v>
<v Speaker 6>player and it converts first.</v>

302
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 6>You could watch anything on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any show,</v>

303
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 6>any TV and it will convert it into three</v>
<v Speaker 6>d if you want.</v>

304
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.100
<v Speaker 6>How the fuck does it do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has like a smart technology where it </v>

305
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 6>detects what a background is and what </v>
<v Speaker 6>the main character is in.</v>

306
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.340
<v Speaker 6>Tries to layer it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's a really good job.</v>

307
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 6>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was so impressed.</v>

308
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was gonna be like bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was like I watched bill and Ted's</v>

309
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 6>excellent adventure and it looked like </v>
<v Speaker 6>it was made for three days.</v>

310
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

311
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you wear goggles A.</v>

312
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were these little glasses and what </v>

313
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 6>are they gonna fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

314
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 6>supposedly they were already invented </v>
<v Speaker 6>the technology to do it and when it </v>

315
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 6>does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like this great that goes over your</v>

316
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:56.341
<v Speaker 6>tv and it detects where you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the room and it kind of like splits </v>

317
00:13:56.861 --> 00:14:01.861
<v Speaker 6>the images up for you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like from left and right eye and it </v>

318
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 6>makes it three d,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's too expensive right now.</v>

319
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.140
<v Speaker 6>They said that in the next five to eight</v>
<v Speaker 6>years you'll start seeing it coming out </v>

320
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 6>in it and then it will be integrated </v>
<v Speaker 6>into television and be a part of it.</v>

321
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.430
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what's weird about it is that you </v>

322
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 6>using the three d,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you immediately get it.</v>

323
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.480
<v Speaker 6>Like I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're going to have a TV that's </v>

324
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 6>going to be three dimensional soon where</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to look like you're a window,</v>

325
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to be able to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

326
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:23.670
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

327
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:29.010
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you start really getting it now </v>

328
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 6>just tvs themselves are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're just so used to it.</v>

329
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.520
<v Speaker 6>The I just the idea of capturing image,</v>
<v Speaker 6>capturing any image and I mean you're </v>

330
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:41.731
<v Speaker 6>literally taking a snapshot of what's in</v>
<v Speaker 6>front of you and somehow or another you </v>

331
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 6>can send that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can put it in you and you don't even</v>

332
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 6>have to connect it to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It goes from your phone and it can go to</v>

333
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 6>the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll put it on flicker,</v>

334
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.150
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And someone in Nicaragua</v>

335
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.160
<v Speaker 2>can look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention that TVS are like this </v>

336
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:57.160
<v Speaker 2>skinny by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

337
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And so pretty soon you're just going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a look at an IPAD 3d.</v>

338
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>How nuts is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things will fucking crystal clear.</v>

339
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Those really awesome image and it's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>little skinny ass thing,</v>

340
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:08.380
<v Speaker 2>like a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

341
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like a couple pieces of cardboard </v>
<v Speaker 2>stack together,</v>

342
00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking nuts,</v>

345
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 2>think about how long ago was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

346
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 2>you have like this stupid looking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounded circles,</v>

347
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 2>rounded edges on the corner and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>big as fuck.</v>

348
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 2>And you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had to help you move it.</v>

349
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you have those new routines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember what my grandmother used to</v>

350
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where it used to be a record player</v>

351
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 2>on the top and then the speakers on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>side have been there.</v>

352
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.420
<v Speaker 2>It the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

353
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.860
<v Speaker 2>and it was black and white and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny.</v>

354
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 2>It was like fucking smaller than your </v>
<v Speaker 2>laptop.</v>

355
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a piece of furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

356
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It was a coffee table that was super </v>
<v Speaker 2>long and that was just a lifetime ago.</v>

357
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what my parents grew up with.</v>

358
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 2>My parents grew up with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Shit's bananas.</v>

359
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.320
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fucking insane where </v>

360
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 2>technology's headed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just as insane just thinking </v>

361
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 2>about where it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

362
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.660
<v Speaker 2>if you ever wanted evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>

363
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 2>it's evolution seems to be a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything follows.</v>

364
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to like get angry whether or</v>

365
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 2>not evolution exists and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution is real.</v>

366
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 2>And very few people even truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the argument.</v>

367
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

368
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>very complex argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the argument really isn't,</v>

369
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 2>is there a god?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The argument is everything seems to </v>

370
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 2>evolve.</v>

371
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Every single thing seems to change and </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are the clearest example </v>

372
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.121
<v Speaker 2>that just based on our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at just the shit that we </v>

373
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 2>have now in comparison to the things we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a few years ago and the movies,</v>

374
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.120
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch movies and listen to songs from </v>

375
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 2>like the forties and the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you listen to some new shit even if</v>

376
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't like most new shit or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's stupid or you think it's that</v>

377
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 2>the I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you on all that,</v>

378
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:57.221
<v Speaker 2>but just the technical level that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're able to like the kind of music </v>

379
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 2>they're able to make now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:16:58.311 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

381
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you might not be into pink,</v>

382
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.830
<v Speaker 2>listen to a Goddamn pink song and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to go back in time and listen to </v>

383
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 2>some Jefferson airplane and shit and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

384
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they recorded it.</v>

385
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Even if you love that song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they did a terrible job of </v>

386
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 2>like putting it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The evolution of music,</v>

387
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 2>the evolution of television shows like </v>
<v Speaker 2>try watching father knows best.</v>

388
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Try watching any of those fucking stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies from the fifties.</v>

389
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Those goddamn things are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrible.</v>

390
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like everybody falls in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

391
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 2>The bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super obvious.</v>

392
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.670
<v Speaker 2>There's like everything happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so corny and phony and now you </v>

393
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

394
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.090
<v Speaker 2>it's very clear that things are moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain direction,</v>

395
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.240
<v Speaker 2>but everything is not everything though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you go to a gas station and </v>

396
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you prepay for like 20 bucks in that </v>

397
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.270
<v Speaker 2>last dollar takes down.</v>

398
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Why does it do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they want to make sure it </v>

399
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.531
<v Speaker 4>doesn't go over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think they need technology to fix </v>

400
00:17:57.531 --> 00:17:57.531
<v Speaker 4>that because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

401
00:17:57.531 --> 00:17:58.330
<v Speaker 4>because when you do it yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just turn it off like that and</v>

402
00:17:58.331 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 4>then it's like three cents spam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

403
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.740
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you to go over because </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go over just a little bit and </v>

404
00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 4>everybody goes over just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you add that little bit altogether,</v>

405
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:11.001
<v Speaker 4>it's probably millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there should be a technology where </v>

406
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:13.371
<v Speaker 4>it just turns it off at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well really the problem is the real </v>

407
00:18:13.371 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 4>technology issue is that this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel issue,</v>

408
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 4>the real technology is the gasoline </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

409
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 4>We need gasoline to make every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing on this earth and we need gasoline</v>

410
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:22.370
<v Speaker 4>to move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

411
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 4>that's the real technological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the hurdle.</v>

412
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.070
<v Speaker 4>The hurdle isn't your last dollar when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're prepaying for gas.</v>

413
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.430
<v Speaker 4>The hurdle horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real hurdle is the fucking oil,</v>

414
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's frightened shit man.</v>

415
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Whether there things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what my point was there is things that </v>

416
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:39.980
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm amazed that,</v>

417
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:39.980
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

418
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 4>such things are so different from 20 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

419
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Other things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like,</v>

420
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 4>come on gas pumps a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

421
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 4>I hear you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think overall,</v>

422
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:53.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's important for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no innovation as far as like the</v>

423
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:58.371
<v Speaker 4>fuel does that eventually they're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to come up with something new and </v>

424
00:18:58.371 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 4>then when that happens then then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'll,</v>

425
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 4>we'll reach some new point where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

426
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to abandon a gasoline entirely,</v>

427
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 4>but they're going to have to make some </v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic discoveries.</v>

428
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 4>But that's so possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

429
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

430
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.470
<v Speaker 4>people don't even think about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible it is.</v>

431
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:15.471
<v Speaker 4>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could come up with some new way to </v>

432
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:15.740
<v Speaker 4>fucking make hydrogen tomorrow and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would change everything you know,</v>

433
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.780
<v Speaker 4>or some other new type of new way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>making batteries that makes batteries </v>

434
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 4>last longer.</v>

435
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 4>They could figure out some weird shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

436
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:24.960
<v Speaker 4>And then instantly everything changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

437
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:29.961
<v Speaker 4>Battery technology is slow as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Mac just released a new refresh </v>

438
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:34.341
<v Speaker 4>of their Mac book this week and it added</v>
<v Speaker 4>two or three more hours to the last </v>

439
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.510
<v Speaker 4>model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

440
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big job but usually to do that,</v>

441
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 4>but making the batteries larger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>making it so you can't pull them out.</v>

442
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they didn't want this one.</v>

443
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the same size.</v>

444
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.150
<v Speaker 4>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't change anything.</v>

445
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new Mac books can get 10 hours </v>

446
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:53.180
<v Speaker 4>supposedly nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 hours.</v>

447
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 4>I have done this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this 17 inch Mac book pro,</v>

448
00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this thing doesn't get nearly as </v>

449
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:00.660
<v Speaker 4>much as they said if you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>using it.</v>

450
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.090
<v Speaker 4>I got this one which was last model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

451
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.540
<v Speaker 4>and this gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to get five hours.</v>

452
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.550
<v Speaker 4>I get two hours and this is a brand new </v>
<v Speaker 4>battery.</v>

453
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's like you have to like turn the</v>

454
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:14.400
<v Speaker 4>volume on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brightness on a screen way down,</v>

455
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that saves a lot of it.</v>

456
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 4>You can't be cranking volume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be watching movies if you used</v>

457
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eats it up if you have a cellular car to</v>

458
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.580
<v Speaker 4>eat it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet the ipad seems like you can do </v>

459
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:28.580
<v Speaker 4>all that and not even take a dent to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

460
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the battery.</v>

461
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.670
<v Speaker 4>What's up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that battery's crazy dude.</v>

462
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 4>I use that battery for a whole weekend </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's like 50 percent.</v>

463
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:40.161
<v Speaker 4>I know they should just get like three </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those batteries and then when I'm in </v>

464
00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:43.371
<v Speaker 4>a hotel dude I sit with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get on the net and I don't do it </v>

465
00:20:43.371 --> 00:20:43.371
<v Speaker 4>for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

466
00:20:43.371 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll read,</v>

467
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I'll even write some shit on there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

468
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Like little notes and then I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 96 percent</v>

469
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 2>battery liking that ipad by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the future son.</v>

470
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 2>The future is some new fucked up thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even easy to transport around.</v>

471
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:02.071
<v Speaker 2>The Nat [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>That right now is the portable </v>

472
00:21:02.071 --> 00:21:02.071
<v Speaker 2>typewriter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The future.</v>

473
00:21:02.071 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 2>You can totally know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

474
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 2>It's God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss typewriters.</v>

475
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Did you type?</v>

476
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.600
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had to do it for school and you know,</v>

477
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.820
<v Speaker 6>you make a mistake and you have to like </v>
<v Speaker 6>take that white marker thing,</v>

478
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and go over it.</v>

479
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.340
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking pain in the ass it must </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been to write a book back.</v>

480
00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to actually click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

481
00:21:18.741 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

482
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.150
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

483
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.420
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

484
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.780
<v Speaker 6>That TV though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has this,</v>

485
00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.700
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that new Three d tv I got has this thing</v>

486
00:21:23.701 --> 00:21:28.701
<v Speaker 6>called the 240 megahertz mode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's auto motion plus mode and it is the</v>

487
00:21:29.071 --> 00:21:31.020
<v Speaker 6>most fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What it does is it,</v>

488
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 6>it's so fast that it actually makes up </v>
<v Speaker 6>frames in between frames and what the </v>

489
00:21:36.661 --> 00:21:41.661
<v Speaker 6>outcome is is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes any show or any movie look </v>

490
00:21:41.661 --> 00:21:43.440
<v Speaker 6>completely fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you watch,</v>

491
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.610
<v Speaker 6>if you take titanic and if you sit there</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a movie camera and film titanic,</v>

492
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.800
<v Speaker 6>it looks like a movie because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie camera.</v>

493
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.130
<v Speaker 6>You'd take that same scene and record it</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a video camera.</v>

494
00:21:53.131 --> 00:21:55.050
<v Speaker 6>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would look fake and like kind of like</v>

495
00:21:55.051 --> 00:22:00.051
<v Speaker 6>cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what this does though to </v>

496
00:22:00.051 --> 00:22:02.901
<v Speaker 6>every show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you sit there and watched lost or </v>

497
00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:03.210
<v Speaker 6>anything you get pissed off because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>looks like a soap opera.</v>

498
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that kind of weird that video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that don't use video for </v>

499
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.680
<v Speaker 2>things and one of the reasons is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes stuff look fake or make stuff.</v>

500
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look as cool,</v>

501
00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:13.830
<v Speaker 2>but what it means is it doesn't look as </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

502
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

503
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:17.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not as clear an image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fog,</v>

504
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not as foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also that you can focus like in </v>

505
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.280
<v Speaker 2>film you can focus on the guys in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreground,</v>

506
00:22:23.281 --> 00:22:25.280
<v Speaker 2>whereas video kind of just captures </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

507
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.100
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what this,</v>

508
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 6>I guess this TV does is it takes each </v>
<v Speaker 6>frame and makes everything in focus.</v>

509
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 6>So it makes everything seem really </v>
<v Speaker 6>phony.</v>

510
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 6>Like like if you watch loss,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks like a soap opera from Mexico.</v>

511
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It ruins everything.</v>

512
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 6>So I don't know why if Samsung made that</v>
<v Speaker 6>mode,</v>

513
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 6>but now I want to make everything look </v>
<v Speaker 6>fake.</v>

514
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.700
<v Speaker 6>That sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

515
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:47.110
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's want that though.</v>

516
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:52.410
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like it's what's great is </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it and not telling somebody and </v>

517
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:52.410
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

518
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.230
<v Speaker 6>what's your favorite movie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Godfather.</v>

519
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.280
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's watch it.</v>

520
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This doesn't seem as good as I remember </v>

521
00:22:59.370 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it will make you free.</v>

522
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 6>And he been godfather movies or any </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>

523
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 6>So it's some sort of a software thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

524
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:05.920
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

525
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just takes every frame.</v>

526
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:09.070
<v Speaker 6>Makes it a harder conversion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

527
00:23:09.071 --> 00:23:12.090
<v Speaker 6>It's a hardware into the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the TV is,</v>

528
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.810
<v Speaker 2>is actually making you can take an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and it will add</v>

529
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 6>frames to it and make the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes it look,</v>

530
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.750
<v Speaker 6>it speeds it up to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 6>adds extra frames.</v>

531
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.950
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of like a really fast monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

532
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:30.060
<v Speaker 6>So it doesn't look fast or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it looks crisper and clearer and it </v>

533
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.060
<v Speaker 6>looks great.</v>

534
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much time do you think there is </v>

535
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.850
<v Speaker 2>before they make movies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just completely artificial.</v>

536
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.090
<v Speaker 2>That looked like real movies where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

537
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

538
00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.980
<v Speaker 2>like a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like video game style.</v>

539
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Like what was that one movie they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they did a whole movie.</v>

540
00:23:43.681 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Like that final fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what is</v>

541
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 4>a Scifi movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it looked kind of fake,</v>

542
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of goofy fake now to right now it </v>

543
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:53.620
<v Speaker 4>looks stupid as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

544
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 4>But back then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

545
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:58.691
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they did not really good enough </v>

546
00:23:58.691 --> 00:23:58.691
<v Speaker 4>though to warrant making a whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

547
00:23:58.691 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 4>But how many more years it's going to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>by before they can make like Humphrey </v>

548
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 4>bogart movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like make a fake Humphrey bogart movie,</v>

549
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 4>recreate his voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recreate his intonations is,</v>

550
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's gonna Happen,</v>

551
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

552
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:16.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's only a few years off to be </v>

553
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.411
<v Speaker 4>able to make porn with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be able to make any </v>

554
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:22.960
<v Speaker 4>Sarah Pailin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton are going to have </v>

555
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.451
<v Speaker 4>lesbian porn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to fuck each other and 50 </v>

556
00:24:25.451 --> 00:24:25.451
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna be a video game,</v>

557
00:24:25.451 --> 00:24:28.340
<v Speaker 4>choose your character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama looks so realistic,</v>

558
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:33.341
<v Speaker 4>but totally be unrealistic like it could</v>
<v Speaker 4>look exactly like hillary is just armpit</v>

559
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.090
<v Speaker 4>deep into Sarah Palin's pussy.</v>

560
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can make that splattering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just pussy juice all over the website,</v>

561
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 4>splattering pussy juice all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wall when you could.</v>

562
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be able to recreate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beowulf is another one that someone just</v>

563
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:50.450
<v Speaker 4>said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

564
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 4>it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that movie.</v>

565
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.600
<v Speaker 4>It was all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't look real.</v>

566
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 4>It didn't look real at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was cool.</v>

567
00:24:56.121 --> 00:25:01.121
<v Speaker 4>It was a fun little fantasy movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they should have done the Lord </v>

568
00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:01.121
<v Speaker 4>of the rings that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

569
00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 4>the Lord of the rings like Gollum is </v>
<v Speaker 4>fake,</v>

570
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 4>but everybody else was real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's.</v>

571
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:10.360
<v Speaker 4>There was some fake shit there that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to swallow even though they were </v>

572
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:10.360
<v Speaker 4>awesome movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>

573
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I think it would have been cooler if the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole movie was kind of fantasy.</v>

574
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't need real actors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

575
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 4>plus real actress look to human.</v>

576
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 4>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be fucking weird looking.</v>

577
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

578
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:25.901
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to just be some dude </v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing like furry shoes that look like </v>

579
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:25.901
<v Speaker 4>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet,</v>

580
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:29.911
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just watched that Alice in wonderland </v>

581
00:25:29.911 --> 00:25:31.811
<v Speaker 4>last night and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was actually kind of cool how they </v>

582
00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 4>took real characters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they distorted them.</v>

583
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.970
<v Speaker 4>They've made their head's bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller.</v>

584
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

585
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.520
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the main,</v>

586
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the queen of hearts.</v>

587
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.410
<v Speaker 4>Who was that lady?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that lady's name?</v>

588
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 4>Halina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bottom corner.</v>

589
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 4>She had the big giant fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was pretty trippy.</v>

590
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:50.050
<v Speaker 4>I love that cat to cat was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a movie to only go to see if </v>

591
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:50.050
<v Speaker 4>you're really high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

592
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was okay.</v>

593
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:55.901
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a good is not good now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was interesting because I was </v>

594
00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:57.270
<v Speaker 4>barbecued.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a pot cookie like an hour before I</v>

595
00:25:57.271 --> 00:26:02.271
<v Speaker 4>went to see that and moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I went to the movie I was just </v>

596
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:03.440
<v Speaker 4>was by the time to first frame started </v>

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.470
<v Speaker 4>I was like just completely blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's fascinating that the cat was </v>

598
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 4>really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like as a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>with the day and go back home and play </v>

<v Speaker 4>Sixty percent of the days were gray.</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing stand up and that's what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>found.</v>

691
00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a real gray there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of parts of the country </v>

692
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 2>that are just real gray for like a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the year.</v>

693
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 2>That shit ain't good for you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sucks.</v>

694
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.940
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

695
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:56.590
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of programmed,</v>

696
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:02.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human body needs a certain amount </v>

697
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.010
<v Speaker 2>from its environment and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things we need is sunlight.</v>

698
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>We literally need sunlight for vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need it for vitamin D,</v>

699
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.840
<v Speaker 2>but we also needed for happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about skies that are </v>

700
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.221
<v Speaker 2>gloomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are depressing and it's encoded </v>

701
00:30:14.221 --> 00:30:14.980
<v Speaker 2>into your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your DNA is telling you,</v>

702
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

703
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:18.490
<v Speaker 2>you're living in a place where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be uncomfortable.</v>

704
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.670
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get drenched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get that vitamin D </v>

705
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 2>that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can get past that,</v>

706
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 2>you'll be okay.</v>

707
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 2>If you can go to the sun and get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunny parts,</v>

708
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>then you'll be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can literally literally changes</v>

709
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 2>your state to be indifferent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you know,</v>

710
00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically changes it and if you live in</v>

711
00:30:35.231 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 2>a place where it's just you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that son,</v>

712
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't get enough of that son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

713
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's also different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have different needs to.</v>

714
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I think genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

715
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 2>I bet if you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet living in a place where it's never</v>

716
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 2>sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking terrible.</v>

717
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's terrible for you because like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole dark skin and dark skin,</v>

718
00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be in response to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright sun and you know,</v>

719
00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 2>living in a hot climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

720
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 2>dark skinned like Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

721
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 2>they're dark skinned and that's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be because they have to deal with the</v>

722
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 2>hot sun and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

723
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of a climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go to places like Siberia,</v>

724
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:11.821
<v Speaker 2>people are pretty fucking white just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because no one's ever outside in the </v>

725
00:31:11.821 --> 00:31:11.821
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

726
00:31:11.821 --> 00:31:11.821
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

727
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grow accustomed to it.</v>

728
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:16.240
<v Speaker 2>So maybe if you're a person that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

729
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:21.320
<v Speaker 2>it's got super pale skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be way easier to live in a </v>

730
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 2>place where it doesn't get sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

731
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's like genetic needs.</v>

732
00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:23.840
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

733
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

734
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

735
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew about those lights before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when I lived in Ohio.</v>

736
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Like there's the sunlight lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of those?</v>

737
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll artificial lights.</v>

738
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>The lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

739
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 2>They have alarm clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have that built into them too.</v>

740
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about getting one.</v>

741
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:40.840
<v Speaker 2>That's a trick though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck would that be?</v>

742
00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:45.841
<v Speaker 2>As good as going outside on a sunny day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some days are awesome because everybody </v>

743
00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:46.460
<v Speaker 2>else is happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's tricky.</v>

744
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.770
<v Speaker 2>When I lived in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

745
00:31:47.771 --> 00:31:49.690
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live sunny days,</v>

746
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 2>but now in la you're just so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like sunny days or just what you </v>

747
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 2>get every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

748
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.361
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the opposite today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cloudy and you get fired up when </v>

749
00:31:59.361 --> 00:31:59.361
<v Speaker 2>it's cloudy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

750
00:31:59.361 --> 00:32:03.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get some nice rain </v>

751
00:32:03.181 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>because it literally is sunny here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred and 60 days a year almost.</v>

752
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy.</v>

753
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many days a year?</v>

754
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's maybe three.</v>

755
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.340
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

756
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

757
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Was like a month though that it rains </v>
<v Speaker 2>like every day sometimes.</v>

758
00:32:15.411 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Like every other year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiers.</v>

759
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up.</v>

760
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get used to that.</v>

761
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:22.100
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

762
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:28.390
<v Speaker 2>But it's a terrible for your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know in Australia when I was in </v>

763
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.541
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all these ads for skin cancer </v>

764
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:31.541
<v Speaker 2>because Australia doesn't have a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>ozone layer.</v>

765
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Remember when there was the big hole in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ozone layer?</v>

766
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:37.901
<v Speaker 2>Worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's all over Australia and </v>

767
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:40.421
<v Speaker 2>apparently Australia doesn't give a shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have all these ads everywhere </v>

768
00:32:40.421 --> 00:32:43.451
<v Speaker 2>you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being careful because if you go </v>

769
00:32:43.451 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 2>outside without sunscreen on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get skin cancer.</v>

770
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:49.091
<v Speaker 2>So they have these really graphic skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer ads on the side of buses or </v>

771
00:32:49.091 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 2>stitches and shit and see big pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat cut out of people.</v>

772
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.010
<v Speaker 6>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like or when it gets cigarettes and like</v>

773
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.480
<v Speaker 6>Canada and it shows like some guy with </v>
<v Speaker 6>throat cancer on the back of your box.</v>

774
00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:57.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

775
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Just like rough about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see people smoking in England,</v>

776
00:33:02.131 --> 00:33:05.010
<v Speaker 2>they have big giant warnings in the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their cigarettes.</v>

777
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Speaker 2>But you need that son look at you.</v>

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Smell like you got some your dogs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you said.</v>

807
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Let your dogs smell nice ground at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

808
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Like angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that dog locks on your ass.</v>

809
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Speaker 2>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happened before.</v>

810
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.970
<v Speaker 2>There's dogs that can smell cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

811
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.330
<v Speaker 2>They can take test tubes and lines like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

812
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.360
<v Speaker 2>they did this test with them where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just have this big giant like 20 yard </v>

813
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.400
<v Speaker 2>line and down the line and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different test tube and you know,</v>

814
00:34:32.401 --> 00:34:35.730
<v Speaker 2>at increments and each different tests </v>
<v Speaker 2>who has a different thing in it and then</v>

815
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.400
<v Speaker 2>they'll go right to the ones with cancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they bark.</v>

816
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.840
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

817
00:34:39.841 --> 00:34:41.310
<v Speaker 2>They can smell fucking cancer.</v>

818
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:47.130
<v Speaker 6>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love that whole thing where there's </v>

819
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.130
<v Speaker 6>stuff we don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Things like dogs and like that.</v>

820
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.930
<v Speaker 6>Just that they know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like earthquakes.</v>

821
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Just the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

822
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:51.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

823
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.530
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know tsunamis are coming.</v>

824
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:58.560
<v Speaker 2>They go run in the Thailand tsunami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that last big one that happened.</v>

825
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Very few animals tied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man Deanna,</v>

826
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.470
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if any.</v>

827
00:35:02.471 --> 00:35:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I think the animals all escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all saw common and got the fuck out</v>

828
00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:06.910
<v Speaker 2>of dodge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like way,</v>

829
00:35:06.911 --> 00:35:09.670
<v Speaker 2>way in advance because they don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

830
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that the earth itself probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>has some sort of a language and if you </v>

831
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:15.760
<v Speaker 2>have a language yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:35:15.761 --> 00:35:18.010
<v Speaker 2>like human beings do and we have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to communicate.</v>

833
00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:21.610
<v Speaker 2>We're so wrapped up and communicating </v>
<v Speaker 2>with ourselves that we don't receive any</v>

834
00:35:21.611 --> 00:35:24.730
<v Speaker 2>communication from animals or plants or </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the world.</v>

835
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about like,</v>

836
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.620
<v Speaker 2>like words like dogs talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did you ever meet a dog and you </v>

837
00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:31.620
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fuck with his dog.</v>

838
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.850
<v Speaker 2>He never meet a dog and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on buddy?</v>

839
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And you're looking at him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at you and you're like,</v>

840
00:35:35.531 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get the fuck from you.</v>

841
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 2>That dog is sending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's somehow or another.</v>

842
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not even his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his demeanor.</v>

843
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 2>He's not growling at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

844
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>but he's just giving you a look and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a message.</v>

845
00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's communicating with you,</v>

846
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:51.710
<v Speaker 2>but you got all sorts of shit inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>

847
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 2>The stock market and your divorce and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking homework.</v>

848
00:35:55.021 --> 00:36:00.021
<v Speaker 2>And this and that and language and </v>
<v Speaker 2>English and I'm learning Spanish and </v>

849
00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 2>you've got all this shit going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>

850
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I bet the earth itself actually has like</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a way of communicating </v>

851
00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:11.001
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with beings and with animals that don't </v>

852
00:36:11.001 --> 00:36:13.851
<v Speaker 2>have languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they can tune into shit that we </v>

853
00:36:13.851 --> 00:36:13.851
<v Speaker 2>can't tune into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

854
00:36:13.851 --> 00:36:15.990
<v Speaker 2>how dogs can smell things and tune into </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

855
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 2>And I mean they have a super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

856
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:19.110
<v Speaker 2>super powered senses.</v>

857
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.690
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can sense that they,</v>

858
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 6>that if they have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

859
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>

860
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just can't communicate.</v>

862
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

863
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 2>but dumb dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.790
<v Speaker 6>it's funny when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

865
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.300
<v Speaker 6>when the doctor is asking me if it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>black and I'm like,</v>

866
00:36:34.301 --> 00:36:35.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like very dark,</v>

867
00:36:35.711 --> 00:36:36.470
<v Speaker 6>dark brown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

868
00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:39.700
<v Speaker 6>well dark brown and black is completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>different and I'm like,</v>

869
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.260
<v Speaker 6>it's not really different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

870
00:36:41.261 --> 00:36:42.580
<v Speaker 6>do you want me to take a photo of it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

871
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.810
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not necessary.</v>

872
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.420
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well are you talking about $10,000</v>

873
00:36:46.421 --> 00:36:47.590
<v Speaker 6>difference?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if I say no,</v>

874
00:36:47.591 --> 00:36:52.591
<v Speaker 6>it's black,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or are you gonna like make me go to the </v>

875
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:53.050
<v Speaker 6>hospital and do all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I just don't get doctors,</v>

876
00:36:53.051 --> 00:36:54.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like,</v>

877
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.070
<v Speaker 2>while he's just probably tired of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

878
00:36:56.071 --> 00:37:01.071
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do everyday deals with people that are </v>

879
00:37:01.071 --> 00:37:01.071
<v Speaker 2>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine what that'd be like?</v>

880
00:37:01.071 --> 00:37:05.270
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a psych major for awhile in </v>

881
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 2>college and I was thinking like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be a psychologist.</v>

882
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:10.560
<v Speaker 2>I give people good advice and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about it and I was like,</v>

883
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be dealing with fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up people every day.</v>

884
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Every day you're on fucked up energy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best you can do with these people is</v>

885
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 2>make them not fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

886
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:24.201
<v Speaker 2>that's the best you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not getting any fucking </v>

887
00:37:24.201 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 2>happiness and joy and excitement and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful feelings all day.</v>

888
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you're just dealing with fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and some people want to do that.</v>

890
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to help you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good on you,</v>

891
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 2>good on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

892
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.690
<v Speaker 2>that would have to be a fuck</v>

893
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 6>drag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also in La,</v>

894
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:38.500
<v Speaker 6>I think it's completely worse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if</v>

895
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.620
<v Speaker 2>so self indulgent out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And plus there's just so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many people and so many people trying</v>

897
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:46.530
<v Speaker 2>to do something completely unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

898
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 2>How many people out here want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>

899
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I live out in the burbs and you run </v>

900
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:53.660
<v Speaker 2>into people and you don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the type.</v>

901
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And then as you get to know them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out,</v>

902
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came out here to be an actor.</v>

903
00:37:57.451 --> 00:37:59.370
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got into plumbing,</v>

904
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

905
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wanting to be an actor.</v>

906
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how'd you get your spot?</v>

907
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.250
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to do that,</v>

908
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:05.760
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get?</v>

909
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.560
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get on that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanting to do that.</v>

910
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 2>And you find out that like literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

911
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:14.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of people that move out </v>

912
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.820
<v Speaker 2>here for even in the back of their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some weird show Biz dream.</v>

913
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like fucking 60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

914
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a completely unrealistic number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about how many people there</v>

915
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:23.430
<v Speaker 2>are out there that actually become </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous from acting,</v>

916
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.640
<v Speaker 2>especially acting man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's fucking who.</v>

917
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Who's to say you're a good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a hell.</v>

918
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 2>You get good at pretending to be someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

919
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:33.210
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's some methods to it and I</v>

920
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 2>guess you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all depends on personality,</v>

921
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 2>what kind of energy you're packing </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of you,</v>

922
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 2>but then somebody has to agree to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in a movie and somebody has to agree</v>

923
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 2>they like you and what are the odds </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to happen?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those people are.</v>

925
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:51.670

<v Speaker 2>and that fucking chips away at them.</v>

926
00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 2>And then the reason why they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be actors in the first place,</v>

927
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:58.891
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost they're fucked up because they </v>

928
00:38:58.891 --> 00:38:58.891
<v Speaker 2>didn't get any attention as a chat.</v>

931
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.341
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the same reason why people </v>

932
00:39:08.341 --> 00:39:09.651
<v Speaker 2>become comedians and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of extreme attention performer </v>

966
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:35.070
<v Speaker 2>When I stand next to that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can not believe that that guy gets to </v>

967
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.490
<v Speaker 2>170 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so much bigger than me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bigger than me.</v>

969
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:45.570

<v Speaker 2>heat dries himself out totally to one </v>

970
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.840
<v Speaker 2>70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets on the scale and then rehydrates </v>

971
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 2>and gets to like 200 pounds by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to fight.</v>

972
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they do it.</v>

973
00:40:55.350 --> 00:41:00.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's dangerous and when dudes are </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

975
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Tiago has never looked bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen some guys look real bad.</v>

976
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:11.251
<v Speaker 2>I was like Travis Luder once didn't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight for the Anderson Silva fight and </v>

977
00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:14.641
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to try and try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he could not cut the weight for </v>

978
00:41:14.641 --> 00:41:17.131
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason and he's walking towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scale and he was shuffling because </v>

979
00:41:17.131 --> 00:41:18.190
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't even pick his feet up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his cheeks were all sunken in.</v>

980
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 2>He looked like he was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's lips were all chapped and broken </v>

981
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like this dude looks like he's in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn concentration camp.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And this one is very controversial </v>

1009
00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.230

<v Speaker 2>to get married or whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She only thought regular marriage.</v>

1014
00:42:55.321 --> 00:43:00.321
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was opposed to opposite marriage or </v>

1015
00:43:00.321 --> 00:43:01.010

<v Speaker 2>to same sex marriage,</v>

1016
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 2>but she supported opposite sex marriage.</v>

1017
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how she described it.</v>

1018
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Like opposite marriage as a train wreck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more important than having them to </v>

<v Speaker 2>some shit that you're not supposed to do</v>

1069
00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 2>if you're Miss USA,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's in violation and you're gonna </v>

1073
00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:41.720
<v Speaker 2>attract undue attention to our cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our cause of the miss who I most like to</v>

<v Speaker 2>The Squirrel didn't do shit to me,</v>

1095
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:53.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like we wanted to see if we </v>

1096
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:53.360
<v Speaker 2>could do it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>

1099
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The things you do,</v>

1101
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so inconsiderate when you're 15,</v>

1102
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I don't think I was 15.</v>

1103
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I was 14 and I never did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1104
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:13.730
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like one thing about eating that </v>

1105
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.351
<v Speaker 2>squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just killed that squirrel with a </v>

1106
00:47:15.351 --> 00:47:15.351
<v Speaker 2>marble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot him in a marble,</v>

1107
00:47:15.351 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what?</v>

1108
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How stupid is that?</v>

1109
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:18.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be,</v>

1110
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:23.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn from those experiences and </v>

1111
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:23.241
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn from that terrible feeling and</v>

1112
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 2>you never do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But God,</v>

1113
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't have to do it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place to learn that.</v>

1114
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are so fucking</v>

1115
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.930
<v Speaker 4>like some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many people do you see?</v>

1116
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:36.931
<v Speaker 4>Just throwing cigarettes out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about that this all the </v>

1117
00:47:36.931 --> 00:47:36.931
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the time.</v>

1118
00:47:36.931 --> 00:47:37.250
<v Speaker 4>That's so inconsiderate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1119
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do it though.</v>

1120
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.340
<v Speaker 4>That really sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did you stop doing it?</v>

1121
00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 4>When he moved to California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1122
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a California thing I think.</v>

1123
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 4>Why did California make you stop doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

1124
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Because in Ohio it was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was normal and in California cops </v>

1125
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:54.590
<v Speaker 4>would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1126
00:47:54.591 --> 00:47:59.591
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cops that you would be smoking a </v>

1127
00:47:59.591 --> 00:47:59.591
<v Speaker 4>cigarette while they're writing you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ticket and just flick it on the ground.</v>

1128
00:47:59.591 --> 00:47:59.740
<v Speaker 4>Do you know who the fuck is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is?</v>

1129
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 4>What is it about smokers that makes them</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that the world is the garbage?</v>

1130
00:48:03.341 --> 00:48:06.230
<v Speaker 4>Because up to recently that was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1131
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 4>but why is that normal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it normal?</v>

1132
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.770

1134
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.000

1136
00:48:17.491 --> 00:48:18.850

<v Speaker 4>ground?</v>

00:48:42.661 --> 00:48:42.661
<v Speaker 4>cigarette filters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when,</v>

1147

<v Speaker 4>how long does it take them?</v>

1148
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 4>How many of them are biodegradable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how long does it take them to dissolve?</v>

1149
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.960
<v Speaker 4>Flicking her cigarette out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The window creates jobs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what my friend's argument was.</v>

1152
00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.810
<v Speaker 4>It was a fucking guy justice for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>living.</v>

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.270
<v Speaker 4>What he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to clean it up,</v>

1154
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 4>is his argument was that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody gets paid to do it,</v>

1155
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 4>so it's like cleaning up at a </v>

00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:50.940
<v Speaker 4>They swapped all these glasses and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>90 percent of the glasses,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1260
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:25.740
<v Speaker 4>who there was not even gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even there's no white guys that,</v>

1261
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

1262
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 2>talk like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black guys,</v>

1263
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 2>why do I have a dead nigger in my house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that scene was so fake and it was</v>

1264
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 2>so like him living out some weird white </v>
<v Speaker 2>boy fantasy where he wants to be able to</v>

1265
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 2>say nigger to a black guy because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a script.</v>

1266
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:39.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.200
<v Speaker 6>It used to be a big Quintin Tarantino </v>
<v Speaker 6>Fan.</v>

1268
00:53:42.201 --> 00:53:43.490
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I see,</v>

1269
00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:45.440
<v Speaker 6>I saw that TMZ video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ever see that?</v>

1270
00:53:45.441 --> 00:53:47.360
<v Speaker 6>Where he attacks like the cameraman?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1271
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.910
<v Speaker 6>and he just came off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1272
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 6>Like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was.</v>

1273
00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them come off really cool and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

1274
00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:58.831
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him come off like a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think these are volatile God </v>

1275
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:00.520
<v Speaker 2>because he's a creative guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably super fucking busy all the time</v>

1276
00:54:00.521 --> 00:54:05.521
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you catch them at the wrong time </v>

1277
00:54:05.521 --> 00:54:05.530
<v Speaker 2>and you're trying to talk shit to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be stupid.</v>

1278
00:54:05.531 --> 00:54:09.280
<v Speaker 2>He's very likely to talk shit back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and come off all Douchey,</v>

1279
00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:11.560
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to think what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation?</v>

1280
00:54:11.561 --> 00:54:14.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not him forcing his penis on </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

1281
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It's someone wanting to videotape him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was wanting to be video,</v>

1282
00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:20.020
<v Speaker 2>someone coming up to a member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was just somebody,</v>

1283
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.060
<v Speaker 2>a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could find that link right now.</v>

1284
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it was somebody going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1285
00:54:23.631 --> 00:54:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of your movies and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got.</v>

1286
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:26.740
<v Speaker 2>And he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1287
00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>

1289
00:54:28.931 --> 00:54:33.931
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe just has a huge aversion to </v>

1290
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:33.931
<v Speaker 2>all that Tmz Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1291
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that just drives them nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1292
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of pulp fiction.</v>

1293
00:54:37.331 --> 00:54:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I love that fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I read all that shit that Roger</v>

1294
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Avery said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Roger Avery who's in jail.</v>

1295
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.640
<v Speaker 2>He claims that there was like a movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1296
00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:50.820
<v Speaker 2>that Quintin Tarantino did when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>star in the movie where he had this </v>

1297
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.360
<v Speaker 2>whole scene about top gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the scene?</v>

1298
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.900
<v Speaker 2>He had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1299
00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:59.100
<v Speaker 2>it was a whole scene in this movie about</v>
<v Speaker 2>top gun being a gay story and this is </v>

1300
00:54:59.261 --> 00:55:00.760
<v Speaker 2>why it's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

1301
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he,</v>

1302
00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:06.821
<v Speaker 2>he goes into this whole rant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well apparently that was like Roger </v>

1303
00:55:06.821 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Avery's rant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger Avery.</v>

1304
00:55:07.381 --> 00:55:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger Avery wrote killing Zoe,</v>

1305
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:12.070
<v Speaker 2>which is an awesome movie if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never seen it,</v>

1306
00:55:12.071 --> 00:55:17.071
<v Speaker 2>really interesting cool crime movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote pulp fiction with Quentin </v>

1307
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would collaborate on things and </v>

1308
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1309
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 2>he would tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>

1310
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.120
<v Speaker 2>tell me these stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I slapped him.</v>

1311
00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe that guy needed to be one of </v>

<v Speaker 2>the audio real quick.</v>

1330
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.690
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you haven't seen it,</v>

1331
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Quintin Tarantino slaps a camera man on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and it's some guy who gets </v>

1332
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.030
<v Speaker 2>douchey with him.</v>

1337
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:07.970
<v Speaker 6>the reporter he fucked with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that guy just came up to him</v>

1338
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:13.250
<v Speaker 2>camera and he wouldn't tell them what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was about and he just sticking a camera </v>

1339
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:14.070
<v Speaker 2>in his face and maybe he felt like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was being violated and he felt like that</v>

1340
00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:15.930
<v Speaker 2>guy was a dickhead.</v>

1346
00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:27.060

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1347
00:57:27.061 --> 00:57:32.061
<v Speaker 2>he could easily be involved in some big </v>
<v Speaker 2>stressful fucking thing with some movie </v>

1348
00:57:32.061 --> 00:57:33.390

<v Speaker 2>Some guys got a camera in his face,</v>

1350
00:57:35.641 --> 00:57:36.450

<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

1357

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just posted on my twitter red band </v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulp fiction was an awesome movie,</v>

1360
00:57:55.261 --> 00:57:56.810
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

1361
00:57:56.811 --> 00:57:59.880
<v Speaker 2>the whole Roger Avery thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unfortunate.</v>

1362
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Roger Avery says that that whole top gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>rent was like his rant and the </v>

1363
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.821
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it in front of Tarantino and </v>

1364
00:58:08.821 --> 00:58:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tina went and put it in a movie with </v>

1365
00:58:10.791 --> 00:58:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Tara Tito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does with his movies.</v>

1366
00:58:11.431 --> 00:58:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of his movies are like old </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that he kinda like redoes right?</v>

1367
00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1368
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 6>Well have you been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about earlier about the </v>

1369
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:22.761
<v Speaker 6>hurt locker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how that guy suing the writer of the </v>

1370
00:58:22.761 --> 00:58:25.851
<v Speaker 6>hurt locker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying that he took a article that he </v>

1371
00:58:25.851 --> 00:58:28.230
<v Speaker 6>did for playboy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess about his time in the bomb squad</v>

1372
00:58:28.231 --> 00:58:31.320
<v Speaker 6>and they re wrote it into the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hurt locker</v>

1373
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's really similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the guy had like blonde hair blue.</v>

1374
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I came from a trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole deal,</v>

1375
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 2>like his story is exactly that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in their defense,</v>

1376
00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 2>like how many guys in the military or </v>
<v Speaker 2>blond hair,</v>

1377
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:46.060
<v Speaker 2>blue eyes come from trailers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a lot,</v>

1378
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:51.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally the fact that he was actually a </v>

1379
00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:51.380
<v Speaker 2>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1380
00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.130
<v Speaker 2>specialists and detonation specialists </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this guy was as well.</v>

1381
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:54.640

<v Speaker 6>and what's crazy,</v>

1383
00:58:56.071 --> 00:59:01.071
<v Speaker 6>even as the creator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those movies are supposedly going to </v>

1384
00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:04.941
<v Speaker 6>sooth thousands of bit torrent users.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People that downloaded the movie </v>

1385
00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:06.990
<v Speaker 6>illegally on the Internet and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to go after all of these users,</v>

1386
00:59:06.991 --> 00:59:10.140
<v Speaker 6>which I thought was very metallic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Metallic.</v>

1387
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's his movie,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1392
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.400

<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an argument,</v>

1395
00:59:23.421 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is an argument,</v>

1396
00:59:24.681 --> 00:59:25.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1397
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1398
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.190
<v Speaker 2>That's an argument as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1399
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a right to be downloading</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's work.</v>

1400
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:35.480
<v Speaker 2>These guys worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did all this time,</v>

1401
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 2>put a pause time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put all this effort,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you watch it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something fucked up about that.</v>

1406
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:51.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1407
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 2>like if you go see a band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1408
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:57.780
<v Speaker 2>like say if you download a band's mp3s </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you got them offline wire assumption</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know that I'm going to become a fan </v>

1412
01:00:09.121 --> 01:00:09.121
<v Speaker 2>of this band because I downloaded their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit for free.</v>

1413
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Is that really going to help you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy with his movie?</v>

1414

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.310
<v Speaker 6>deal in a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Depends if he was how good this movie is</v>

1420
01:00:24.311 --> 01:00:29.311
<v Speaker 6>and how good of a directory is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he was Quintin Tarantino doing pulp </v>

1421
01:00:29.311 --> 01:00:29.311
<v Speaker 6>fiction and I downloaded that,</v>

1425
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see that argument.</v>

1426
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:35.680

<v Speaker 2>just decide to steal his next shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit's coming out.</v>

1428
01:00:39.331 --> 01:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you really do support them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do that?</v>

1429
01:00:42.061 --> 01:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Like if you download something and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>

1430
01:00:43.771 --> 01:00:45.630
<v Speaker 2>do you support the artists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1431
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

1432
01:00:46.321 --> 01:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1433
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen quite as often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is shit though.</v>

1434
01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1435
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:55.510
<v Speaker 2>like you do that with movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you download a movie and you </v>

1436
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.510
<v Speaker 2>really like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you buy?</v>

1437
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1438
01:00:55.921 --> 01:00:56.730
<v Speaker 2>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

1439
01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Beowulf was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I download Beowulf and I liked that </v>

1440
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you have a legal copy and your </v>

1441
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.070
<v Speaker 2>house and then you also have an illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>copy on your computer?</v>

1442
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It should cancel it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's how it works </v>

1443
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're totally right.</v>

1444
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to have a copy as </v>

1445
01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:13.671
<v Speaker 2>long as you're not putting it up on some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sites or something like that.</v>

1446
01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.060
<v Speaker 2>If you have your own copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is wrong with?</v>

1447
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1448
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:20.951
<v Speaker 6>it would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like if you got in trouble and I'm </v>

1449
01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:20.951
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

1450
01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:20.951
<v Speaker 6>you're going to go to court for </v>
<v Speaker 6>$100,000,</v>

1451
01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 6>but you have 24 hours to buy this movie </v>
<v Speaker 6>on DVD.</v>

1452
01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would.</v>

1453
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.410
<v Speaker 2>That's how it was actually a good move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1454
01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Just just sue everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to buy it on Blue Ray in 24</v>

1456
01:01:32.141 --> 01:01:33.580
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky argument,</v>

1457
01:01:33.581 --> 01:01:38.581
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky argument because you know </v>

1458
01:01:38.581 --> 01:01:38.581
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1459
01:01:38.581 --> 01:01:40.510
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in the Internet now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anything can be broken down to ones</v>

1460
01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:41.350
<v Speaker 2>and Zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1461
01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:42.850
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these images,</v>

1462
01:01:42.851 --> 01:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these song files,</v>

1463
01:01:45.311 --> 01:01:50.311
<v Speaker 2>audio files,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all just ones and zeros flying </v>

1464
01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:53.191
<v Speaker 2>through the tubes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can put it up there and anybody </v>

1465
01:01:53.191 --> 01:01:55.570
<v Speaker 2>can pull it down and when you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>convert a movie and you know,</v>

1466
01:01:55.571 --> 01:02:00.571
<v Speaker 2>you do all the time into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into something digital that's </v>

1467
01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:00.571
<v Speaker 2>downloadable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1468
01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:02.310
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you control that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1469
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you have to just hope that you make </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough movie,</v>

1470
01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:10.020
<v Speaker 2>enough money when the movie's out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that enough people get excited about it </v>

1471
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.110
<v Speaker 2>to buy the DVD for other extra features </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that shit.</v>

1472
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.080
<v Speaker 2>But then people take the dvds after </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're released and they put those up.</v>

1473
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:19.200
<v Speaker 6>What I don't get is a friend of ours </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually just got a letter from their </v>

1474
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 6>isp saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1475
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.040
<v Speaker 4>ABC has caught them downloading a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Jew a that ABC has caught them for </v>

1476
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:32.160
<v Speaker 4>downloading a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

1477
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 4>this is just a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's happening right now.</v>

1478
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:39.381
<v Speaker 4>But we just wanted to let you know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ABC sent us this letter and they know </v>

1479
01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:39.570
<v Speaker 4>about you downloading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So chill the fuck out.</v>

1480
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 4>And what was crazy is it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

1481
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 4>it was TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free tv,</v>

1482
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 4>it was like lost and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't even a movie.</v>

1483
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.420
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But was he downloading illegally?</v>

1484
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was downloading them illegally.</v>

1485
01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to do that because they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own sites and there's pay </v>

1486
01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:58.300
<v Speaker 4>services.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1487
01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 4>I just thought it was crazy that they </v>

<v Speaker 4>have and it's coming from this one user </v>

1511
01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:46.250
<v Speaker 4>it let's find out who this isp belonged.</v>

1512
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.720
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to use the torrent system.</v>

1513
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:53.721
<v Speaker 4>So like you get a lot of like young kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>or moms that are like downloading sex </v>

1514
01:03:53.721 --> 01:03:55.290
<v Speaker 4>and the city and they just keep the </v>
<v Speaker 4>torrent going for life.</v>

1515
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do they do?</v>

1516
01:03:55.981 --> 01:04:00.981
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get your Ip from them or they find </v>

1517
01:04:00.981 --> 01:04:00.981
<v Speaker 4>out your isp or your Isp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your Internet service provider.</v>

1518
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.380
<v Speaker 4>The Internet protocol is your specific </v>
<v Speaker 4>number that every,</v>

1519
01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.180
<v Speaker 4>everyone that gets online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know this,</v>

1520
01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:11.181
<v Speaker 4>you have a very specific number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be static or it could </v>

1521
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:11.640
<v Speaker 4>fluctuate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could fluctuate.</v>

1522
01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:13.170
<v Speaker 4>If you have dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every time you do it,</v>

1523
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:14.280
<v Speaker 4>you get a different Ip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1524
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what it is,</v>

1525
01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:20.181
<v Speaker 4>it's these movie places putting out </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own torrents and seeds and </v>

1526
01:04:20.181 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 4>collecting Ip addresses from like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll put their own movies out,</v>

1527
01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:22.700
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1528
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 4>So they put their movie out on purpose </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see if you download it.</v>

1530
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that's how one of their ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it.</v>

1531
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.430
<v Speaker 4>That's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that's like,</v>

1532
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:37.460
<v Speaker 4>that should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see what they're doing is </v>

1533
01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:37.460
<v Speaker 4>entrapment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a lot of it though,</v>

1534
01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 4>is a lot of it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you download,</v>

1535
01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:44.181
<v Speaker 4>like I downloaded an m and m cd once and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like all these songs or </v>

1536
01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:45.420
<v Speaker 4>loops and I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like bait.</v>

1537
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:49.590
<v Speaker 4>So they put out shitty versions of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's ridiculous.</v>

1538
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:54.090
<v Speaker 4>This didn't Madonna put out one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I got ahold of that one.</v>

1539
01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:59.091
<v Speaker 4>I would love to see that because Madonna</v>
<v Speaker 4>put out one where it was like her music </v>

1540
01:04:59.091 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 4>or her new CD and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he fucking download music,</v>

1541
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll kick your ass or something crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

1542
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 4>If you download music illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll kick your ass.</v>

1543
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:11.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That to me sounds like,</v>

1544
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the fact that they're doing that,</v>

1545
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.500
<v Speaker 4>putting out bogus versions of it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>versions of their shit where they can </v>

1546
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 4>track you from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1547
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 4>it sounds ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just trying to arrest people and</v>

1548
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:25.330
<v Speaker 4>scare people now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's dumb.</v>

1549
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:28.240
<v Speaker 4>They putting out versions of it to track</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1550
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:33.241
<v Speaker 4>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You thought it's like that's like you </v>

1551
01:05:33.241 --> 01:05:33.241
<v Speaker 4>putting out the bait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're putting it out there.</v>

1552
01:05:33.241 --> 01:05:37.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if people are already downloaded </v>

1553
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.521
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually putting it out there </v>

1554
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:39.521
<v Speaker 4>hoping people will do things illegally </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it,</v>

1555
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:39.820
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's out there because of you.</v>

1556
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.480
<v Speaker 4>That seems to me to be fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a funny story man,</v>

1557
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 4>about these undercover cops that </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrested other undercover cops.</v>

1558
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:53.010
<v Speaker 4>There was this whole drug deal that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>set up between these undercover cops </v>

1559
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:57.061

<v Speaker 4>these other undercover cops that were </v>

1560
01:05:57.061 --> 01:05:57.790
<v Speaker 4>posing as buyers to the drugs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they went to arrest each other.</v>

1563
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 4>That's so awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1570
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:20.860
<v Speaker 4>they went to their superiors and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they had anybody else.</v>

1574
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:34.711
<v Speaker 4>If somebody had anybody working </v>
<v Speaker 4>undercover and they always say no to </v>

1575
01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:38.941
<v Speaker 4>that shit because they could be dirty </v>
<v Speaker 4>cops and the dirty cops could pay off </v>

1576
01:06:38.941 --> 01:06:42.781
<v Speaker 4>drug dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The drug dealers find out that these </v>

1577
01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 4>guys were undercover and they kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they always say no.</v>

<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>

1603
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:57.270
<v Speaker 4>So they're saying there's that many </v>
<v Speaker 4>plans are still being grounded because </v>

<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1607
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 4>when I was in Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how crazy was it driving down the </v>

1608
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 4>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing that Mount Rushmore.</v>

1609
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Rushmore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the one?</v>

1610
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.380
<v Speaker 4>What's the one that blew up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuji.</v>

1611
01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Mount Saint Helens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mount Sinai crazy,</v>

1612
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>seeing</v>

01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:18.490
<v Speaker 2>that thing in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this huge volcanoes.</v>

1614
01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People died from that one,</v>

1615
01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1616
01:08:22.101 --> 01:08:27.101
<v Speaker 2>And they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that in Oregon or is that in </v>

1617
01:08:27.101 --> 01:08:27.101
<v Speaker 2>Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 2>State of Washington state to state,</v>

1618
01:08:27.101 --> 01:08:27.410
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can see it.</v>

1619
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we were at,</v>

1620
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>we were on the corner of I guess </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland and Washington.</v>

1621
01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:36.071
<v Speaker 2>It's like right next to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because we're going to Washington </v>

1622
01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:36.071
<v Speaker 2>over this bridge back and forth all day </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

1623
01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:40.451
<v Speaker 2>So I was watching the show on tsunamis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about the Pacific </v>

1624
01:08:40.451 --> 01:08:41.780
<v Speaker 2>northwest and how many times over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last thousand years it's been jacked,</v>

1625
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but civilization,</v>

1626
01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 2>they're so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even realize it.</v>

1627
01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Civilization on the Pacific northwest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States has only been the last</v>

1628
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1629
01:08:49.551 --> 01:08:52.610
<v Speaker 2>so unless you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before that there was Indians of course,</v>

1630
01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking like big buildings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1631
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 2>So like the cycle of them getting hit by</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant tsunamis.</v>

1632
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it happens every thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 2>or so.</v>

1633
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:05.530
<v Speaker 2>The whole side of the country gets hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some fucking 1000 foot high wave </v>

1634
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:06.660
<v Speaker 2>and everything gets crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1635
01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I guess it gets what with Tyler durden </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.com</v>

1636
01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.310
<v Speaker 2>and looked up flights and there's tons </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fights still going on.</v>

1637
01:09:13.311 --> 01:09:16.820
<v Speaker 2>So she was lying so she's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fucked even more.</v>

1638
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dirty bitch.</v>

1639
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 2>She's probably don't cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want to fly.</v>

1640
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Get his lying sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say she can.</v>

1641
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:29.410
<v Speaker 2>She can't get a flight back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>states because of the volcanic ash from </v>

1642
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:32.231
<v Speaker 2>Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Airports all over Europe are jam packed </v>

1643
01:09:32.231 --> 01:09:32.231
<v Speaker 2>and it's impossible to get a seat is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what she's saying.</v>

1644
01:09:32.231 --> 01:09:36.611
<v Speaker 2>But delta has five nonstop flight from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris to New York City and like I guess </v>

1645
01:09:36.741 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 2>they just went through and found all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these flights.</v>

1646
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:42.950
<v Speaker 2>So flights not only there are flights </v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not booked I guess.</v>

1647
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:46.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's what tyler durden do.</v>

1721
01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.930
<v Speaker 5>cheerleaders are too busy touting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>identity politics horn to care what </v>

1722
01:13:01.471 --> 01:13:06.471
<v Speaker 5>comes out of her mouth and that the Miss</v>
<v Speaker 5>USA pageant didn't want to risk the </v>

1723
01:13:06.471 --> 01:13:08.430
<v Speaker 5>wrath of the open borders mob.</v>

1724
01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:14.020
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying that one of the other </v>

<v Speaker 5>checks should've won the who?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd most like to fuck contest.</v>

1726
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:20.240
<v Speaker 5>And you're upset that this chick one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the reason why she won is </v>

1727
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 5>because everybody's super sensitive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to support Arabs.</v>

1728
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how dumb is it that even Miss Usa </v>

1729
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 5>becomes like a topic of debate with </v>
<v Speaker 5>these fuckheads shit.</v>

1730
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.090
<v Speaker 5>I got political correction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>topic of hair.</v>

1731
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 5>She's fucking high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She can be a terrorist.</v>

1732
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 5>She's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she,</v>

1733
01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.920
<v Speaker 5>she grew up going to Catholic school </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1734
01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:43.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean the whole thing is so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>poorly researched and you,</v>

1735
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.410
<v Speaker 5>you're not even making any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're saying that anybody,</v>

1736
01:13:46.411 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 5>even someone who grows up and goes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Catholic school,</v>

1737
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:54.530
<v Speaker 5>they can't be on the team because </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere in their past there's someone </v>

1738
01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.040
<v Speaker 5>who lives in some other part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world and those people are still there </v>

1739
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 5>and it really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

1740
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:07.460
<v Speaker 5>what is that how we're rolling in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean America is a gigantic group of </v>

1741
01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 5>immigrants and this chick and her </v>
<v Speaker 5>family,</v>

1742
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 5>wherever they lived</v>

1743
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 2>sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they came here.</v>

1744
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that they would actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue that she doesn't deserve the </v>

1745
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.861
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who I'd most like to fuck contest </v>

1746
01:14:22.861 --> 01:14:22.861
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if she was fat,</v>

1747
01:14:22.861 --> 01:14:24.090
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1748
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.870
<v Speaker 2>she was like some Susan Boyle can </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>

1749
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>It was totally ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I could see the argument,</v>

1750
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:33.391
<v Speaker 2>but how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck could you argue that that </v>

1751
01:14:33.391 --> 01:14:33.391
<v Speaker 2>check's not hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1752
01:14:33.391 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>What else do you have to do to win Miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>USA?</v>

1753
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:34.930
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>

1754
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 2>what is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to dance?</v>

1755
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to talk?</v>

1756
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:43.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you have like a bathing suit </v>

1757
01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:43.890
<v Speaker 6>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you have to do like some kind of</v>

1758
01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We definitely have to talk.</v>

1759
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:48.100
<v Speaker 2>That's how Perez Hilton busted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kerry [inaudible] check sheet.</v>

1760
01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.750
<v Speaker 2>He asked her about gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1761
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.770
<v Speaker 2>So you have to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're only allowed to have like</v>

1762
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:56.820
<v Speaker 2>small nipples.</v>

<v Speaker 5>O'reilly Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this because there's a lot of </v>

1829
01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:43.790
<v Speaker 5>Douche bags out there and douchebags </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to hear from other Douche bags,</v>

1830
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

1831
01:17:45.311 --> 01:17:50.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of the things he had Richard </v>

1832
01:17:50.311 --> 01:17:52.210
<v Speaker 5>Dawkins on who's this renowned </v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectual and atheist and he wrote </v>

1833
01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:56.890
<v Speaker 5>the God delusion and a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>books about religion and he thinks that </v>

1834
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 5>religion is bad.</v>

1835
01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:02.710
<v Speaker 5>And so he was saying to Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you can't prove that God doesn't </v>

1836
01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:06.380
<v Speaker 5>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm throwing in with God.</v>

1837
01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:09.080
<v Speaker 5>Like he literally said it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1838
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

1839
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:15.580
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's true and there is a god I'm </v>

1840
01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:15.920
<v Speaker 5>throwing in with God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't prove that there is no god,</v>

1841
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 5>which is like how you can't prove.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no cheshire cat.</v>

1842
01:18:19.251 --> 01:18:21.560
<v Speaker 5>You can't prove there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing that you can't,</v>

1843
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:24.230
<v Speaker 5>you can't prove anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can never not prove.</v>

1844
01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:25.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you,</v>

1845
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.190
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to things like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like science has never disproven,</v>

1846
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:30.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the existence of Christ.</v>

1847
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:33.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't disprove someone's existence.</v>

1848
01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 5>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1849
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck do you know who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who existed and who didn't.</v>

1850
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>science isn't there to disprove sciences</v>

1851
01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.640
<v Speaker 5>there to show me some evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If science finds evidence and they </v>

1852
01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:45.640
<v Speaker 5>examine the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it's all about.</v>

1853
01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.290
<v Speaker 5>When there is no evidence and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to determine one way or another,</v>

1854
01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:50.310
<v Speaker 5>you can't disprove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1855
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.260
<v Speaker 5>you could take something like the shroud</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Turin and you know,</v>

1856
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:53.900
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1857
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:56.600
<v Speaker 5>this is Jesus's burial cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sacred.</v>

1858
01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 5>And then you could do well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1859
01:18:57.981 --> 01:19:00.560
<v Speaker 5>let's take a little bit of this cloth </v>
<v Speaker 5>and find out how old it is.</v>

1860
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.050
<v Speaker 5>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's only 500 years old.</v>

1861
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.580
<v Speaker 5>How could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus was cloth.</v>

1862
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:08.780
<v Speaker 5>You disprove it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's fucking dummy.</v>

1863
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 5>So this guy has a huge presence on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>network and he's got.</v>

1864
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 5>He's got the number one show on cable </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it comes to those kind of stupid new</v>

1865
01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:19.490
<v Speaker 5>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a huge show and it's retarded.</v>

1866
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.700
<v Speaker 5>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't watch it.</v>

1867
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.920
<v Speaker 5>Is Nancy Grace on that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She on CNN or is she?</v>

1868
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.450
<v Speaker 5>She's on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1869
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.530

<v Speaker 5>You know you fucked up.</v>

1870
01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 5>If Nancy grace was talking about you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if Nancy grace was talking about you,</v>

1871
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:38.141
<v Speaker 5>there's a dead baby or you know you </v>
<v Speaker 5>drowned your wife or something.</v>

1872
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something serious.</v>

<v Speaker 5>hawk on the same subjects for weeks </v>

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 5>waiting for the next disaster to pop up </v>
<v Speaker 5>the news so she could switch gears.</v>

1875

<v Speaker 5>She talked about tiger woods for two </v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have collected a bunch of clips about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the local Fox news channel and not only </v>

<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>

1903
01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1904
01:20:53.290 --> 01:20:56.370
<v Speaker 4>You've sent when you put one of those on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the message on the message board.</v>

1905
01:20:56.371 --> 01:20:59.400
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny because I have danced </v>
<v Speaker 4>when every time he does the weather,</v>

1906
01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like that,</v>

1907
01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Why not let them fucking dance?</v>

1909
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:10.700
<v Speaker 4>But it's so funny how bad it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was the other day something </v>

1910
01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:10.700
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

1911
01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be wet outside there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know a lot about wet,</v>

1912
01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:12.150
<v Speaker 4>don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tina?</v>

1913
01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:12.930
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1914
01:21:12.931 --> 01:21:15.880
<v Speaker 4>that's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like to go there,</v>

1915
01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.570
<v Speaker 4>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you really serious?</v>

1916
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:23.571
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that video clip where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>a black guy is sitting with these three </v>

1917
01:21:23.571 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 4>white chicks and they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>some new graft and Berg spot shot.</v>

1918
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like a shot of Collagen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They shoot inside a chick's pussy.</v>

1919
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.760
<v Speaker 4>They live with a needle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They jab her fucking snatch and stuff </v>

1920
01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:34.760
<v Speaker 4>this liquid up there.</v>

1921
01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 4>And apparently it makes sex feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It like in it,</v>

1922
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 4>in it makes the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enhances that g spot.</v>

1923
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they do this,</v>

1924
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:45.480
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black guy goes,</v>

1925
01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I guess she's enjoying penis now.</v>

1926
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:51.750
<v Speaker 4>More like he said that and all three </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicks were like,</v>

1927
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1928
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's enjoying sexual relations again,</v>

1929
01:21:56.971 --> 01:21:58.290
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she tried to somehow under that,</v>

1930
01:21:58.291 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 4>cleaned it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though he used,</v>

1931
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:05.300
<v Speaker 4>he used the right terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he used the medical terminology </v>

1932
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.180
<v Speaker 4>and he didn't say anything really </v>
<v Speaker 4>inappropriate.</v>

1933
01:22:06.181 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what sexual intercourse </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1934
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:08.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's enjoying his penis,</v>

1935
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 4>but somehow the fact that he mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1936
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.400
<v Speaker 4>it was like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking candyman three times or </v>

1937
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:16.400
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1938
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 4>So in shooting joe his penis and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>black too.</v>

1939
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:23.030
<v Speaker 4>And so there's this black dude would </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a half a heart on three white </v>

1940
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 4>chicks talking about their spot getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>pumped up.</v>

1941
01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:25.980
<v Speaker 4>I bet he fucks him.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You start making out and she grabbed </v>

01:24:26.671 --> 01:24:29.350
<v Speaker 5>your Dick and she starts kissing you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>she squeezes your deck a little bit.</v>

1982
01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:31.120
<v Speaker 5>Like she's looking for more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's that?</v>

1983
01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:36.400
<v Speaker 5>Where's the ass?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she stops and then she goes,</v>

1984
01:24:36.401 --> 01:24:40.480
<v Speaker 5>we shouldn't do this because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't do this.</v>

1985
01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:46.190
<v Speaker 5>And then you look over on a nightstand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just fucking hulking black guy </v>

1986
01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:49.891
<v Speaker 5>and a picture frame that God has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>delivering the Dick to her for the past </v>

1987
01:24:49.891 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 5>few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you just go,</v>

1988
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.670
<v Speaker 5>who?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's that?</v>

1989
01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.360
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't they take nothing fixed that now </v>

1990
01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.270
<v Speaker 4>technology to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a gas pump they haven't fixed.</v>

1991
01:24:59.271 --> 01:25:02.810
<v Speaker 4>That can take like an ankle out of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>foot or grow your Dick.</v>

1992
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cannot fix dicks.</v>

1993
01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:07.010
<v Speaker 4>They can't extend it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can take something out of your butt</v>

1994
01:25:07.011 --> 01:25:12.011
<v Speaker 4>and put it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they can make a fake dick if </v>

1995
01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:12.011
<v Speaker 4>you're a chick.</v>

1996
01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:15.830
<v Speaker 5>Apparently chastity Bono who used to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and when she is still shares </v>

1997
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:20.361
<v Speaker 5>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now she's a boy because she went </v>

1998
01:25:20.361 --> 01:25:23.961
<v Speaker 5>through a sexual reassignment and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>give her a bunch of hormones and they </v>

1999
01:25:23.961 --> 01:25:27.730
<v Speaker 5>make her a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think it's.</v>

2000
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.020
<v Speaker 5>It feels the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it shoots loads.</v>

2001
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:36.260
<v Speaker 5>That's grossest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they take the Deq and make it a </v>

2002
01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:36.260
<v Speaker 5>pussy where they split it out like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>apple.</v>

2003
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:40.050
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that or what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>China really have a man.</v>

2004
01:25:40.051 --> 01:25:43.940
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How fucked up is your wiring that you.</v>

2005
01:25:43.941 --> 01:25:47.060
<v Speaker 5>You don't even like your part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to switch to a girl part,</v>

2006
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.470
<v Speaker 5>you're embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really wish you were a woman.</v>

2007
01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:54.210
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that they really are women </v>
<v Speaker 5>trapped in men's or did you do.</v>

2008
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.300
<v Speaker 5>I do believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what about the possibility that </v>

2009
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.491
<v Speaker 5>throughout their life they've just </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced so much sorrow and so much </v>

2010
01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 5>stress and so many fucked situations</v>

2011
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:09.370
<v Speaker 2>and so much trauma in their life and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of that they're probably gay and </v>

2012
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:12.260
<v Speaker 2>they're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2013
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 2>more at the very least bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know their orientation naturally.</v>

2014
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:21.190
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this natural sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation that leans towards </v>

2015
01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:25.211
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality and massive depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness and they just decided that </v>

2016
01:26:25.211 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 2>they want to be a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible too,</v>

2017
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:27.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have Nami at a mom makes you A.</v>

2019
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2020
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's either or rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any one scenario,</v>

2021
01:26:38.061 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 2>but I think with some people they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>

2022
01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:45.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a man who becomes a woman just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're fucked up and whether </v>

2023
01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:45.060
<v Speaker 2>they're getting late either and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>full.</v>

2024
01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:49.661
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get dixon me trick people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then from others I think others are </v>

2025
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2026
01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2027
01:26:51.861 --> 01:26:56.861
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a broad spectrum of human </v>

2028
01:26:56.861 --> 01:26:56.861
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

2029
01:26:56.861 --> 01:26:56.861
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2030
01:26:56.861 --> 01:26:56.861
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2031
01:26:56.861 --> 01:27:01.301
<v Speaker 2>very likely to me that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another just someone gets a wacky gene </v>

2032
01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:01.301
<v Speaker 2>and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2033
01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:02.600
<v Speaker 2>why don't I have a vagina?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2034
01:27:02.601 --> 01:27:04.000
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

2035
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>they have this feeling like they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing something because they have a </v>

2036
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.680
<v Speaker 2>penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a goddamn commitment.</v>

2037
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:13.250
<v Speaker 2>That is a God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the movie was,</v>

2038
01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:18.251
<v Speaker 2>but there was some movie where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy in a tranny were yelling at </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2040
01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:20.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2041
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:25.480
<v Speaker 2>and she's like in the train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was yelling at the guy and the guy </v>

<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have an addict anymore.</v>

2043
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.080
<v Speaker 2>You're so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You chopped off your Dick.</v>

2044

<v Speaker 2>I didn't chop up my dick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's been cut in half.</v>

2048
01:27:35.271 --> 01:27:37.130
<v Speaker 2>What movie was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2049
01:27:37.131 --> 01:27:42.131
<v Speaker 2>But there were paraphrasing obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't remember where it came </v>

2050
01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:42.131
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some movie or something,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thailand and was kicking a lot of ass.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we were fucking dresses and shit,</v>

2059

<v Speaker 2>But then he went to the operation and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got his balls removed and when he got </v>

2062
01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 2>his bowels removed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wrap son.</v>

2063
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 2>No more testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A baby.</v>

2064
01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:17.190
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2065
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.260
<v Speaker 2>the flow stops completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he shriveled up and got a woman like</v>

2066
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:23.970
<v Speaker 2>and started getting fucked up and had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2067
01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many fights you had as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman at an actual woman after they </v>

2068
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 2>took his balls off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they took his balls off,</v>

2069
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:32.120
<v Speaker 2>he was useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They beat the shit out of that full.</v>

2070
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes you a man with cancer </v>

2071
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:43.811
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You automatically start getting more </v>

2072
01:28:43.811 --> 01:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>woman like a wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2073
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2074
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I think with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some guys,</v>

2075
01:28:46.851 --> 01:28:51.851
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wind up supplementing the </v>

2076
01:28:51.851 --> 01:28:51.851
<v Speaker 2>testosterone because their balls don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2077
01:28:51.851 --> 01:28:56.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of bodybuilders having to do </v>

2078
01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.331
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bodybuilders get to a point where </v>

2079
01:28:58.331 --> 01:29:00.101
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shoot so much testing to their by </v>

2080
01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>their bowels just shut down for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their balls won't come back.</v>

2081
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to like</v>

2082
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.030
<v Speaker 4>give themselves testosterone shots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching that China porn the other</v>

2083

<v Speaker 4>so we didn't know her.</v>

2186
01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:24.721
<v Speaker 4>She just came over and sat down at our </v>
<v Speaker 4>table and no one knew her and she just </v>

01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:26.500
<v Speaker 4>came over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sat down like she's like a monster.</v>

2188
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:29.530
<v Speaker 4>And she saw a victim and she saw that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was weak.</v>

2189
01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:34.650
<v Speaker 4>She saw he was like so sloshed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't keep his shit together and </v>

2190
01:34:34.650 --> 01:34:37.810
<v Speaker 4>he was leaning back and when he closed </v>
<v Speaker 4>his eyes and leaned his head back,</v>

2191
01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.960
<v Speaker 4>she just moved in for the kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She made the physical contact and he </v>

2192
01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.371
<v Speaker 4>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought it was the girl and she had </v>

2193
01:34:47.371 --> 01:34:49.291
<v Speaker 4>an arm on him like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he just responded to the physical </v>

2194
01:34:49.291 --> 01:34:49.390
<v Speaker 4>contact thinking that it was this hot </v>
<v Speaker 4>waitress.</v>

2195

2197
01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:59.510
<v Speaker 4>We both have shit on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's,</v>

2198
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:03.950
<v Speaker 4>he's tongue in this chick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he looks at her and he looks at</v>

<v Speaker 4>her and he goes like this</v>

<v Speaker 7>away and she's like touching his face </v>
<v Speaker 7>and everything and he just goes like </v>

2208
01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:35.260
<v Speaker 7>I totally thought it was the waitress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2209
01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:36.610
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>How the fuck are going to stop you?</v>

2211
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:41.560
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she sat down next to you.</v>

2212
01:35:41.561 --> 01:35:44.770
<v Speaker 7>You lean towards her and that pitches </v>
<v Speaker 7>planned it perfectly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She realized that you realized that she,</v>

<v Speaker 4>she took off right after that was her </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2221
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:06.500

<v Speaker 4>She realized that she had tricks,</v>

2222
01:36:06.501 --> 01:36:10.490
<v Speaker 4>some poor young man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just how gross it was that that chair</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh fuck.</v>

2316
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:50.220

<v Speaker 5>phone.</v>

2317
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2318
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.880

<v Speaker 5>He goes to,</v>

2324
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.600

<v Speaker 5>will come back and get me.</v>

2325
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:08.490

<v Speaker 5>He had been in the car for an hour.</v>

2329
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:15.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like an hour ride.</v>

2330
01:40:15.601 --> 01:40:20.601
<v Speaker 5>Was he sleeping when he got like when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>got the phone with them at eight in the </v>

2331
01:40:20.601 --> 01:40:20.601
<v Speaker 5>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went down there.</v>

2332
01:40:20.601 --> 01:40:22.170
<v Speaker 5>The car was already there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just told the guy he was me,</v>

2333
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 5>got in the car and woke up like an hour </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the drive on the way to the </v>

2334
01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:31.521
<v Speaker 5>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>woke up without any memory of the night </v>

2335
01:40:31.521 --> 01:40:34.671
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woke up in the car with his phone </v>

2336
01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:37.971
<v Speaker 5>ringing it literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like an old man.</v>

2337
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:46.910
<v Speaker 5>He literally had no idea what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't remember a fucking thing </v>

2338
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.980
<v Speaker 5>about the night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2339
01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:51.660
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How terrifying must be to have like some</v>

2340
01:40:51.661 --> 01:40:56.661
<v Speaker 5>like just like litter of behavior around</v>
<v Speaker 5>you and you don't even know what you </v>

2341
01:40:57.311 --> 01:41:02.311
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you created all this problems and </v>

2342
01:41:02.311 --> 01:41:02.920
<v Speaker 5>caused all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get all fucking angry at you and shed.</v>

2343
01:41:02.921 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were just shit faced.</v>

2344
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.970
<v Speaker 5>Blacked out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gone.</v>

2345
01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:12.380
<v Speaker 6>And then he had to get on a flight like </v>
<v Speaker 6>I really long asked flight back home </v>

2346
01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.610
<v Speaker 6>with that hangover fucking 11 hours in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Germany.</v>

2347
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:19.110
<v Speaker 6>Being drunk and hungover on a plane is </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably the worst thing ever and I hate</v>

2348
01:41:19.111 --> 01:41:19.860
<v Speaker 6>it so much.</v>

2349
01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:22.270
<v Speaker 5>Is it though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you just sleep well?</v>

2350
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 5>What's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it harder?</v>

2351
01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.890
<v Speaker 5>Is it really like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like you're at high altitude</v>

2352
01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:28.580
<v Speaker 5>when you're on a plane?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously you're at high altitude,</v>

2353
01:41:28.590 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 5>but the cabinets pressurized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there the same amount of oxygen there</v>

2354
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:36.691
<v Speaker 5>is if you're at high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously not because like when you're </v>

2355
01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:36.691
<v Speaker 5>at 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>feet,</v>

2356
01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:38.720
<v Speaker 5>that's like Mount Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could fucking die up there.</v>

2357
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.810
<v Speaker 5>There's no oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a stupid question.</v>

2358
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is obviously way more oxygen </v>

2359
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 5>than at 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>feet.</v>

2360
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 5>That was a dumb question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I asked it.</v>

2361
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.950
<v Speaker 5>I believe in the weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you're,</v>

2362
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:53.280
<v Speaker 5>when you're in a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does your hangover feeling any worse?</v>

2363
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:58.350
<v Speaker 6>To me it always does and it's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well of course I have acid reflux and </v>

2364
01:41:58.350 --> 01:42:02.671
<v Speaker 6>all this shit that's fucking with me and</v>
<v Speaker 6>so maybe it's worse for the Gremlin in </v>

2365
01:42:02.671 --> 01:42:03.820
<v Speaker 6>your asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So criminal in my Bailey Bailey.</v>

2366
01:42:04.190 --> 01:42:05.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about planes,</v>

2367
01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.510
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you sleep on a plane,</v>

2368
01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.180
<v Speaker 5>even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2369
01:42:09.181 --> 01:42:14.181
<v Speaker 5>you go and you come back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about just getting up </v>

2370
01:42:14.181 --> 01:42:14.181
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>traveling and coming back.</v>

2371
01:42:14.181 --> 01:42:17.810
<v Speaker 5>That leaves you feeling fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just definitely feel a little off.</v>

2372
01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.480
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is a plane?</v>

2373
01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.860
<v Speaker 6>I think it's the change of pressure.</v>

2374
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:28.020
<v Speaker 5>The pressure or is it just getting in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this tube with recycled oxygen and </v>

2375
01:42:29.381 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 5>everybody's bringing their own Ehr?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

2376
01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.570
<v Speaker 6>I think it's that because I actually saw</v>
<v Speaker 6>a report saying that those,</v>

2377
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.370
<v Speaker 6>that recycled air summit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best air and it's actually just like</v>

2378
01:42:37.371 --> 01:42:42.371
<v Speaker 6>an old wives tale that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's bad for you and it's actually </v>

2379
01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:44.270
<v Speaker 6>the filtering system in those planes are</v>
<v Speaker 6>so amazing.</v>

2380
01:42:44.271 --> 01:42:49.271
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is it that makes you so </v>

2381
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:49.271
<v Speaker 6>tired from flying?</v>

2382
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Cause that Shit Jacks you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no getting around it.</v>

2383
01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:55.050
<v Speaker 5>It checks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I always like to do when I</v>

2384
01:42:55.051 --> 01:42:56.610
<v Speaker 5>land somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I have the time,</v>

2385
01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.820
<v Speaker 5>I always have a hard workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hard workout seems to reset </v>

2386
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:02.040
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you don't have that hard workout,</v>

2387
01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:03.800
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna.</v>

2388
01:43:03.801 --> 01:43:05.640
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna be fucked up for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>of days.</v>

2389
01:43:05.670 --> 01:43:07.650
<v Speaker 5>It takes a couple days to feel normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

2390
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:08.700
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

2391
01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 6>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2392
01:43:11.201 --> 01:43:13.570
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to thinking about this the</v>
<v Speaker 6>other day and it's kind of on subject,</v>

2393
01:43:13.571 --> 01:43:18.571
<v Speaker 6>but about workouts where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like how you know how you can even </v>

2394
01:43:18.571 --> 01:43:20.400
<v Speaker 6>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To me when I forget who it.</v>

2395
01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:22.720
<v Speaker 6>Jimmy Kimmel was talking about this the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other day where he,</v>

2396
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:25.450
<v Speaker 6>when he gets done working out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he does not feel great.</v>

2397
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:27.340
<v Speaker 6>He feels awful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wants to go sleep.</v>

2398
01:43:27.341 --> 01:43:28.270
<v Speaker 6>He feels sad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's.</v>

2399
01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.670
<v Speaker 6>He hates it and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you work out,</v>

2400
01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:33.130
<v Speaker 6>you have the exact opposite feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel like,</v>

2401
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:34.480
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:43:34.481 --> 01:43:39.481
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fired up and feel great and you </v>

2403
01:43:39.481 --> 01:43:39.481
<v Speaker 6>feel great and like a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am like Jimmy Kimmel though.</v>

2404
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:41.830
<v Speaker 6>Like when I work out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not happy.</v>

2405
01:43:41.831 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm miserable after I work out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2406
01:43:44.530 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 6>why do you think that is?</v>

2407
01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:46.620
<v Speaker 5>It'll be two reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

2408
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:51.630
<v Speaker 5>because you're out of shape and working </v>
<v Speaker 5>out as painful and then the recovery is </v>

2409
01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:51.630
<v Speaker 5>even more painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2410
01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:56.110
<v Speaker 5>but even when I was in her shape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>better in shape and that would work out </v>

2411
01:43:56.110 --> 01:43:57.560
<v Speaker 5>I never have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were you ever in really good shape?</v>

2412
01:43:58.150 --> 01:43:59.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2413
01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:04.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been in shape a couple times in my </v>

2414
01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:04.090
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like pretty good shift.</v>

2415
01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:05.990
<v Speaker 5>Were you working out and you feel I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>working out every day,</v>

2416
01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 5>six days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five days a week.</v>

2417
01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.880
<v Speaker 5>When you're working on what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise you're doing,</v>

2418
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:13.460
<v Speaker 5>how much exercise are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like 45 minutes to an hour of cardio and</v>

2419
01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:14.630
<v Speaker 5>then like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>

2420
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:19.631
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes of that was my prime was 43.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You like really fucking sweating and he </v>

2421
01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:19.631
<v Speaker 5>even in Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2422
01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:20.180
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2423
01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:25.300
<v Speaker 5>But I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never enjoyed it and always hated it </v>

2424
01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:25.300
<v Speaker 5>after it was done.</v>

2425
01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.230
<v Speaker 5>Just a runner's high when it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

2426
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 5>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just wondering like,</v>

2427
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:32.640
<v Speaker 5>because like I've heard you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it before and then Kim was talking about</v>

2428
01:44:32.641 --> 01:44:34.190
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how is the exact opposite for him?</v>

2429
01:44:34.191 --> 01:44:35.000
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2430
01:44:35.001 --> 01:44:38.090
<v Speaker 5>that's same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell you how your body works.</v>

2431
01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.280
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's body has its own different </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2432
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's body works differently at </v>

2433
01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:48.091
<v Speaker 5>different levels of efficiency and some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's bodies need extreme amounts of </v>

2434
01:44:48.091 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 5>exertion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need exercise.</v>

2435
01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 5>And mine could be because I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it because you know,</v>

2436
01:44:53.421 --> 01:44:54.550
<v Speaker 5>my whole life I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2437
01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's never been a time in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>life except like in between surgeries.</v>

2438
01:44:58.770 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 5>There's never been a time in my life </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I didn't have some sort of extreme</v>

2439
01:45:03.291 --> 01:45:08.291
<v Speaker 5>exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's kickboxing or Jujitsu or </v>

2440
01:45:08.291 --> 01:45:09.350
<v Speaker 5>lifting weights or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or boxing for a while.</v>

2441
01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Everything was always just explosion.</v>

2442
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:12.830
<v Speaker 5>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2443
01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 5>my body's always been forced to behave a</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain way.</v>

2444
01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.150
<v Speaker 5>And when your body's forced to behave </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that for over 20 years,</v>

2445
01:45:20.630 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes accustomed to it.</v>

2446
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:25.490
<v Speaker 5>And when I take a few days off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take three or four days off.</v>

2447
01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:30.730
<v Speaker 5>I have this buildup of energy where when</v>
<v Speaker 5>my body is used to producing a certain </v>

2448
01:45:30.730 --> 01:45:31.640
<v Speaker 5>amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get any of that energy.</v>

2449
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 5>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That energy.</v>

2450
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:35.770
<v Speaker 5>I actually have the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think it's because hired 99.</v>

2451
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.390
<v Speaker 5>I've never really been in the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shape that kinda shape.</v>

2452
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for me,</v>

2453
01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:44.660
<v Speaker 5>and it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bio mechanics are not biomechanics.</v>

2454
01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 5>Bio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a bio.</v>

2455
01:45:46.521 --> 01:45:51.521
<v Speaker 5>Rhythms rather biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Different people need different things </v>

2456
01:45:51.521 --> 01:45:51.521
<v Speaker 5>out of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2457
01:45:51.521 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 5>some people need extreme exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2458
01:45:53.451 --> 01:45:58.451
<v Speaker 5>some people just need a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people feel great when they just </v>

2459
01:45:58.451 --> 01:45:58.451
<v Speaker 5>walk up a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2460
01:45:58.451 --> 01:46:02.320
<v Speaker 5>they just go for a little walk around </v>
<v Speaker 5>their neighborhood and they feel </v>

2461
01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:02.320
<v Speaker 5>refreshed.</v>

2462
01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 5>They don't need that extreme physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>exertion.</v>

2463
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 5>It me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to hit the bag,</v>

2464
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:07.250
<v Speaker 5>I need to do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to do some kettle bells,</v>

2465
01:46:07.251 --> 01:46:08.800
<v Speaker 5>I need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I do it it's like,</v>

2466
01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:15.110
<v Speaker 5>like I can be myself again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I blow it all out and then I'm</v>

2467
01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:17.360
<v Speaker 5>on myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I don't,</v>

2468
01:46:17.361 --> 01:46:20.390
<v Speaker 5>it builds up and builds up for one day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's tolerable.</v>

2469
01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:24.050
<v Speaker 5>Two days it's a little less tolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three days a little less and then by the</v>

2470
01:46:24.051 --> 01:46:26.750
<v Speaker 5>time four or five days go by where no </v>
<v Speaker 5>workouts at all,</v>

2471
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 5>I start getting very edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2472
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 5>I feel like people were talking to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're not,</v>

2473
01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:34.130
<v Speaker 5>they're not talking quick enough and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>a rude.</v>

2474
01:46:34.131 --> 01:46:34.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2475
01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:35.870
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2476
01:46:35.871 --> 01:46:36.740
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

2477
01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.860
<v Speaker 5>I get it because my patients has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have no patience.</v>

2478
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's caveman jeans.</v>

2479
01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.850
<v Speaker 5>I've got way too much caveman in me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2480
01:46:43.851 --> 01:46:48.851
<v Speaker 5>there was some sort of a study recently </v>
<v Speaker 5>that about people that have neanderthal </v>

2481
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 5>genetics and they have a certain</v>

2482
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:55.100
<v Speaker 2>percent fucking for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do for sure if there's people out </v>

2483
01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 2>there that have neanderthal jeanette </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics and their system.</v>

2484
01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I've got some of that shit for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere in my life.</v>

2485
01:47:00.031 --> 01:47:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Somebody fucked an eight man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2486
01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:05.760
<v Speaker 2>somewhere way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in my family's ancestry.</v>

2487
01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:10.761
<v Speaker 2>Someone fucked one of those little crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight men where I'm like a lesbian </v>

2488
01:47:10.761 --> 01:47:14.040

<v Speaker 2>You are very feminine.</v>

2489
01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:19.800
<v Speaker 2>You're very feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you liked girls.</v>

2490
01:47:19.801 --> 01:47:21.960
<v Speaker 2>What's that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body,</v>

<v Speaker 2>against each other.</v>

2501

<v Speaker 2>The most sensitive part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to get stuffed.</v>

2502
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.280
<v Speaker 2>They're missing a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're missing something in the middle </v>

<v Speaker 2>or better.</v>

2506
01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2507
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel pretty fucking good.</v>

2508
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how Lesbians Vagina feels,</v>

2509
01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:17.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think heterosexual woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately need to get stuffed.</v>

2510
01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:22.610
<v Speaker 2>That's why dudes desperately need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuffing in them and it just makes </v>

2511
01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:22.610
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What feels the best to you?</v>

2512
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:27.680
<v Speaker 2>The magical fucking promise land to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hard supersensitive Dick inside the</v>

2513
01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:31.470
<v Speaker 2>word pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's nature.</v>

2514
01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the great reward.</v>

2515
01:48:33.121 --> 01:48:36.060
<v Speaker 2>The great reward is this intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure because that's the way you make</v>

2516
01:48:36.061 --> 01:48:36.540
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>

2517
01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:41.660
<v Speaker 2>So for a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intense pleasure has got to come </v>

2518
01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.211
<v Speaker 2>from getting stuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the owning that makes sense from </v>

2519
01:48:44.211 --> 01:48:44.760
<v Speaker 2>getting a big fat dick to shoot goo </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside you.</v>

2520
01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:46.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2521
01:48:46.670 --> 01:48:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2522
01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.720
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a staple of our life and it's this </v>

2523
01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 2>big important part of our desires and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our motivation to do things,</v>

2524
01:48:53.941 --> 01:48:57.270
<v Speaker 2>but really it's just a trick to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>people you know,</v>

2525
01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:02.330
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that trick is got to be set up </v>

2526
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.330
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2527
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:03.660
<v Speaker 2>people have been around for a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years in this form.</v>

2528
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:06.180
<v Speaker 2>That trick is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got it down and if it's,</v>

2529
01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.460
<v Speaker 2>if it's down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got a good,</v>

2530
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:10.920
<v Speaker 2>then that means chicks must love big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dicks inside them.</v>

2531
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:16.040
<v Speaker 2>And if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then scissoring is not going to be </v>

2532
01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:16.040
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna feel good,</v>

2533
01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.311
<v Speaker 2>it'll feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is that actually wants </v>

2534
01:49:19.311 --> 01:49:21.840
<v Speaker 2>to get filled up and once you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stretched out with Cox on you </v>

2535
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>and looking at me and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee all day long,</v>

2536
01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:28.800
<v Speaker 2>try to make it uncomfortable.</v>

2537
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.800
<v Speaker 2>So I try to make you uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm damn well is that,</v>

2538
01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 2>that's me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an earthquake.</v>

2539
01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:44.991
<v Speaker 2>We have much better sound now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I'm laughing and what used to </v>

2540
01:49:44.991 --> 01:49:47.350
<v Speaker 2>not be annoying now it will be annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This week we're using these microphones,</v>

2541
01:49:47.351 --> 01:49:52.351
<v Speaker 2>but next week we're going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>clip on jammies because this is </v>

2542
01:49:52.351 --> 01:49:54.391
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be standing here like </v>

2543
01:49:54.391 --> 01:49:54.391
<v Speaker 2>a standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do kind of like it though for the fact</v>

2544
01:49:54.391 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 2>if I need to like drink water or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2545
01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:57.550
<v Speaker 2>I could go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:49:58.150 --> 01:50:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should just leave it like this </v>

2547
01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:03.150
<v Speaker 2>because maybe getting a mic stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes right here though,</v>

2548
01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:04.060
<v Speaker 2>so we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2549
01:50:04.061 --> 01:50:09.061
<v Speaker 2>we could totally do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't want anything that </v>

2550
01:50:09.061 --> 01:50:09.061
<v Speaker 2>knocks around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as we have the headphones on,</v>

2551
01:50:09.061 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the move because for the longest </v>
<v Speaker 2>time we were doing this and I just look,</v>

2552
01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a couple of retards and we shoe </v>

2553
01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 2>string this shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it looks pretty killer.</v>

2554
01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 2>We got like we had a mixer board and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2555
01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you guys all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2556
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:25.570
<v Speaker 2>the autofocus is not something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could turn off.</v>

2557
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:29.110
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got all this shit here.</v>

2558
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:34.410
<v Speaker 2>We've got a soundboard now connected to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two laptops connected to this high </v>

2559
01:50:35.591 --> 01:50:40.591
<v Speaker 2>level MP3 recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamey and it's all just mishmashed and </v>

2560
01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:45.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking sea of wires and that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates this podcast.</v>

2561
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully that'll be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now that we have the sound issues out</v>

2562
01:50:49.991 --> 01:50:54.991
<v Speaker 2>of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually we're going to have to deal </v>

2563
01:50:54.991 --> 01:50:54.991
<v Speaker 2>with this goddamn green screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's step two.</v>

2564
01:50:54.991 --> 01:50:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple different options to do</v>

2565
01:50:56.411 --> 01:51:01.411
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of them seem super fucking </v>

2566
01:51:01.411 --> 01:51:01.411
<v Speaker 2>complicated in a pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2567
01:51:01.411 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I think we just do a TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a three D tv.</v>

2568
01:51:02.711 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 2>We can check shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can turn it on.</v>

2569
01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Things that we couldn't do it through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ustream producer if we're going to </v>

2570
01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.230
<v Speaker 2>do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The caster,</v>

2571
01:51:12.330 --> 01:51:15.340
<v Speaker 2>the fucking track asked her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can go through that.</v>

2572
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I think you can do it through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we would have this entire,</v>

2573
01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:21.010
<v Speaker 2>the same audio setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just way overkill and you</v>

2574
01:51:21.011 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 2>do a tri caster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three ustream producer now it just seems</v>

2575
01:51:23.651 --> 01:51:28.120
<v Speaker 2>weird post on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anybody knows to give us a simple way</v>

2576
01:51:28.121 --> 01:51:29.920
<v Speaker 2>to do a green screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>

2577
01:51:29.921 --> 01:51:34.921
<v Speaker 2>if anybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw me up some message or a link on </v>

2578
01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:36.700
<v Speaker 2>twitter at Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be some tech audio visual</v>

2579
01:51:36.701 --> 01:51:41.701
<v Speaker 2>wizard out there that knows how to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should tell you stream what's the </v>

2580
01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:42.430
<v Speaker 2>best hookup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think ustream knows.</v>

2581
01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped doing those ads.</v>

2582
01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:47.410
<v Speaker 2>They have these ads that would pop up </v>
<v Speaker 2>every 30 seconds.</v>

2583
01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Remember there was a bunch of people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining.</v>

2584
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ads.</v>

2585
01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.640
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just an ad that popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like took over the sound and </v>

2586
01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:55.960
<v Speaker 2>audio and video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was ridiculous.</v>

2587
01:51:56.490 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Who was it for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it macy's?</v>

2588
01:51:58.331 --> 01:52:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Macy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which macy's want to have anything to do</v>

2589
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:02.690
<v Speaker 2>with me too because they have fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

2590
01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about ghetto gaggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did you hear about that Dildo that</v>

2591
01:52:07.181 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 2>was discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty 8,000</v>

2592
01:52:08.531 --> 01:52:10.840
<v Speaker 2>year old though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about that?</v>

2593
01:52:10.841 --> 01:52:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they know that it was a Dildo?</v>

2594
01:52:12.690 --> 01:52:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Not just like an ear cleaner or like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year care massager.</v>

2595
01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Big is your fucking ears side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2596
01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Because it looks like a big stone Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's eight inches long.</v>

2597
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was the preferred site was used</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something else.</v>

2598
01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.180
<v Speaker 2>What was it was used to strike flint's </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2599
01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:30.850
<v Speaker 2>They had all these marks on it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's striking flint's,</v>

2600
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:32.750
<v Speaker 2>but that just could have been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>husband like,</v>

2601
01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:35.470
<v Speaker 2>give me that fucking vibrator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GimMe Your Gimme your dildo.</v>

2602
01:52:35.471 --> 01:52:40.471
<v Speaker 2>I need to make a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got all angry and shit and he was </v>

2603
01:52:40.471 --> 01:52:40.471
<v Speaker 2>attacking the Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2604
01:52:40.471 --> 01:52:45.001
<v Speaker 2>it could have been that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why he used it as a dual </v>

2605
01:52:45.001 --> 01:52:45.001
<v Speaker 2>purpose instrument.</v>

2606
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.640
<v Speaker 5>But that'd be a smart move to have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2607
01:52:47.650 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you don't want to have that </v>
<v Speaker 5>many stones land around the cave,</v>

2608
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:53.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not use it for dual purposes.</v>

2609
01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:56.620
<v Speaker 5>I was in Portland and they had the or </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2610
01:52:56.630 --> 01:53:01.160
<v Speaker 5>the biggest top rex with all the bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best selection.</v>

2611
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>T rex o,</v>

2612
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:04.820
<v Speaker 5>t,</v>
<v Speaker 5>o really had the biggest collection,</v>

2613
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:06.250
<v Speaker 5>a t rex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was like,</v>

2614
01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:09.530
<v Speaker 5>I forget how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 70 percent real bone.</v>

2615
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:14.650
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole thing was up and it's so </v>

2616
01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:15.770
<v Speaker 5>weird sitting there by that skull of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this dinosaur and just thinking,</v>

2617
01:53:15.771 --> 01:53:18.320
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that used to be a fucking monster,</v>

2618
01:53:18.321 --> 01:53:19.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a real thing.</v>

2619
01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:23.090
<v Speaker 5>So weird that you're allowed to like go </v>
<v Speaker 5>up to it and touch it,</v>

2620
01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 5>see it and wonder how many things </v>
<v Speaker 5>existed that there are not fossils of.</v>

2621
01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:33.050
<v Speaker 5>Because one of the things when you start</v>
<v Speaker 5>reading things about fossils and about,</v>

2622
01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:38.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>archeologists and all these different </v>

2623
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.571
<v Speaker 5>people are trying to dig up the past is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's really difficult to make a </v>

2624
01:53:40.571 --> 01:53:41.090
<v Speaker 5>fossil.</v>

2625
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:43.190
<v Speaker 5>Like fossils don't just happen all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2626
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:45.260
<v Speaker 5>Like an animal has to get trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 5>mud.</v>

2627
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:48.410
<v Speaker 5>They have to die and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a landslide or something.</v>

2628
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:50.510
<v Speaker 5>They have to be somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 5>preserved,</v>

2629
01:53:50.511 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 5>which usually doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Usually when someone dies,</v>

2630
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.920
<v Speaker 5>they rot in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their bones,</v>

2631
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:59.921
<v Speaker 5>get eaten up by animals and their tissue</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets eaten up by animals and bacteria </v>

2632
01:53:59.921 --> 01:53:59.921
<v Speaker 5>and then they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They dissolve.</v>

2633
01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:03.230
<v Speaker 5>How many fucking things existed that </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't in the fossil record,</v>

2634
01:54:03.710 --> 01:54:05.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>properly.</v>

2635
01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.170
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably the majority really thinks so.</v>

2636
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:12.770
<v Speaker 5>You would think though that species </v>
<v Speaker 5>around for millions and millions of </v>

2637
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.770
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2638
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.770
<v Speaker 5>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2639
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:17.200
<v Speaker 5>they're around for a long period of time</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then eventually they die off and </v>

2640
01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:20.351
<v Speaker 5>before they die off for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've had plenty of opportunity for at </v>

2641
01:54:20.351 --> 01:54:21.420
<v Speaker 5>least a few of them to get stuck places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2642
01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:22.060
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2643
01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 5>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know so little.</v>

2644
01:54:25.431 --> 01:54:30.431
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy that we try to reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 5>the past or figure out what happened in </v>

2645
01:54:30.431 --> 01:54:32.540
<v Speaker 5>the past by studying what was left </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind.</v>

2646
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like a giant crazy puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't it be more?</v>

2647
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't it be incredible and maybe this</v>
<v Speaker 5>will be possible some day if they figure</v>

2648
01:54:40.191 --> 01:54:43.360
<v Speaker 5>out like say if they make a model like </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2649
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:44.750
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the earth,</v>

2650
01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:49.751
<v Speaker 5>like they know like what existed as far </v>
<v Speaker 5>as like if you could do like a core </v>

2651
01:54:49.751 --> 01:54:53.561
<v Speaker 5>sample of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can determine what the temperature </v>

2652
01:54:53.561 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the environment was like,</v>

2653
01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:59.531
<v Speaker 5>what animals and plants existed and what</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they could put all this data into a </v>

2654
01:54:59.531 --> 01:55:01.430
<v Speaker 5>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if they could put like core samples</v>

2655
01:55:01.431 --> 01:55:03.800
<v Speaker 5>and what we know about climate illogical</v>
<v Speaker 5>change on the shit,</v>

2656
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:09.010
<v Speaker 5>put it into a computer with the known </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the known animals that exist today </v>

2657
01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:14.020
<v Speaker 5>and literally run a computer program </v>
<v Speaker 5>that goes backwards and evolution and </v>

2658
01:55:14.691 --> 01:55:18.920
<v Speaker 5>takes us to what existed tens of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years ago to 100,000</v>

2659
01:55:18.921 --> 01:55:20.420
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a million years ago,</v>

2660
01:55:20.421 --> 01:55:25.421
<v Speaker 5>10 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have to account for known </v>

2661
01:55:25.421 --> 01:55:26.360
<v Speaker 5>asteroid impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>known craters,</v>

2662
01:55:26.361 --> 01:55:31.361
<v Speaker 5>known things that probably wiped out </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost everything that they're going to </v>

2663
01:55:31.361 --> 01:55:32.270
<v Speaker 5>get to a point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>computationally,</v>

2664
01:55:32.271 --> 01:55:34.130
<v Speaker 5>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technologically,</v>

2665
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.300
<v Speaker 5>where they're literally able to recreate</v>
<v Speaker 5>the past with a computer.</v>

2666
01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck son?</v>

2667
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:44.700
<v Speaker 5>What kind of crazy world we live in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A won't see it will be dead.</v>

2668
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:46.080
<v Speaker 5>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>

2669
01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that confident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might see the beginning.</v>

2670
01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going to see some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2671
01:55:49.861 --> 01:55:52.020
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you with your bloody butthole.</v>

2672
01:55:52.050 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 5>You might not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but me.</v>

2673
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:56.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to live to be a couple more </v>
<v Speaker 5>decades for sure.</v>

2674
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.770
<v Speaker 5>I've got a few decades semester still on</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 62 years old.</v>

2675
01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:03.030
<v Speaker 5>It looks like he's a fucking stud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he's alive,</v>

2676
01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:05.240
<v Speaker 5>he's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to last till next poet.</v>

2677
01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When do you think when you think you're </v>

2678
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 5>going to go Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sunday,</v>

2679
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.530
<v Speaker 5>don't say that I'm going to miss you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't die to be reborn in your new </v>

2680
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.530
<v Speaker 5>child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

2681
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 5>that's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really creepy.</v>

2682
01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:19.600
<v Speaker 5>Cause I'm about to have a new child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know it.</v>

2683
01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 5>Brian died tomorrow.</v>

2684
01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.800
<v Speaker 5>Then my daughter woke up or came out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Pussy and looked at me and was like,</v>

2685
01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:32.180
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got with me at a strip club and </v>

2686
01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.210
<v Speaker 5>started saying things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian says like first words like shit.</v>

2687
01:56:33.211 --> 01:56:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Brian says all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We find a way to do it.</v>

2688
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 5>Don't come back as my child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be just rude.</v>

2689
01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Very rude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let my wife soccer sucking on my wife's </v>

2690
01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:45.480
<v Speaker 5>ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's creepy.</v>

2691
01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:50.300
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you want to come back as a </v>

2692
01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:50.300
<v Speaker 5>baby?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A baby girl.</v>

2693
01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Start this party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine just coming back as a </v>

2694
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.300
<v Speaker 5>baby girl and you have the mind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2695
01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.720
<v Speaker 5>Thirty four year old man trapped in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>baby girl that's fake dicks on Brian.</v>

2696
01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's your fake Dick Talk.</v>

2697
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:06.360
<v Speaker 5>Let's go to the chat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if there's anything interesting that</v>

2698
01:57:06.361 --> 01:57:09.260
<v Speaker 5>anybody has to say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to urinate and what's this?</v>

2699
01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:11.940
<v Speaker 5>This is what's wrong with the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's for me?</v>

2700
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:13.950
<v Speaker 5>Link.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is that guy saying?</v>

2701
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:19.320
<v Speaker 5>If you survive the next 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could possibly immortal through cell</v>

2702
01:57:19.321 --> 01:57:20.580
<v Speaker 5>regeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:57:20.581 --> 01:57:23.940
<v Speaker 5>That is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or it might even be weirder.</v>

2704
01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:29.180
<v Speaker 5>What the Ray Crets we'll idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be able to download </v>

2705
01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:31.950
<v Speaker 5>consciousness into a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very possible idea.</v>

2706
01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:37.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they can figure out a way to make </v>

2707
01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:38.730
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a reproduction of the human</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind,</v>

2708
01:57:39.010 --> 01:57:44.010
<v Speaker 5>like like some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a computer that actually </v>

2709
01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:46.941
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a software or a hardware </v>
<v Speaker 5>issue where you reproduce all the </v>

2710
01:57:46.941 --> 01:57:50.691
<v Speaker 5>functions of a human brain and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another download </v>

2711
01:57:50.691 --> 01:57:55.071
<v Speaker 5>consciousness into that computer and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could use that and replicate it and you </v>

2712
01:57:55.171 --> 01:58:00.171
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could like literally exist in a </v>

2713
01:58:00.171 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 5>bunch of different fucking computers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be very strange if it was all</v>

2714
01:58:01.771 --> 01:58:06.771
<v Speaker 5>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like say if you downloaded your </v>

2715
01:58:06.771 --> 01:58:08.691
<v Speaker 5>consciousness into computers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but your consciousness was still </v>

2716
01:58:08.691 --> 01:58:10.160
<v Speaker 5>attached to those computers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so instead of you know,</v>

2717
01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:15.340
<v Speaker 5>you being able to live a different life </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside this computer would if like that </v>

2718
01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:19.611
<v Speaker 5>life is going on at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can echo in your head and everything </v>

2719
01:58:19.611 --> 01:58:23.331
<v Speaker 5>you do is like doubled and tripled and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you go fucking crazy because </v>

2720
01:58:23.331 --> 01:58:27.381
<v Speaker 5>your consciousness isn't a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different computers and all these </v>

2721
01:58:27.381 --> 01:58:27.381
<v Speaker 5>different things are going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same time,</v>

2722
01:58:27.381 --> 01:58:31.131
<v Speaker 5>but it's all inside your head and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't fucking get away and you ruined </v>

2723
01:58:31.131 --> 01:58:31.131
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2724
01:58:31.131 --> 01:58:34.130
<v Speaker 5>So you gotta find the computers that </v>
<v Speaker 5>have your consciousness in it and </v>

2725
01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:36.531
<v Speaker 5>fucking killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to stop the madness in your head </v>

2726
01:58:36.531 --> 01:58:39.651
<v Speaker 5>because there's a fucking crazy echo </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're living a thousand </v>

2727
01:58:39.651 --> 01:58:40.680
<v Speaker 5>different lives all at once inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking computers.</v>

2728
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 5>I didn't smell</v>

2729
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.690
<v Speaker 4>like pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot to take a shower this morning.</v>

2730
01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:46.720
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is awesome.</v>

2731
01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:48.180
<v Speaker 4>How bad is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2732
01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 4>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that she's not supposed to.</v>

2733
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:54.150
<v Speaker 4>It's pussies to smells none or awful and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not supposed to smell,</v>

2734
01:58:54.170 --> 01:58:57.040
<v Speaker 4>but just that slight pussy where you had</v>
<v Speaker 4>slight pussy.</v>

2735
01:58:57.041 --> 01:59:02.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're thinking that it's just </v>

2736
01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:02.041
<v Speaker 4>like pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really it's your dead loads.</v>

2737
01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:06.450
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're getting all excited </v>

2738
01:59:06.450 --> 01:59:06.450
<v Speaker 4>smelling your own loads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

2739
01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:09.280
<v Speaker 4>It's your own loeser trapped in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwear.</v>

2740
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 4>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what it is,</v>

2741
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:13.020
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably my butthole smell</v>

2743
01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2744
01:59:22.001 --> 01:59:24.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never going to answer.</v>

2745
01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:26.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who the fuck is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>win.</v>

2746
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2747
01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:32.640
<v Speaker 5>That's the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing a comedy when I'm coming </v>

2748
01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:33.640
<v Speaker 5>to Vancouver this time because I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to do the Red Robinson theater,</v>

2749
01:59:33.641 --> 01:59:36.150
<v Speaker 5>but apparently they have some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2750
01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:41.160
<v Speaker 5>a corporate thing that they booked out </v>
<v Speaker 5>for three days in a row and they can't </v>

2751
01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:44.551
<v Speaker 5>cancel it and that's the only time I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be there and they didn't want </v>

2752
01:59:44.551 --> 01:59:45.190
<v Speaker 5>me doing another club because I always </v>
<v Speaker 5>do their club.</v>

2753
01:59:45.191 --> 01:59:47.710
<v Speaker 5>I sort of have an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's a big theater.</v>

2754
01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:53.400
<v Speaker 5>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this time I'm not going to be doing </v>

<v Speaker 5>fate or last?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay fellow.</v>

2771
02:00:28.610 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of bad questions here in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>trap.</v>

2772
02:00:32.130 --> 02:00:35.570
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what Mark Emery is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] you know that guy's there.</v>

2773
02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:40.640
<v Speaker 5>Extraditing him or have extra added him </v>
<v Speaker 5>to America or just to spend five years </v>

2774
02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:43.320
<v Speaker 5>in jail for selling seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seeds that make people happy.</v>

2775
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:45.750
<v Speaker 5>Pot seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile his own country.</v>

2776
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:47.430
<v Speaker 5>Not only the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not prosecuting him,</v>

2777
02:00:47.431 --> 02:00:49.920
<v Speaker 5>he was roaming the streets free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2778
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:54.980
<v Speaker 5>he was fine and his own country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was fine and there extraditing him </v>

2779
02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:59.061
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're saying he's responsible for </v>

2780
02:00:59.061 --> 02:00:59.061
<v Speaker 5>millions dollars of sales of seeds here </v>
<v Speaker 5>in America and you know,</v>

2781
02:00:59.061 --> 02:01:01.720
<v Speaker 5>I ran a drug empire by selling</v>

2782
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:02.550
<v Speaker 4>seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2783
02:01:02.551 --> 02:01:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up.</v>

2784
02:01:03.981 --> 02:01:08.981
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel bad about because that's </v>

2785
02:01:08.981 --> 02:01:08.981
<v Speaker 4>the risk you take when you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2786
02:01:08.981 --> 02:01:10.490
<v Speaker 4>Like selling seeds and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2787
02:01:10.810 --> 02:01:12.680
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I feel bad,</v>

2788
02:01:12.681 --> 02:01:15.290
<v Speaker 4>but I also like if I was selling </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana seeds,</v>

2789
02:01:15.291 --> 02:01:20.291
<v Speaker 4>I would know that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a slight chance that I could be </v>

2790
02:01:20.291 --> 02:01:23.051
<v Speaker 4>fucked somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in his country that is not in his </v>

2791
02:01:23.051 --> 02:01:23.051
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally legal.</v>

2792
02:01:23.051 --> 02:01:23.420
<v Speaker 4>The problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was shipping them to America.</v>

2793
02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:26.210
<v Speaker 4>If he never shipped them to America and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just sold them in Canada,</v>

2794
02:01:26.211 --> 02:01:28.100
<v Speaker 4>he'd be gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like he's dumb for Canada.</v>

2795
02:01:28.101 --> 02:01:33.101
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they do when they have to deal </v>

2796
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:33.101
<v Speaker 4>with shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is like,</v>

2797
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:35.270
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's not really legal in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vancouver,</v>

2798
02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:37.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they tolerate it,</v>

2799
02:01:37.911 --> 02:01:39.080
<v Speaker 4>they just let it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let it happen.</v>

2800
02:01:39.110 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Dad smoke shops</v>

2801
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 5>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like answer them up there,</v>

2802
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:46.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you could just go and smoke weed </v>

2803
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:48.371
<v Speaker 5>and this motherfucker was just out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the open with it and selling seeds to </v>

2804
02:01:48.371 --> 02:01:50.390
<v Speaker 5>America and now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're extraditing him.</v>

2805
02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:53.180
<v Speaker 5>He's gonna have to do five years in jail</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's not a young man.</v>

2806
02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:58.210
<v Speaker 5>That's a long ass fucking time to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>locked in a cage for a plant that makes </v>

2807
02:01:58.210 --> 02:01:58.340
<v Speaker 5>you a silly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2808
02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.640
<v Speaker 5>the fact that that's still even debated </v>
<v Speaker 5>in 2010 that would be wasting any </v>

2809
02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:06.530
<v Speaker 5>resources at all processing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>prosecuting anyone for pot.</v>

2810
02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 5>It mean even a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you know they're saying he broke</v>

2811
02:02:09.261 --> 02:02:12.110
<v Speaker 5>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what the thought is fucking stupid.</v>

2812
02:02:12.111 --> 02:02:14.390
<v Speaker 5>It's a dumb fucking law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The law is stupid.</v>

2813
02:02:14.391 --> 02:02:16.430
<v Speaker 5>But he knew what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what?</v>

2814
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.530
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter the laws.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dumb.</v>

2815
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:19.920
<v Speaker 5>Well then do it.</v>

2816
02:02:20.110 --> 02:02:21.080
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

2817
02:02:21.081 --> 02:02:26.081
<v Speaker 5>he should be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know you shouldn't be able to put a guy </v>

2818
02:02:26.081 --> 02:02:26.081
<v Speaker 5>in jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

2819
02:02:26.081 --> 02:02:29.600
<v Speaker 5>That in 2010 we got so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>discrepancies,</v>

2820
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 5>so many fucked up hypocritical </v>
<v Speaker 5>situations in our culture.</v>

2821
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:37.810
<v Speaker 5>How about gambling?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about the fact that dudes are </v>

2822
02:02:37.810 --> 02:02:37.810
<v Speaker 5>getting busted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having poker games,</v>

2823
02:02:37.810 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 5>you know that people are getting busted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're breaking open private poker</v>

2824
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:43.220
<v Speaker 5>games and cops are coming and taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>money and shed.</v>

2825
02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.520
<v Speaker 5>I've read a bunch of stories about shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this happening where people are </v>

2826
02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 5>getting in trouble for gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing poker with their own money.</v>

2827
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:52.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to go to these God damn Indian.</v>

2828
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Not that there's anything wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any casino,</v>

2829
02:02:54.710 --> 02:02:56.780
<v Speaker 5>but you have to go to Indian casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't have one.</v>

2830
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:59.220
<v Speaker 5>You can have a casino like down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street from your house.</v>

2831
02:02:59.590 --> 02:03:01.970
<v Speaker 5>It has to be in certain places and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only place,</v>

2832
02:03:01.971 --> 02:03:03.320
<v Speaker 5>certain games in them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2833
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:08.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>California and was bellflower and </v>

2834
02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:11.681
<v Speaker 5>there's a few in most parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country it's very difficult to find </v>

2835
02:03:11.681 --> 02:03:13.040
<v Speaker 5>casinos and you can't play poker online </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's illegal.</v>

2836
02:03:13.130 --> 02:03:18.130
<v Speaker 5>So if you want to play online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to go through like a third </v>

2837
02:03:18.130 --> 02:03:19.160
<v Speaker 5>party and it's like you have to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>send your money into someplace.</v>

2838
02:03:19.161 --> 02:03:24.161
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking all cryptic and weird and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what the fuck is </v>

2839
02:03:24.161 --> 02:03:24.161
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's all probably illegal anyway.</v>

2840
02:03:24.161 --> 02:03:25.810
<v Speaker 5>If you got in trouble for doing it the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way you're doing it,</v>

2841
02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:30.860
<v Speaker 5>even if you do it through a third party,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could probably get some sort of a </v>

2842
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.880
<v Speaker 5>fine or something for it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes,</v>

<v Speaker 5>strippers have to pay taxes.</v>

2902
02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:43.840
<v Speaker 5>They're not always right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2903
02:05:43.841 --> 02:05:48.841
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just make people fucking make them </v>

2906
02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:55.330

<v Speaker 5>especially if you're in a 48 percent tax</v>

2907
02:05:55.331 --> 02:05:55.780
<v Speaker 5>bracket.</v>

2909
02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:58.900
<v Speaker 5>The government should never get half of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your money.</v>

2910
02:05:58.901 --> 02:06:01.480
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You make 100 bucks,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you've got to protect yourself and set </v>

2913
02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:11.050

<v Speaker 6>What you did it because you use one of </v>

<v Speaker 6>those programs and you tried to take a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of different things on turbo tax and</v>

02:06:40.051 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 6>then I used a home office and Blah Blah </v>
<v Speaker 6>Blah.</v>

2925
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:47.100
<v Speaker 6>And they just don't like it when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a Home Office.</v>

2926
02:06:47.101 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 6>I guess they don't like it when you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of exemptions.</v>

2927
02:06:49.621 --> 02:06:51.450
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I would like right off,</v>

2928
02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2929
02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:55.700
<v Speaker 6>like electricity right off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like gas and you know,</v>

2930
02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:58.470
<v Speaker 6>driving because it's a home office and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that,</v>

2931
02:06:58.471 --> 02:07:03.471
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or whenever I buy batteries and stupid </v>

2932
02:07:03.471 --> 02:07:03.471
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2933
02:07:03.471 --> 02:07:05.100
<v Speaker 6>I thought Mike because I buy everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>online.</v>

2934
02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:10.130
<v Speaker 6>So what I was thinking is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh I have receipts for everything </v>

2935
02:07:10.130 --> 02:07:10.130
<v Speaker 6>because I use credit cards and I buy </v>
<v Speaker 6>online.</v>

2936
02:07:10.130 --> 02:07:13.620
<v Speaker 6>Well Visa and mastercard and all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys decided to hey,</v>

2937
02:07:13.621 --> 02:07:17.490
<v Speaker 6>we're not going to save all your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're only saved the last year.</v>

2938
02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:20.250
<v Speaker 6>So they changed it where it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you'd have,</v>

2939
02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:25.280
<v Speaker 6>you could go back back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was able to go back like three years </v>

2940
02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:25.470
<v Speaker 6>and check out my statements like three </v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago,</v>

2941
02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:27.390
<v Speaker 6>but they stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now it's only one year.</v>

2942
02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:31.440
<v Speaker 6>So I just lost like all my receipts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then when they never kept anything in</v>

2943
02:07:31.441 --> 02:07:32.910
<v Speaker 6>hard for them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything was online.</v>

2944
02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:34.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I got kind of got fucked by that.</v>

2945
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if they did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're</v>

2946
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:37.380
<v Speaker 5>in cahoots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2947
02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:41.110
<v Speaker 5>What if the IRS tax rates contacts?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mastercard says,</v>

2948
02:07:41.111 --> 02:07:42.810
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to keep that shit right.</v>

2949
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 5>Twelve years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 months,</v>

2950

<v Speaker 5>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

2951
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:47.950
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the whole shit for 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 years.</v>

2952
02:07:47.951 --> 02:07:49.480
<v Speaker 5>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should have.</v>

2953
02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.490

<v Speaker 5>It's not your responsibility.</v>

2954

<v Speaker 5>America.</v>

2959
02:08:00.351 --> 02:08:01.240
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Twelve kilobyte file.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't the fuck you fucking in bed.</v>

2961
02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:12.020
<v Speaker 5>The irs in itself is supposedly illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these wacky people that don't think </v>

2962
02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:16.090
<v Speaker 5>you should pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the fuck does the money go?</v>

2963
02:08:16.091 --> 02:08:18.040
<v Speaker 5>That's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you really look at taxes,</v>

2964
02:08:18.041 --> 02:08:19.390
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no receipt.</v>

2965
02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:21.220
<v Speaker 5>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey Mr Johnson,</v>

2966
02:08:21.221 --> 02:08:26.221
<v Speaker 5>you spent $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>in taxes this year and this is what we </v>

2967
02:08:26.221 --> 02:08:26.221
<v Speaker 5>did with your money.</v>

2968
02:08:26.221 --> 02:08:30.600
<v Speaker 5>We spent x amount on your local middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>school and x amount on this and you </v>

2969
02:08:31.781 --> 02:08:33.250
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>x amount went to that.</v>

2970
02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:34.870
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get a fucking receipt.</v>

2971
02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:36.760
<v Speaker 5>They're not accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

2972
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:39.700
<v Speaker 5>That's why when you hear about like </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy no bid,</v>

2973
02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:44.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>contracts and you know that they're in </v>

2974
02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.611
<v Speaker 5>bed with these fucking Halliburton and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different companies that are </v>

2975
02:08:47.611 --> 02:08:51.900
<v Speaker 5>getting these crazy fucking contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then in money winds up missing and it's </v>

2976
02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:54.240
<v Speaker 5>like well they can't account for </v>
<v Speaker 5>billions of dollars and it's.</v>

2977
02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:59.370
<v Speaker 5>This is mad cluster fuck of money and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>big grab like who is stealing when it </v>

2978
02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:03.400
<v Speaker 5>comes to this bank thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole bank bailout thing.</v>

2979
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:06.880
<v Speaker 5>When you look at the money and they talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>about $700,</v>

2980
02:09:06.881 --> 02:09:11.881
<v Speaker 5>billion dollars and all this money </v>
<v Speaker 5>flying left and right and people still </v>

2981
02:09:11.881 --> 02:09:13.160
<v Speaker 5>getting bonuses and is there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it really a.</v>

2982
02:09:13.190 --> 02:09:15.220
<v Speaker 5>They have an accounting system for all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2983
02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:20.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we really tell like where your tax </v>

2984
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:20.440
<v Speaker 5>dollars went to this bailout and how it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was used?</v>

2985
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:23.320
<v Speaker 5>They don't even have to fucking tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even have to tell you,</v>

2986
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:26.920
<v Speaker 5>but yet if you file a tax report,</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker,</v>

2987
02:09:26.921 --> 02:09:31.921
<v Speaker 5>you better have receipts for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You better have receipts for every God </v>

2988
02:09:31.921 --> 02:09:33.610
<v Speaker 5>damn thing you want an exemption for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you ask them like,</v>

2989
02:09:33.611 --> 02:09:35.350
<v Speaker 5>what did you do with all my tax dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you,</v>

2990
02:09:35.351 --> 02:09:35.630
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2991
02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:38.350
<v Speaker 5>you used it to get these bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

2992
02:09:38.351 --> 02:09:40.960
<v Speaker 5>These bankers set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know that they were shorting that</v>

2993
02:09:40.961 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 5>we're making sure that they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>protected on both ends.</v>

2994
02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:48.660
<v Speaker 5>There were selling clients a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>stock and then gambling that that stock </v>

2995
02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:52.411
<v Speaker 5>was going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should probably not talk about the </v>

2996
02:09:52.411 --> 02:09:52.411
<v Speaker 5>irs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should probably be quite right.</v>

2997
02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:57.690
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Duncan trussell to gave me the best </v>

2998
02:09:57.690 --> 02:09:57.690
<v Speaker 5>advice.</v>

2999
02:09:57.690 --> 02:10:00.370
<v Speaker 5>Don't talk about the look of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about the whole system,</v>

3000
02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:01.540
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3002
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:08.310
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's incredible that it's set up that </v>

3003
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.590
<v Speaker 5>way and that politicians don't do a </v>
<v Speaker 5>goddamn thing to change it.</v>

3004
02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Obama was swearing before he got into </v>
<v Speaker 5>office that he was going to end no bid </v>

3005
02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.570
<v Speaker 5>contracts and it just gave the former </v>
<v Speaker 5>company known as Halliburton.</v>

3006
02:10:16.571 --> 02:10:18.160
<v Speaker 5>I guess they changed their name to </v>
<v Speaker 5>something else,</v>

3007
02:10:18.161 --> 02:10:20.470
<v Speaker 5>but he just gave them some $500,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million dollar.</v>

3008
02:10:20.471 --> 02:10:22.330
<v Speaker 5>No bid deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly what he said.</v>

<v Speaker 5>hours and 10 minutes Joe.</v>

3110
02:15:17.361 --> 02:15:20.871
<v Speaker 5>cigarette thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I had a cigarette thing and I was </v>

02:18:44.331 --> 02:18:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five point.</v>

3185
02:18:45.690 --> 02:18:47.720
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the cow.</v>

3186
02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:49.920
<v Speaker 4>Is that California Nevada fault line?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3187
02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:51.720
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where I was telling you last time.</v>

3188
02:18:51.721 --> 02:18:53.790
<v Speaker 4>How is your million?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at all these earthquakes,</v>

3189
02:18:53.791 --> 02:18:56.520
<v Speaker 4>so don't move to San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>San Diego.</v>

3190
02:18:56.550 --> 02:18:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is pretty nutty.</v>

3191
02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.240
<v Speaker 4>They say the Pacific northwest is due </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

3192
02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:02.330
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about that in some.</v>

3193
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:06.630
<v Speaker 5>I read about Oregon that Oregon's due </v>
<v Speaker 5>for another fucking gigantic blast.</v>

3194
02:19:06.631 --> 02:19:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a fucking hole in the universe.</v>

3195
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:11.100
<v Speaker 5>The universe is populated with visible </v>
<v Speaker 5>stars,</v>

3196
02:19:11.101 --> 02:19:16.101
<v Speaker 5>gas and dust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most of the matter in the universe </v>

3197
02:19:16.101 --> 02:19:18.891
<v Speaker 5>is invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scientists know something is there </v>

3198
02:19:18.891 --> 02:19:21.200
<v Speaker 5>because they can measure the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gravitational effects of the so called </v>

3199
02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:21.210
<v Speaker 5>dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Voids exists,</v>

3200
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:23.640
<v Speaker 5>but they're typically relatively small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3201
02:19:23.641 --> 02:19:28.641
<v Speaker 5>this fucking voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Gargantuan whole was by examining </v>

3202
02:19:28.641 --> 02:19:31.280
<v Speaker 5>observations made by using the very </v>
<v Speaker 5>large array,</v>

3203
02:19:31.281 --> 02:19:36.281
<v Speaker 5>the Vla telescope in Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>funded by the National Science </v>

3204
02:19:36.281 --> 02:19:36.281
<v Speaker 5>Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3205
02:19:36.281 --> 02:19:37.790
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some shit out there folks.</v>

3206
02:19:37.791 --> 02:19:42.650
<v Speaker 5>There's so much more shit out there than</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have mapped out and understand.</v>

3207
02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the reasons why we tune into</v>

3208
02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the reasons why we're </v>

3209
02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:51.710
<v Speaker 5>fascinated by who tiger woods is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the universe itself is too scary</v>

3210
02:19:51.711 --> 02:19:55.100
<v Speaker 5>and too much of a gigantic reminder that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we ain't shit.</v>

3211
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:57.290
<v Speaker 5>And with that note,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3212
02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:59.150
<v Speaker 5>thank you very much for tuning into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>

3213
02:19:59.151 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 5>the fleshlight.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go there and buy something and fuck it.</v>

3214
02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:07.580
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's way better than your hand and I </v>

3215
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:07.580
<v Speaker 5>don't think it's that expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much are those things like 69,</v>

3216
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:08.690
<v Speaker 5>79 bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that really all it is?</v>

3217
02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:14.200
<v Speaker 5>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thinking about how much money you spend </v>

3218
02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:14.810
<v Speaker 5>on dates with girls that you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hoping that you could fuck them when you</v>

3219
02:20:14.811 --> 02:20:18.830
<v Speaker 5>could save that and use that flashlight </v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over and over again.</v>

3220
02:20:18.831 --> 02:20:21.470
<v Speaker 5>It's people who go to clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really not that hard.</v>

3221
02:20:21.471 --> 02:20:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3222
02:20:21.861 --> 02:20:24.040
<v Speaker 5>You just hook it up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put up to the faucet,</v>

3223
02:20:24.041 --> 02:20:26.660
<v Speaker 5>turned the faucet on your squirts out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>squirts out the back.</v>

3224
02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:28.310
<v Speaker 5>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not hard at all.</v>

3225
02:20:28.311 --> 02:20:32.410
<v Speaker 5>And then you get like a little squeegee </v>
<v Speaker 5>in there and ram it.</v>

3226
02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.820
<v Speaker 5>And how's the book coming?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The book is coming.</v>

3227
02:20:34.821 --> 02:20:35.610
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3228
02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3229
02:20:36.291 --> 02:20:37.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's doing very well.</v>

3230
02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.310
<v Speaker 5>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3231
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:43.130
<v Speaker 5>it's weird and it's taken a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Its takes a long time to write,</v>

3232
02:20:43.131 --> 02:20:48.131
<v Speaker 5>to actually write something out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would have been probably way easier </v>

3233
02:20:48.131 --> 02:20:48.470
<v Speaker 5>if I tried to transcribe it and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk,</v>

3234
02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:53.740
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use like maybe a dictation program or </v>

3235
02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:53.740
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think it'll be as good.</v>

3236
02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:55.970
<v Speaker 5>I think it's better to the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a slow process to write things out.</v>

3237
02:20:55.971 --> 02:21:00.971
<v Speaker 5>But when you do just write things out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're forced to edit them and you're </v>

3238
02:21:00.971 --> 02:21:00.971
<v Speaker 5>forced to like go over them again and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see the.</v>

3239
02:21:00.971 --> 02:21:03.410
<v Speaker 5>Like the poetry of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of each sentence.</v>

3240
02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:05.600
<v Speaker 5>It's much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much better for reading.</v>

3241
02:21:05.601 --> 02:21:08.840
<v Speaker 5>I think if you actually write it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you actually just talk it,</v>

3242
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:10.200
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3243
02:21:10.201 --> 02:21:10.790
<v Speaker 5>you're going to.</v>

3244
02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:13.730
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to be as smooth as if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've reviewed it.</v>

3245
02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.870
<v Speaker 5>It won't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Its due in October.</v>

3246
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.900
<v Speaker 5>That's when it's due.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes a long time to these fucking </v>

3247
02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:22.900
<v Speaker 5>things a lot longer than I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blogs are easy,</v>

3248
02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:24.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I blog put a blog up the most,</v>

3249
02:21:24.351 --> 02:21:26.330
<v Speaker 5>it's like 2000 words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a giant one,</v>

3250
02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:28.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that takes like six or seven hours,</v>

3251
02:21:28.431 --> 02:21:31.340
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 5>paying me to do it.</v>

3252
02:21:31.341 --> 02:21:32.870
<v Speaker 5>So it's like I try,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do my best,</v>

3253
02:21:32.871 --> 02:21:34.550
<v Speaker 5>I do what I think it is and I throw it </v>
<v Speaker 5>up there.</v>

3254
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:35.510
<v Speaker 5>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this,</v>

3255
02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:37.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to put more attention and </v>
<v Speaker 5>focus to.</v>

3256
02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:39.380
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
