<v Speaker 1>you either had to hire someone who really knows how to code and do a website or</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ting is,</v>

84
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm a cell phone company that uses the sprint backbone.</v>

85
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>They have the same service that sprint has as far as uh,</v>

86
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>the signal strength and all that jazz.</v>

87
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>But the way they have it set up,</v>

88
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>they have no contracts.</v>

89
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have a contract and you buy your phone.</v>

90
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you decide like,</v>

92
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you can just quit and cancel it.</v>

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

94
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>you move on and you're,</v>

95
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you're not connected</v>

96
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 3>to them anymore.</v>

97
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 3>They have the highest level,</v>

98
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

99
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 3>android phones,</v>

100
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.410
<v Speaker 3>including the Samsung Galaxy note to which is this beastly phone that I,</v>

101
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I have some fucking free time getting one of those.</v>

102
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 4>I use Tang like a mother fucker in Vancouver this weekend.</v>

103
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 4>What's funny is because I had the a t and t uh,</v>

104
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 4>iPhone and the galaxy s three on Ting and my iPhone,</v>

105
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

106
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 4>my calling plans and everything,</v>

107
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.031
<v Speaker 4>how it was set up,</v>

108
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 4>it would have cost me every time I downloaded a photo,</v>

109
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 4>it would probably cost me about $60.</v>

110
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Because you were terrified to use your phone.</v>

111
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.683
<v Speaker 3>What's funny is</v>

124
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 4>using it for brief amounts of time,</v>

125
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 4>I got like two emails from at and t saying you've already gone over a hundred</v>

126
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.843
<v Speaker 4>dollars in data.</v>

129
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 3>When you sit down and you're sitting at a bar and you're like,</v>

130
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:01.971

135
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

136
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

137
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 3>You could definitely blow your wad when you're in a foreign country and you</v>

138
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:11.901
<v Speaker 3>using cell phone,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

140
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 4>And what's cool is ting has a page and see if I can find it for you.</v>

141
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 4>That it just shows you what,</v>

145
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 4>this is how much it will cost to check your email.</v>

146
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.300

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

209
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 4>It's calling another country 15 cents a minute.</v>

210
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.731
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

211
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

212
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 4>but it just kind of show you what the differences is.</v>

213
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.580
<v Speaker 4>I use both phones in Canada and I bet you my bill on at and t is at least $400 I</v>

<v Speaker 5>I bet you're right.</v>

217
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.923
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're right.</v>

218
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

219
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>the what tings idea was when,</v>

220
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.830
<v Speaker 1>when they first created their company,</v>

221
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.570
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to have,</v>

222
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

223
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.490
<v Speaker 1>an ethical cell phone company.</v>

224
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.390
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of like,</v>

225
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be their motto.</v>

226
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.680
<v Speaker 1>They want to have cell phones that,</v>

227
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.670
<v Speaker 1>you know are like,</v>

228
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not sacrificing the quality of the device or the quality of the service,</v>

229
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.440
<v Speaker 1>but instead of getting locked into some stupid ass contract,</v>

230
00:06:26.441 --> 00:06:27.700
<v Speaker 1>it kind of feels gross.</v>

231
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.661
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>

232
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:29.500
<v Speaker 1>You leave whenever you want.</v>

233
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.350
<v Speaker 1>They also credit you on unused minutes.</v>

234
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.170
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful if you use more or less,</v>

235
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:37.060
<v Speaker 1>rather if you use less than you,</v>

236
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237

238
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.710
<v Speaker 1>they knock you down to the lower level and they credit you the difference on</v>

239
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:42.544
<v Speaker 1>your next bill.</v>

240
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.821
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

241
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:44.410
<v Speaker 1>no one's trying to rip you off.</v>

242
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.460
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to give you really good cell for cell phone service at a</v>

243
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>reasonable rate and everybody can be happy instead of being greedy.</v>

244
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Twats everybody literally can be happy.</v>

245

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 5>You know what's crazy is if they had put this in during lunch,</v>

294
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow land and Disney world and they had said it,</v>

295
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 5>it probably wouldn't impress that many people.</v>

296
00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:17.640
<v Speaker 5>But like a jet pack impresses people.</v>

297
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

298
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.260
<v Speaker 5>But this is so next level.</v>

299
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so next level.</v>

300
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:20.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

301
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:22.770
<v Speaker 1>back when I had a t one line in my house,</v>

302
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

303
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I had that Brian when I was a quake player.</v>

304
00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.070
<v Speaker 1>That was the only 1.5 megs.</v>

306
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 1>That shit was nothing.</v>

307
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a whack of dishes you can comparison to now me back down,</v>

308
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I was a goddamn superstar.</v>

309
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 1>You know you've got a t one line,</v>

310
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what a t one line is.</v>

311
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a fat business internet pipe,</v>

312
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing compared to like Verizon fiber optics.</v>

313
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

314
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

315
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.781
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

316
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:50.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean not even fucking close like these time Warner cable packages we can get</v>

317
00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:55.420

318
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>They're insane</v>

319
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 6>now you know,</v>

320
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 6>you can get like really powerful Internet that makes a t one line like I had</v>

321
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 6>from like 1998 or something like that.</v>

322
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 6>It makes a t one line looked like a piece of shit.</v>

323
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I the,</v>

324

326
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.930

327
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 2>And so until they upgrade.</v>

328
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.291

340
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have cable Internet.</v>

347
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 2>So you probably have Warner or charter or something like that.</v>

00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 3>I fucked that kind of putting these cookies.</v>

464
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

465
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 3>That Guy Brian had something and I was like,</v>

466
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:56.651
<v Speaker 3>don't eat it.</v>

467
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.041
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

468
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:57.531
<v Speaker 3>I want to eat it,</v>

469
00:12:57.531 --> 00:12:57.851
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

470
00:12:57.851 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking crazy.</v>

471
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not touching that shit.</v>

472
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 3>This guy gave me so much stuff and I was like,</v>

473
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:03.371
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

474
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm only here for seven more hours.</v>

475
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

476
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.690
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

477
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver is such a fascinating place.</v>

478
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Can go drugs like crazy Canadians.</v>

479
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 3>They're better than Americans.</v>

480
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

481
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.471
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

482
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:18.840
<v Speaker 3>They're like 20% better there.</v>

483
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>

484
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 3>younger Americans aren't cool as fuck and that the Canadians aren't Douche bags.</v>

485
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking like the overall behavior of the people is is better.</v>

486
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.240
<v Speaker 3>It's because the Chinese are robots in the house.</v>

487
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's something,</v>

488
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 3>there's so many Chinese people there that was so interesting when that,</v>

489
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

490
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 3>we should talk about this then.</v>

491
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

492
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 3>That's not why they're so nice.</v>

493
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 3>China's not necessarily known for being nice and I guess you answered my</v>

494
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:43.420
<v Speaker 3>question of who was fucking first.</v>

495
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

496
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 3>we need to talk about Vancouver because I noticed so much stuff.</v>

497
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I've researched that shit.</v>

498
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver is amazing.</v>

499
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

500
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.020
<v Speaker 1>where were we?</v>

501
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Stamp Talk Com.</v>

502
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Go fuck yourself like yourself,</v>

503
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.483
<v Speaker 1>Jay already.</v>

504
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Codeword J R II.</v>

505
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.850
<v Speaker 1>That's how you save some money.</v>

506
00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:56.690
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome product.</v>

507
00:13:56.691 --> 00:13:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

508
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.680
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

509
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.910
<v Speaker 1>it is a product that um,</v>

510
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Brian actually uses so we can talk about it.</v>

511
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.170
<v Speaker 1>All the shit that we talk about in the podcast,</v>

512
00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:07.010
<v Speaker 1>we try,</v>

513
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.500
<v Speaker 1>when we have commercials we try to make,</v>

514
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've heard it a million times from me before,</v>

515
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.501
<v Speaker 1>listen all the time,</v>

516
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but we try to make sure that nothing we're selling isn't anything that</v>

517
00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:17.900
<v Speaker 1>everything we're selling rather,</v>

518
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:18.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

519
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.580
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we would use.</v>

520
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Nothing we're selling is embarrassing.</v>

521
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Nothing we're selling is just bullshit that you're selling just to make money.</v>

522
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.790
<v Speaker 1>And that goes with a on it.</v>

523
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I smoked too much pot before the show my throat,</v>

524
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even that.</v>

525
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:35.624
<v Speaker 1>It's my throat.</v>

526
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It's very unprofessional,</v>

527
00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:39.104
<v Speaker 1>these gentlemen.</v>

528
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.283
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

529
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

530
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.460
<v Speaker 1>on a.com if you haven't been there for awhile,</v>

531
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.490
<v Speaker 1>we added a bunch of different foods,</v>

532
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.090
<v Speaker 1>like a buffalo bars and now we have hemp force bars,</v>

533
00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:51.110
<v Speaker 1>hemp protein bars,</v>

534
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

535
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.510
<v Speaker 6>delicious and their dance,</v>

536
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 6>these little fucking things.</v>

537
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 6>If you want something to fill you up if you're in between,</v>

538
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 6>that's what I use him for most of the time.</v>

539
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 6>Honestly.</v>

540
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.210
<v Speaker 6>I use him for like if I'm on the golf,</v>

541
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 6>I'm like traveling or something.</v>

542
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 6>Instead of eating a cheeseburger,</v>

543
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 6>I'll eat a cup of those hemp protein bars.</v>

544
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 6>They're little tiny bars and I'm good.</v>

545
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 6>They're just such dense protein.</v>

546
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.271
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

547
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:14.780
<v Speaker 6>we also sell like Blendtec blenders to make smoothies with.</v>

548
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 6>We now have Wallman all almond cashew butter.</v>

549
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.270
<v Speaker 6>We have a bunch of like really healthy cool shit like Himalayan salt and killer</v>

550
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:24.104
<v Speaker 6>bee honey.</v>

551
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

552
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 6>and as well as a bunch of different fitness equipment.</v>

553
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 6>Do you guys do a bulletproof coffee?</v>

554
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.231
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

555
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:30.381
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

556
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 6>we saw that now dude,</v>

557
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 6>I just had that for the first time this morning.</v>

558
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 6>If people don't know what book proof coffee is,</v>

559
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 6>our good pal Dave Asprey,</v>

560
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.810
<v Speaker 6>who I've been going back and forth with to get him on the podcast.</v>

561
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.051
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

562
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 6>we're just trying to figure out a date that works for both of us.</v>

563
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 6>He figured out,</v>

564
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 6>or at least he told us that other people had figured out that there was</v>

565
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:54.191
<v Speaker 6>something on coffee called Mycotoxins that a lot of folks are not aware of and</v>

566
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:58.670
<v Speaker 6>they can exist if coffee isn't stored correctly.</v>

567
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 6>If it's under the wrong conditions,</v>

568
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:04.500
<v Speaker 6>if you know the crop gets infected with this fungus and that is a,</v>

569
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 6>it exists in a lot of coffee.</v>

570
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that people associate with coffee,</v>

571
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 6>like with being like there's crash and feeling like shit after it's over,</v>

572
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.920
<v Speaker 6>it may very well be that what you're getting in that experience is the effects</v>

573
00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 6>of these mycotoxins,</v>

574
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:23.170
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

575
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

576
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.970
<v Speaker 6>these fungal toxins that are on the coffee.</v>

577
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 6>So not all coffee is created equal.</v>

578
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.720
<v Speaker 6>And what Dave Asprey figured out is how to get coffee from a single source,</v>

579
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 6>meaning the people that grow it are the people that pick it or the people that,</v>

580
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.690
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

581
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 6>that cook it,</v>

582
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:38.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

583
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

584
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 6>bacon or whatever the fuck that is.</v>

585
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 6>What do they call it when they turn coffee,</v>

586
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:43.281
<v Speaker 6>they call it,</v>

587
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:43.770
<v Speaker 6>they don't roast,</v>

588
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.603
<v Speaker 6>bake it roasted.</v>

589
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.440
<v Speaker 6>And when they do it all together,</v>

590
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.030
<v Speaker 6>they control the process and they know that they don't have any of these</v>

591
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:51.080
<v Speaker 6>mycotoxins on it.</v>

592
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm still interested to wonder like what I would like to get somebody from my</v>

593
00:16:54.401 --> 00:16:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Folgers to come in here and be like fuck,</v>

594
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.600
<v Speaker 2>love the guy that I would love to hear what they say about it to hold uses the</v>

595
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:02.920
<v Speaker 2>wrong company in my opinion.</v>

596
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Like the get a guy who there's the exact same thing.</v>

597
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:06.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

598
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.511
<v Speaker 2>no but like there,</v>

599
00:17:07.511 --> 00:17:10.150
<v Speaker 2>there are coffee [inaudible] like the dudes,</v>

600
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I got a guy that worked on travel channel till you didn't even stumble with that</v>

601
00:17:13.661 --> 00:17:15.530
<v Speaker 2>work and practice that word for a reason.</v>

602
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.530
<v Speaker 2>But I'm talking about mass market.</v>

603
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Like people like if this is all true,</v>

604
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:22.780
<v Speaker 2>like somebody that delivers mass amounts of it but you don't want them cause</v>

605
00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:23.320
<v Speaker 2>they're never,</v>

606
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.131
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to be honest.</v>

607
00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Starbucks would be a great president.</v>

608
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:25.721
<v Speaker 2>Starbucks,</v>

609
00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:27.370
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to be honest with you about anything.</v>

610
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:28.480
<v Speaker 2>You're going to talk to them and they're going to go,</v>

611
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.070
<v Speaker 2>well we don't have those.</v>

612
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Microtoxins you want to talk to a guy who has no affiliation with it?</v>

613
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.431
<v Speaker 2>Not even,</v>

614
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:33.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean not,</v>

615
00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to test it.</v>

616
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.040
<v Speaker 2>It is what</v>

617
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.491
<v Speaker 6>you want to do.</v>

618
00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:36.690
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to tell it to anybody,</v>

619
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.490
<v Speaker 6>which you want to do is you want to go to Starbucks,</v>

620
00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:40.980
<v Speaker 6>you want to pick up a bag of coffee and you want to go test it.</v>

621
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

622
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.260
<v Speaker 6>Until then everyone's just talking shit.</v>

623
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.530
<v Speaker 6>So I hope Dave Asprey comes on and drop some knowledge on us.</v>

624
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.780
<v Speaker 6>But what I do know is that his his,</v>

625
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 6>which is this combination</v>

626
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>of what he calls upgraded coffee,</v>

627
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>which is single source coffee when you know it doesn't have any mycotoxins on it</v>

628
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 1>and grass fed butter along with MCT oil and he blends it up in one of those</v>

629
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Blendtec blenders and it's fucking sensational.</v>

630
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.221
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

631
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:05.851
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

632
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>If it gives you energy for like a long time.</v>

633
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:10.241
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

634
00:18:10.241 --> 00:18:15.060
<v Speaker 1>It has a much more prolonged effect because of the MCT oil apparently and the</v>

635
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:15.894
<v Speaker 1>grass fed butter,</v>

636
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>like all the richness of it.</v>

637
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a slower digesting sort of thing.</v>

638
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.770
<v Speaker 2>A tutor for the first time today and my wife,</v>

639
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.401
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

640
00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I pulled it out and I had heard it from here.</v>

641
00:18:23.691 --> 00:18:25.610
<v Speaker 2>They will come to my show in Portland and gave me a box,</v>

642
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.533
<v Speaker 2>a bag,</v>

643
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.991
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

644
00:18:26.991 --> 00:18:28.120
<v Speaker 2>fucking so pumped you.</v>

645
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.881
<v Speaker 2>I went and bought,</v>

646
00:18:28.881 --> 00:18:29.840
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a coffee maker.</v>

647
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.500
<v Speaker 2>We have that,</v>

648
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you know that?</v>

649
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Click it in the little pods.</v>

650
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

651
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I had to go buy a fucking French Press.</v>

652
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I had to grind it up kind of rough and I did it.</v>

653
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.363
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

654
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 2>and my wife and I had it.</v>

655
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I fuck him.</v>

656
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:40.791
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

657
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:41.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't eat much.</v>

658
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I fucking ate like a little bit of salmon today.</v>

659
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Some egg whites this morning.</v>

660
00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking set.</v>

661
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love that shit and I'm going to buy it.</v>

662
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

663
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.680
<v Speaker 1>it's really rich in fats with the MCT oil and with the er,</v>

664
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.800
<v Speaker 1>the grass fed butter when all that together is,</v>

665
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>is blended in with the coffee.</v>

666
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:00.691
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about it.</v>

667
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 1>That shit takes a long time to digest.</v>

668
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 1>So as is digesting,</v>

669
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 1>it's slowly releasing caffeine,</v>

670
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 1>so it's all mixed in together.</v>

672
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow roll instead of just the coffee by itself.</v>

673
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.870
<v Speaker 1>At least this is the theory behind it.</v>

674
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.841
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

675
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 1>it does have an effect.</v>

676
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.910
<v Speaker 2>They're feeding beef.</v>

677
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.650
<v Speaker 2>They're feeding cows.</v>

678
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

679
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.010
<v Speaker 2>the same Omega threes that are in Salmon,</v>

680
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.370
<v Speaker 2>so now meet will have the exact same effect that salmon has on you.</v>

681
00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

682
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.220
<v Speaker 2>My wife just told me it's like coming out in like two weeks.</v>

684
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.410
<v Speaker 1>That's not good for fish because they're already on shaky ground for pork farm</v>

685
00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:36.260
<v Speaker 1>raised salmon,</v>

686
00:19:36.261 --> 00:19:39.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking looking fucking lizards have the sea creeps.</v>

687
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.720
<v Speaker 1>All creeps.</v>

688
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

689
00:19:42.701 --> 00:19:44.540
<v Speaker 1>of the things I realized when I started fishing,</v>

690
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

691
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I used to love fishing,</v>

692
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.930
<v Speaker 1>but when I would go fishing for Bass and they would sell bass lures,</v>

693
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.311
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

694
00:19:52.311 --> 00:19:52.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

695
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:53.294
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

696
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.570
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be like a bass fingerling like right out of the mother's</v>

697
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:57.404
<v Speaker 1>womb.</v>

698
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>So because,</v>

699
00:19:58.371 --> 00:19:58.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

700
00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.364
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

701
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.010
<v Speaker 1>they have eggs and I'll have a womb,</v>

702
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:03.860
<v Speaker 1>they just ship the acts and the dude comes on it and then they leave the little</v>

704
00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:04.700
<v Speaker 1>fuckers on their own.</v>

705
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.370
<v Speaker 1>But the male basketball oftentimes eat them.</v>

706
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

707
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be great if women did that if like they did to eight,</v>

708
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.913
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's baggies?</v>

709
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.091
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

710
00:20:11.091 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 1>they leave their eggs in the side of a bar and then in order to have it,</v>

711
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.301
<v Speaker 2>maybe I have to go,</v>

712
00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:15.134
<v Speaker 2>come on it.</v>

713
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:15.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

714
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.310
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

715
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.080
<v Speaker 2>But then you could fuck them all you want and you don't have to worry about</v>

716
00:20:18.081 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 2>getting pregnant.</v>

717
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 1>The only time that works,</v>

718
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why they do that is when where you live is so bad.</v>

719
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes Detroit look like the,</v>

720
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.200
<v Speaker 1>the cushiest fucking spot on earth say you,</v>

721
00:20:29.201 --> 00:20:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

747
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.950
<v Speaker 1>but I mean a lot of animals eat their own placenta.</v>

748
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.211
<v Speaker 1>A lot of animals,</v>

755
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 1>but that was one of the things they rejected.</v>

756
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 1>They said no to placenta.</v>

757

910
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a few in the history of the podcast that tried to get high with us and</v>

911
00:25:01.471 --> 00:25:03.630
<v Speaker 1>then just the whole podcast went into a tank.</v>

912
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It just spiraled out of control.</v>

00:27:27.401 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1016
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1017
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1018
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.990
<v Speaker 2>like it was different and it was a cool to do something different.</v>

1019
00:27:31.991 --> 00:27:32.501
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1020
00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:32.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1021
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.400
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>

1022
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm always gonna try to throw something interesting in there.</v>

1023
00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I love sitting and talking with dudes,</v>

1024
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.600
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's like,</v>

1025
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.180
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm not that great of an interviewer.</v>

1027
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I like talking over people.</v>

1028
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.860
<v Speaker 6>That's a common one that takes a while to figure out how to manage and it's</v>

1029
00:27:47.861 --> 00:27:48.694
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1030
00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.621
<v Speaker 6>it's hard because you,</v>

1031
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:50.260
<v Speaker 6>you got to,</v>

1032
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.580
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to both listen and think about what you're going to say as well.</v>

1033
00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.653
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1034
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1035
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.480
<v Speaker 6>that's the issue with people talking over people is they just can't hold onto</v>

1036
00:27:59.530 --> 00:27:59.681
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1037
00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:01.180
<v Speaker 6>So they got to get it out right away.</v>

1038
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:02.051
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1039
00:28:02.051 --> 00:28:02.261
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1040
00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:03.310
<v Speaker 6>especially if you're,</v>

1041
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.600
<v Speaker 6>if you're just riffing,</v>

1042
00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.720
<v Speaker 6>like sometimes when you're riffing,</v>

1043
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.190
<v Speaker 6>like the idea comes and you don't mean to cut somebody off,</v>

1044
00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:13.540
<v Speaker 6>but you do like it takes a while to figure out how to not do that because it</v>

1045
00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:17.560
<v Speaker 6>really is a matter of managing those two very specific and very different</v>

1046
00:28:17.561 --> 00:28:17.861
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1047
00:28:17.861 --> 00:28:22.861
<v Speaker 6>Listening and talking and then combining them together in the third thing,</v>

1048
00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.450
<v Speaker 6>which is a real conversation like did to,</v>

1049
00:28:25.451 --> 00:28:28.300
<v Speaker 6>the grossest thing is talking to someone when you know they're not really having</v>

1050
00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:29.200
<v Speaker 6>a conversation with you.</v>

1051
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:33.460
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe they have like a preplanned talking points and they might get them</v>

1052
00:28:33.461 --> 00:28:36.640
<v Speaker 6>out and then stop and then get them out again and then stop and then you realize</v>

1053
00:28:36.641 --> 00:28:37.090
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1054
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.331
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1055
00:28:37.331 --> 00:28:38.860
<v Speaker 6>you're not even dancing with me here.</v>

1056
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:39.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1058
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.331
<v Speaker 6>you got to,</v>

1059
00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:42.340
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's one thing to have a thought in your head.</v>

1060
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.350
<v Speaker 6>It's another thing to have a script like,</v>

1061
00:28:44.351 --> 00:28:45.190
<v Speaker 6>and what you're doing here,</v>

1062
00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:46.030
<v Speaker 6>it's like a script.</v>

1063
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 6>This isn't like a thought in your head like,</v>

1064
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.690
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1065
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.831
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

1066
00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:48.820
<v Speaker 6>this is my point of view.</v>

1067
00:28:48.821 --> 00:28:50.320
<v Speaker 6>Thank you as a person.</v>

1068
00:28:50.321 --> 00:28:51.141
<v Speaker 6>Let's have a communicate.</v>

1069
00:28:51.141 --> 00:28:51.401
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1070
00:28:51.401 --> 00:28:51.671
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>

1071
00:28:51.671 --> 00:28:52.480
<v Speaker 6>let's talk.</v>

1072
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.000
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes when you're talking to them you realize like this isn't a real</v>

1073
00:28:55.001 --> 00:28:55.834
<v Speaker 6>conversation.</v>

1074
00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.040
<v Speaker 6>This is like an act.</v>

1075
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first did I apply that to stand up sometimes I remember I was</v>

1076
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:04.140
<v Speaker 2>doing a audition,</v>

1077
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:04.891
<v Speaker 2>not on an addition.</v>

1078
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Meet Patrice enrich false.</v>

1079
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:08.700
<v Speaker 2>We're auditioning to see if we could go to Scotland together.</v>

1080
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.380
<v Speaker 2>This is when I was young and I had like,</v>

1081
00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I had to do 15 minutes and that was a lot for me and I had him all the jokes on</v>

1082
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:14.910
<v Speaker 2>the list and I had less.</v>

1083
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Next thing I was like going over it,</v>

1084
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:16.830
<v Speaker 2>going over it.</v>

1085
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And Patrice is like,</v>

1086
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I was at this and I said,</v>

1087
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.741
<v Speaker 2>Danny goes,</v>

1088
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:20.251
<v Speaker 2>let me see it.</v>

1089
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:21.550
<v Speaker 2>And so I gave it to him and he ripped it off.</v>

1090
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.681
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1091
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 2>why don't you do that man,</v>

1092
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked now.</v>

1093
00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:24.511
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1094
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:25.261
<v Speaker 2>just talk.</v>

1095
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:26.280
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to hear you.</v>

1096
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Practice jokes on stage.</v>

1097
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 2>So I had to grow up and just fucking just go,</v>

1098
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:31.770
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1099
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do talk for 15 minutes about whatever.</v>

1100
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And it was so much fucking better than had I run down a set list.</v>

1101
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1102
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.701
<v Speaker 2>and so then I,</v>

1103
00:29:38.701 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>nowadays it's like every set I've ever done now is just fucking</v>

1104
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 5>speaking and hoping I get from one place to another.</v>

1105
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 6>I would not have been happy if someone tore up my set list.</v>

1106
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.780
<v Speaker 5>I gotta Tell Ya,</v>

1107
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1108
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 5>that's bullshit.</v>

1109
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 5>He's also six,</v>

1110
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:51.900
<v Speaker 5>seven and 350</v>

1111
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.430
<v Speaker 6>both.</v>

1112
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you see,</v>

1113
00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:58.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything wrong with writing things out,</v>

1114
00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.470
<v Speaker 6>but I think you'll also,</v>

1115
00:30:00.471 --> 00:30:01.520
<v Speaker 6>when you go on stage,</v>

1116
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.660
<v Speaker 6>that's when you gotta be free.</v>

1117
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.740
<v Speaker 6>It'd be free of it.</v>

1118
00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:07.640
<v Speaker 6>But the more you rehearse it or practice it over and over in your mind.</v>

1119
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.120
<v Speaker 6>I've been like real adamant about that over the last few years.</v>

1120
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 6>I think it's made a big difference over the last year that I,</v>

1121
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:19.100
<v Speaker 6>I write down like almost all my bits over and over and over again when I'm</v>

1122
00:30:19.101 --> 00:30:20.390
<v Speaker 6>working on like a new set,</v>

1123
00:30:20.391 --> 00:30:21.920
<v Speaker 6>like a new sound like I'm working on right now,</v>

1124
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.390
<v Speaker 6>completing a new hour,</v>

1125
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.770
<v Speaker 6>which is pretty done.</v>

1126
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:25.760
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1127
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.250
<v Speaker 6>I write out each bit over and over and over again.</v>

1128
00:30:28.251 --> 00:30:31.970
<v Speaker 6>So my my notebook literally I would look like a mad person.</v>

1129
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.610
<v Speaker 6>Same thing over and over and over again.</v>

1130
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:35.661
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1131
00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:38.420
<v Speaker 6>it's all ridiculous subjects as it is,</v>

1132
00:30:38.421 --> 00:30:39.710
<v Speaker 6>but it's the same things.</v>

1133
00:30:39.711 --> 00:30:41.850
<v Speaker 6>It's like all work and no play makes jack a dull boy,</v>

1134
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:42.470
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1135
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 5>Well you said you used to do something that I never understood until I,</v>

1137
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 5>until I wrote my book wasn't that it was like you would say you would actually</v>

1138
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:48.941
<v Speaker 5>write,</v>

1139
00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:51.900
<v Speaker 5>you would turn to get out of that sleep thing on your computer so you would call</v>

1140
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 5>right room,</v>

1141
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 5>right room and you'd write and you'd write and you'd like it help you.</v>

1142
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 5>It really helps you work out.</v>

1143
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.400
<v Speaker 5>You jokes.</v>

1144
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 5>In my head I was like,</v>

1145
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.001
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1146
00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:58.721
<v Speaker 5>that sounds good for him,</v>

1147
00:30:58.721 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 5>but that'll never work for me because I write on stage so I'm better on stage.</v>

1148
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 5>But then I had to write like flying dildos,</v>

1149
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 5>which is not making it into the book.</v>

1150
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:06.551
<v Speaker 5>I wrote,</v>

1151
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 5>wrote it out as a story and I was like,</v>

1152
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 5>fuck man,</v>

1153
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 5>you've really,</v>

1154
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 5>when you are forced to sit and write things down and write it out long form,</v>

1155
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.910
<v Speaker 5>you come up with so many more tags.</v>

1156
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 5>So it's such a better story.</v>

1157
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.100
<v Speaker 5>I wrote the machine story and just for the book and it was like,</v>

1158
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1159
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you what to say this,</v>

1160
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 5>this for the first time this week.</v>

1161
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 5>And I will say that is a good fucking story on stage now.</v>

1162
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

1163
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 5>and I've been doing it for a while,</v>

1164
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.990
<v Speaker 5>but it's like just writing it,</v>

1165
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.243
<v Speaker 5>you really,</v>

1166
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 5>it makes you think of everything.</v>

1167
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:38.321
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1168
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:38.501
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

1169
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:40.450
<v Speaker 5>I need to fill up a room and used to be 16 pages.</v>

1170
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:41.284
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1171
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.100
<v Speaker 5>but so now I'm,</v>

1172
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 5>now I'm at this place where I want to write everything I fucking have.</v>

1173
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 6>It's um,</v>

1174
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:46.721
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1175
00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:48.460
<v Speaker 6>it applies with almost everything.</v>

1176
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 6>Attention and focus.</v>

1177
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:55.380
<v Speaker 6>You get better at things and you don't get better by sort of ignoring even</v>

1178
00:31:56.771 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 6>things that you already know.</v>

1179
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.900
<v Speaker 6>Being lazy to go over it.</v>

1180
00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:31:59.100 --> 00:31:59.351
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:02.950
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of theirs theirs look like stand up itself.</v>

1183
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.980
<v Speaker 6>Like there's all sorts of times where you're going to come up with something</v>

1184
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 6>that just didn't exist just out of a conversation and it's great and it's</v>

1185
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:12.130
<v Speaker 6>awesome.</v>

1186
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 6>And then you bring it on stage and Holy Shit,</v>

1187
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:14.740
<v Speaker 6>it's my new great bit.</v>

1188
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:15.850
<v Speaker 6>I said this really funny thing,</v>

1189
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 6>we're hanging out the other day and it became a great bit.</v>

1190
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 6>But that doesn't mean that you can't also get shit by sitting down and doing</v>

1191
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:23.650
<v Speaker 6>that boring work.</v>

1192
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 6>like the boring work,</v>

1194
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:26.284
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is.</v>

1195
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 6>There's an awesome book on this,</v>

1196
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 6>I mentioned a million times,</v>

1197
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:29.860
<v Speaker 6>but if you haven't heard it,</v>

1198
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 6>it's called the war of art by a guy named Steven Pressfield talked about silver</v>

1199
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 6>book.</v>

1200
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing book.</v>

1201
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.310
<v Speaker 6>Fucking love that book.</v>

1202
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 6>And what it's about is about overcoming resistance in that sometimes,</v>

1203
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 6>and it's not just about writing man,</v>

1204
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 6>it can be about losing weight.</v>

1205
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 6>It could be about not,</v>

1206
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.901
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1207
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:46.630
<v Speaker 6>like getting out of your house and,</v>

1208
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 6>and fucking,</v>

1209
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1210
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 6>not being a Weirdo.</v>

1211
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 6>Like you can get stagnant,</v>

1212
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 6>you can get stuck,</v>

1213
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 6>you can get trapped in a pattern.</v>

1214
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 6>And it's also easy to get trapped in a pattern where you sabotage yourself.</v>

1215
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.431
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1216
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 6>and that that happens with a lot of people.</v>

1217
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 6>A lot of what you do every day,</v>

1218
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 6>you know that you've reached you di you hadn't done is you sabotaging yourself.</v>

1219
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.020
<v Speaker 6>And it's an usually like in a response to pressure or response to,</v>

1220
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1221
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:12.981
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1222
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:14.060
<v Speaker 6>overwhelming,</v>

1223
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1224
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 6>obligations or things along those lines.</v>

1225
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1226
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 6>people look for distractions to take themselves away from the pressure of life,</v>

1227
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 6>but instead he,</v>

1228
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:23.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1229
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:24.430
<v Speaker 6>he sort of,</v>

1230
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1231
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 6>emphasizes how satisfying it is to embrace it and to be a professional and just</v>

1232
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 6>sit down and do the work.</v>

1233
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:30.951
<v Speaker 6>Just do it.</v>

1234
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 6>And this is what you do.</v>

1235
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.430
<v Speaker 6>This is how you,</v>

1236
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.191
<v Speaker 2>is your ethic,</v>

1237
00:33:33.191 --> 00:33:34.240
<v Speaker 2>hard to do that.</v>

1238
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:35.141
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do,</v>

1239
00:33:35.141 --> 00:33:36.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's super satisfying to do.</v>

1240
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.020
<v Speaker 2>You probably know this,</v>

1241
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.000
<v Speaker 2>you probably haven't been dealing this with us for a long time,</v>

1242
00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:43.750
<v Speaker 2>but I heard Amy Schumer on Bobby Kelly's podcast talk about what,</v>

1243
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.900
<v Speaker 2>how difficult being a hundred percent busy.</v>

1244
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:49.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you have like a TV show and you're doing the road and you're</v>

1245
00:33:49.721 --> 00:33:51.550
<v Speaker 2>doing a tour and you're doing everything and I was like,</v>

1246
00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:51.701
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1247
00:33:51.701 --> 00:33:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I really connect with that because I had always been the comic and I think the</v>

1248
00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:57.400
<v Speaker 2>majority of our friends are,</v>

1249
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I have dealt with this too,</v>

1250
00:33:58.421 --> 00:33:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Ari,</v>

1251
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

1252
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.281
<v Speaker 2>a Dunkin,</v>

1253
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:03.520
<v Speaker 2>every dude is that do that fucks around all day and then at night you got like</v>

1254
00:34:03.521 --> 00:34:07.300
<v Speaker 2>15 to do 15 minutes or 20 minutes and then you've done the work for the day.</v>

1255
00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:08.111
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have a day job,</v>

1256
00:34:08.111 --> 00:34:09.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe you audition,</v>

1257
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.690
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like working from eight in the morning until fucking 11 number</v>

1258
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.573
<v Speaker 2>every night.</v>

1259
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.853
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelming.</v>

1260
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.611
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1261
00:34:15.611 --> 00:34:16.960
<v Speaker 6>like having a TV job.</v>

1262
00:34:16.961 --> 00:34:18.850
<v Speaker 6>You mean for what?</v>

1263
00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:22.990
<v Speaker 6>Amy's still in is way harder than most because she's trying to do a sketch show.</v>

1264
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 6>The sketch shows.</v>

1265
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.930
<v Speaker 6>We did that with the man show.</v>

1266
00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:26.320
<v Speaker 6>Those.</v>

1267
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.500
<v Speaker 6>Those are not easy to do by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1268
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.100
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of work and there's a lot of politicking that goes on.</v>

1269
00:34:33.101 --> 00:34:36.190
<v Speaker 6>That shit can be really stressful because everybody doesn't agree.</v>

1270
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:36.371
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1271
00:34:36.371 --> 00:34:37.870
<v Speaker 6>this guy is going to have one vision,</v>

1272
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.440
<v Speaker 6>he's going to have another vision and you get together and that this fucking</v>

1273
00:34:41.441 --> 00:34:43.450
<v Speaker 6>producer doesn't agree with the network.</v>

1274
00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:45.040
<v Speaker 6>Who thinks that you go this way and,</v>

1275
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.710
<v Speaker 6>and then you got to go on stage that night,</v>

1276
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:48.220
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1277
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:48.760
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna,</v>

1278
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.930
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna have nothing left.</v>

1279
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.531
<v Speaker 2>She came,</v>

1280
00:34:50.531 --> 00:34:51.820
<v Speaker 2>she came to my Portland show,</v>

1281
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.270
<v Speaker 2>my late Portland Shell showed up and you could see it in her eyes like it's time</v>

1282
00:34:55.271 --> 00:34:56.104
<v Speaker 2>to fucking party.</v>

1283
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And she even said,</v>

1284
00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1285
00:34:59.020 --> 00:34:59.441
<v Speaker 2>I know Amy.</v>

1286
00:34:59.441 --> 00:35:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I can say what or anything like that.</v>

1287
00:35:00.551 --> 00:35:01.120
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1288
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:01.340

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.001
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1293
00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking to have somebody</v>

1294
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:07.540
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>

1295
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.100
<v Speaker 2>She didn't because I did not,</v>

1296
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1297
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.750
<v Speaker 6>doesn't she have a boyfriend?</v>

1298
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1299
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 6>That's also a famous guy.</v>

1300
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.730
<v Speaker 6>Nope,</v>

1301
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.563
<v Speaker 6>they don't do that anymore.</v>

1302
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 6>Eating anymore.</v>

1303
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.183
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

1304
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 2>But aren't they always on it?</v>

1305
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.351
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1306
00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:18.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just regular adults.</v>

1308
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Just regular adults.</v>

1309
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.520
<v Speaker 2>She didn't cheat anyone,</v>

1310
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't really matter.</v>

1311
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.451
<v Speaker 2>And she might've been saying it,</v>

1312
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:26.870
<v Speaker 2>the joke,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they have a,</v>

1350
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.210
<v Speaker 2>she has a blue jumper,</v>

1351
00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>like a baby blue jumper that she,</v>

1352
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Amy,</v>

1353
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.160
<v Speaker 2>when we used to,</v>

1354
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.780
<v Speaker 2>we worked on a show together that she wore one time and I went,</v>

1355
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1356
00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anyone in a jumper like shorts and like a jumper.</v>

1357
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And one day Georgia has the exact same jumper on and I was like,</v>

1358
00:36:11.501 --> 00:36:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1359
00:36:12.341 --> 00:36:13.840
<v Speaker 2>And she looked fucking just,</v>

1360
00:36:13.841 --> 00:36:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I gave me,</v>

1361
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I called Amy and took a picture of Georgia,</v>

1362
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.513
<v Speaker 2>sent it to her.</v>

1363
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.463
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1364
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.260
<v Speaker 2>she reminds me a lot of Amy.</v>

1365
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1366
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1367
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a fraternity of comedians.</v>

1368
00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1369
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.870
<v Speaker 2>It's nice.</v>

1370
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I ran into him at the airport.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1373
00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.410
<v Speaker 2>We ran into each other at the airport.</v>

1374
00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Standard Point says that.</v>

1375
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.380
<v Speaker 2>So it was fun running into a community in the airport.</v>

1376
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Portland.</v>

1383
00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1384
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.500
<v Speaker 2>we had partied two nights before,</v>

1385
00:36:41.501 --> 00:36:42.730
<v Speaker 2>but then we all were on the same flight,</v>

1386
00:36:42.731 --> 00:36:45.070
<v Speaker 2>random at in New York and we were getting down at the bar.</v>

1387
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I just ran into Marin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 1>We were both in Indianapolis at the same time and we're on the same flight and</v>

1391
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 1>he was right behind me.</v>

1392
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1393
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:52.951

1397
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't change seats to sit next to one on a plane now,</v>

1398
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's fun running into might if it was someone cool,</v>

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1400
00:37:01.301 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 2>but then I shouldn't have said that.</v>

1401
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.843
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1402
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 2>There are certain comedians that I'm not really into hanging out with and if</v>

1403
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 2>they cornered me,</v>

1404
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 2>it would kind of suck.</v>

1405

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1406

<v Speaker 2>let's just go down the list.</v>

1407
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a gospel.</v>

1408
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what is a,</v>

1419
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.480
<v Speaker 1>a little element in society that we too quickly accepted what the people that</v>

1420
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:39.690
<v Speaker 1>have a stand that they set up in front of the exit door at the fucking grocery</v>

1421
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:40.524
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

1428
00:37:45.351 --> 00:37:46.184

00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:54.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time,</v>

1448
00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 2>commit a hate crime by just passing them by.</v>

1449
00:37:58.771 --> 00:37:59.604
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's guilt.</v>

1452
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like the guilt stop after you walking out with your organic vegetables.</v>

1453
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Take two seconds to make sure we're porn stairs.</v>

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>A No consensus on what that squirting stuff is.</v>

1490
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.443
<v Speaker 2>Dana d Imani,</v>

1491
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 2>apparently she's changed her position,</v>

1492
00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 2>but she told me it was pissed.</v>

1493
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.341
<v Speaker 2>She saw me.</v>

1494
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:03.190
<v Speaker 2>This girl's a p and each other and now apparently she does not.</v>

1495
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>

1496
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.910
<v Speaker 2>there's not a gland inside a vagina that produces a liter of fluid too,</v>

1497
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.300
<v Speaker 2>so it explodes at the end and not real.</v>

1498
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.621
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1499
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:11.741
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1500
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:11.921
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1501
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1502
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 2>it's 100% real.</v>

1503
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:18.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not even like a fucking conspiracy to red band over here.</v>

1504
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 2>100% it's 100% proven that it's not pissed.</v>

1505
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:24.641
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1506
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

1507
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I've had squirt in my mouth millions of times.</v>

1508
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

1509
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I haven't definitely not your mouth.</v>

1510
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not pee.</v>

1511
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a 100% okay,</v>

1512
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:35.944
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

1513
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I did</v>

1514
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.910
<v Speaker 6>and I got to the myth.</v>

1515
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.500
<v Speaker 6>Here's the myths about squirting.</v>

1516
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:43.950
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1517
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.280
<v Speaker 6>Ready?</v>

1518
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.280
<v Speaker 6>Myth number one that it's p wow.</v>

1519
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.490
<v Speaker 6>Many experts believe that what comes out of a woman,</v>

1520
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.920
<v Speaker 6>she's a Jackie waiting his urine,</v>

1521
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.560
<v Speaker 6>but women who squirt will tell you otherwise.</v>

1522
00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.870
<v Speaker 6>Some have given it the smell,</v>

1523
00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:59.850
<v Speaker 6>even taste test and insist.</v>

1524
00:39:59.851 --> 00:40:00.451
<v Speaker 6>It's not.</v>

1525
00:40:00.451 --> 00:40:05.451
<v Speaker 6>P researchers determined that the fluid admitted during orgasm showed all the</v>

1526
00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:08.760
<v Speaker 6>characteristics of prostate plasma.</v>

1527
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.573
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1528
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.391
<v Speaker 2>Don't Bam.</v>

1529
00:40:11.391 --> 00:40:12.440
<v Speaker 2>When you don't even know what that is.</v>

1530
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.283
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

1531
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:14.591
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1532
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:15.424
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1533
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.500
<v Speaker 2>told you the pilot was on</v>

1534
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.400
<v Speaker 6>and not urine and concluded.</v>

1535
00:40:21.401 --> 00:40:24.860
<v Speaker 6>This might be proof that our para youth,</v>

1536
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.610
<v Speaker 6>real hmm.</v>

1537
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.820
<v Speaker 6>Skins gland,</v>

1538
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:29.050
<v Speaker 6>where the fluid comes from,</v>

1539
00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 6>function as female prostate glands.</v>

1540
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:33.214
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1541
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.230
<v Speaker 6>So apparently the theory is that in,</v>

1542
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 6>in some women,</v>

1543
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 6>this one gland can also,</v>

1544
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.070
<v Speaker 6>it functions almost as like in a jacket.</v>

1545
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:44.981
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

1546
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to accept that.</v>

1547
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Not I'm willing to accept that possibly there is a minority of women just like</v>

1548
00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:50.914
<v Speaker 2>Puffy Nipples,</v>

1549
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 2>like puppy nipples or something that not everyone has.</v>

1550
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.120
<v Speaker 2>But then you see them and you know what I mean?</v>

1551
00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I could make any girl squirt a hundred percent Brian throw up.</v>

1552
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:01.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1553
00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:02.314
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1554
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Not that kind of squares.</v>

1555
00:41:03.331 --> 00:41:03.581
<v Speaker 2>I be like,</v>

1556
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:03.850
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1557
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.110
<v Speaker 2>if this is what it takes to get them out of the bed,</v>

1558
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:05.944
<v Speaker 2>I'll piss in it.</v>

1559
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 2>But this is what it says.</v>

1560
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 6>This mean,</v>

1561
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 6>this website is saying that every woman is capable of doing it.</v>

1562
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 6>They just have to learn.</v>

1563
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.211
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1564
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 6>So it says there are lots of experts and female sex.</v>

1565
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 6>They only tell you what website this is called,</v>

1566
00:41:17.591 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 6>the Frisky,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Dot Com and it's six myths about squirting.</v>

1569
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 6>If you want to look forward to yourself,</v>

1570
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 6>if you're like,</v>

1571
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.830
<v Speaker 6>hmm,</v>

1572
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:24.900
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to know more about</v>

1573
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.873
<v Speaker 2>squirting Joe.</v>

1574
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.661
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a video,</v>

1575
00:41:26.661 --> 00:41:29.720
<v Speaker 2>it's also online that will teach you how to actually make a girl squirt.</v>

1576
00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's two like two main ways to make a girl squirt and obviously the one</v>

1577
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:34.010

1583
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 4>spot and it's really easy to do and you could just watch this video and you can</v>

1584
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 4>make real squirts and that it's really easy to do.</v>

1585
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:50.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1586
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:52.940
<v Speaker 3>But I saw a girl squirt when she was getting fucked up or,</v>

1587
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 3>but how's that work?</v>

1588
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Because that's a different kind of,</v>

1589
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1590
00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 4>orgasms.</v>

1591
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.110
<v Speaker 4>Christ.</v>

1592
00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:58.891
<v Speaker 4>That's not the same.</v>

1593
00:41:58.891 --> 00:42:00.330
<v Speaker 4>That's not g spot where it goes.</v>

1594
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.710
<v Speaker 4>That's actually that orgasm that she had is actually a deeper,</v>

1595
00:42:04.711 --> 00:42:06.030
<v Speaker 4>harder to get orgasms.</v>

1596
00:42:06.031 --> 00:42:07.050
<v Speaker 4>So you didn't really see that.</v>

1597
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.490
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of them aren't yet.</v>

1598
00:42:08.491 --> 00:42:13.390
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of porn actually fakes a squirting in Port Elizabeth.</v>

1599
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.670
<v Speaker 4>This is a hardcore,</v>

1600
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.810
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot about squirting man.</v>

1601
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.140
<v Speaker 4>I like [inaudible].</v>

1602
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot about squirting dude.</v>

1603
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:27.510
<v Speaker 4>I have waterproof sheets now because it will ruin your warranty on your mattress</v>

1604
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.930
<v Speaker 4>if it starts getting girls farting.</v>

1605
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.800
<v Speaker 3>That's one position.</v>

1606
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1607
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.590
<v Speaker 3>so this is another one.</v>

1608
00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:35.940
<v Speaker 3>It's also saying that it's not,</v>

1609
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.240
<v Speaker 3>that's a myth that it's caused by the stimulation of the g spot.</v>

1610
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.573
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1611
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Every woman is not capable of doing it.</v>

1612
00:42:43.321 --> 00:42:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry when I said that,</v>

1613
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.630
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a myth.</v>

1614
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.060
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of the cases,</v>

1615
00:42:48.061 --> 00:42:49.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that they're saying,</v>

1616
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.903
<v Speaker 3>it's a myth.</v>

1617
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Every woman's capable then never woman's not capable.</v>

1618
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.650
<v Speaker 3>This is saying in the five myths,</v>

1619
00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.590
<v Speaker 3>one of them is,</v>

1620
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.490
<v Speaker 3>is not p two is that every woman is capable of doing it.</v>

1621
00:42:59.491 --> 00:43:00.240
<v Speaker 3>They just have to learn.</v>

1622
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.700
<v Speaker 3>She's saying no or he or whoever wrote this,</v>

1623
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.860
<v Speaker 3>ask Jeeves has a different opinion.</v>

1624
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:05.551
<v Speaker 3>It's Amy.</v>

1625
00:43:05.551 --> 00:43:06.384
<v Speaker 3>A woman they name.</v>

1626
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.313
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1627
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:08.603
<v Speaker 3>I made her squirt</v>

1628
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.033

1630
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:12.691
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1631
00:43:12.691 --> 00:43:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Ami when named John.</v>

1632
00:43:14.551 --> 00:43:14.791
<v Speaker 3>Amy,</v>

1633
00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

1634
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.983
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1635
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1636
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:19.710
<v Speaker 3>regardless everything you like porn porn.</v>

1637
00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 3>I've disconnected the tad bit from porn because I,</v>

1638
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.291
<v Speaker 3>I still watch it,</v>

1639
00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:24.480
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems like a lot of the shit,</v>

1640
00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.810
<v Speaker 3>the way you've seen a porn just isn't stuff that happens to this website.</v>

1641
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Just lost me.</v>

1642
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.090
<v Speaker 3>You just said exactly what I was reading,</v>

1643
00:43:30.091 --> 00:43:30.924
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

1644
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure?</v>

1645
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:32.243
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1646
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.200
<v Speaker 3>exactly why you were saying this.</v>

1647
00:43:34.201 --> 00:43:37.050
<v Speaker 3>It's at number six as far as the mess of porn,</v>

1648
00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.210
<v Speaker 3>that what you see in porn is real.</v>

1649
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.770
<v Speaker 3>The porn is unrealistic sexual expectations and imposes upon us.</v>

1650
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.220
<v Speaker 3>We see a large amount of fluid squirting out of a woman's vagina in porn.</v>

1651
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Keep in mind this could be faked by putting water in her vagina before filming</v>

1652
00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:53.370
<v Speaker 3>or having a woman p on camera.</v>

1653
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.750
<v Speaker 3>One Who can have Jackie late will tell you that it's easiest when you're relaxed</v>

1654
00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.840
<v Speaker 3>and having cameras on you is not the most relaxing when experience pleasure.</v>

1655
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about my free cams before it.</v>

1656
00:44:02.501 --> 00:44:05.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the biggest thing right now the other girls are doing is they have these</v>

1657
00:44:05.441 --> 00:44:10.120
<v Speaker 4>dildos that actually have water in it pushes the water in you and then they</v>

1658
00:44:10.121 --> 00:44:11.980
<v Speaker 4>explode and so every girl's squirting,</v>

1659
00:44:11.981 --> 00:44:12.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1660
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:12.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1661
00:44:12.671 --> 00:44:14.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like.</v>

1662
00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:14.950
<v Speaker 3>So may,</v>

1663
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:15.701
<v Speaker 3>so there you go.</v>

1664
00:44:15.701 --> 00:44:19.360
<v Speaker 3>While you were saying that while you were saying that I was reading it</v>

1665
00:44:19.361 --> 00:44:20.194
<v Speaker 3>serendipity.</v>

1666
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.063

1668
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we already are chemo savvy.</v>

1669
00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like the new ad for the lone ranger with Johnny Depp.</v>

1670
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what I feel like,</v>

1674
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.003
<v Speaker 3>this is how this,</v>

1675
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 3>this is how my conversations work.</v>

1676
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1677
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Depp is the prototype for the death squad compound.</v>

1678
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Depp is,</v>

1679
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Depp owns a whole street in Los Angeles and the Hollywood hills and he's</v>

1682
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 3>but he owns every house.</v>

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:14.001

00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:19.850
<v Speaker 3>How about let's Google squirting is not real.</v>

1735
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.693
<v Speaker 3>How</v>

1736
00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.450
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a Google squirting is fake.</v>

1737
00:46:23.451 --> 00:46:24.284
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1738
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.960
<v Speaker 3>how can you fucking research a subject while you're on,</v>

1739
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you right now,</v>

1740
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.850
<v Speaker 3>how could you drank it,</v>

1741
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Joe Merrill's.</v>

1742
00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:35.541
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1743
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:36.081
<v Speaker 3>Gallons.</v>

1744
00:46:36.081 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 3>You'd be dead.</v>

1745
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Can you see possibly how we,</v>

1746
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:38.900
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1747
00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.310
<v Speaker 3>your opinion might be suspect.</v>

1748
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.153
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

1749
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.720
<v Speaker 3>I am telling you this is something that some women is definitely real.</v>

1750
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.700
<v Speaker 3>I think here's another website.</v>

1751
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Squirting who's for real and who's faking it.</v>

1752
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.983
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1753
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.170
<v Speaker 3>this is websites that are debating whether or not women are fake and who's</v>

1754
00:46:57.171 --> 00:46:57.681
<v Speaker 3>faking it.</v>

1755
00:46:57.681 --> 00:47:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And how to know proof squirting is fake.</v>

1756
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.750
<v Speaker 3>This is silly.</v>

1757
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1758
00:47:02.211 --> 00:47:02.721
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1759
00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's fake.</v>

1760
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I think too many people say do it in too many girls do do it.</v>

1761
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a lot of people that do fake it.</v>

1762
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.160
<v Speaker 3>But apparently one of the myths is that every woman can do it and [inaudible]</v>

1763
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.770
<v Speaker 3>not every woman can do it apparently.</v>

1764
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.780
<v Speaker 3>And it depends upon that one gland.</v>

1765
00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:20.801
<v Speaker 3>Some women,</v>

1766
00:47:20.801 --> 00:47:21.550
<v Speaker 3>they have that,</v>

1767
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:23.050
<v Speaker 3>that gland access.</v>

1768
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like gagging like,</v>

1769
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:24.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1770
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:25.403
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1771
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.970
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of women gag,</v>

1772
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 3>like some women gag during sex,</v>

1773
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>but now think a lot of what goes</v>

1774
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>on in porn is a lot of over the top gagging like when Morris,</v>

1775
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 2>and so it's what it is,</v>

1776
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 2>is it works one time.</v>

1777
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just like fucking comedy.</v>

1778
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.031
<v Speaker 2>It worked.</v>

1779
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 2>One time.</v>

1780
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Savannah Samson got deep throat by Rocco's to Friday's and cried,</v>

1781
00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:41.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1782
00:47:41.821 --> 00:47:42.654
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>

1783
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Someone Yoshi told me,</v>

1784
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 2>if you want to see where you want to see,</v>

1785
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 2>like what he was inspired,</v>

1786
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.390
<v Speaker 2>what inspires him?</v>

1787
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:49.901
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1788
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:50.734
<v Speaker 2>watch it.</v>

1789
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:51.071
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1790
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>

1791
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.143
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to watch.</v>

1792
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Why is it tough to watch?</v>

1793
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.593
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1794
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 2>she is not a porn star at the time.</v>

1795
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 2>She's married and she is her.</v>

1796
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 2>She asked for her anniversary for her husband to go to France and fuck rockets</v>

1797
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 2>or Fridays or Italy,</v>

1798
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1799
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe France,</v>

1800
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.481
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>

1801
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:05.314
<v Speaker 2>nine barrels.</v>

1802
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 2>So they go to,</v>

1803
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1804
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.231
<v Speaker 2>she flies over.</v>

1805
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:08.981
<v Speaker 2>It turned another girl,</v>

1806
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 2>but the other girl was clearly like,</v>

1807
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1808
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 2>trail friendly with Rocco's Freddy.</v>

1809
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.421
<v Speaker 2>She's written it before.</v>

1810
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:15.280
<v Speaker 2>She knows what to expect in the curves.</v>

1811
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Savannah's Sampson does not.</v>

1812
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1813
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you right now is one of the most aggressive pieces of porn I've ever</v>

1814
00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:25.861
<v Speaker 2>witnessed it is it she's crying within like the first five minutes and it's a 45</v>

1815
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 2>minute fuck.</v>

1816
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1817
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:28.820
<v Speaker 2>like she is,</v>

1818
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:29.653
<v Speaker 2>is that her?</v>

1819
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1820
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.090
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1821
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:31.541
<v Speaker 2>It's you,</v>

1822

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1824
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:33.230

1825
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.063
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1826
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1827
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:35.581

1829
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:37.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1830
00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get anything.</v>

1831
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:38.831
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1832
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:39.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1834
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I feel like now I feel like we're getting,</v>

1835
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:41.430
<v Speaker 2>getting pranked.</v>

1836
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 2>So I'm so,</v>

1837
00:48:42.311 --> 00:48:42.481
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1838
00:48:42.481 --> 00:48:44.080
<v Speaker 2>but within the first five minutes,</v>

1839
00:48:44.081 --> 00:48:44.914
<v Speaker 2>she is like,</v>

1840
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:49.090
<v Speaker 2>like she can't breathe and she sits in the thing and it is the realist fucking</v>

1841
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:49.421
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>

1842
00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:49.601
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1843
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:50.231
<v Speaker 2>did you like that?</v>

1844
00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:50.861
<v Speaker 2>Did you like that?</v>

1845
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Did you like be all you can be on this?</v>

1846
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can be on this baby if you did not like you can tell me.</v>

1847
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 2>And she's wiping tears away from where I was sick.</v>

1848
00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really like that.</v>

1849
00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1850
00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:58.451
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1851
00:48:58.451 --> 00:48:59.950
<v Speaker 2>then we just need to find another position.</v>

1852
00:48:59.951 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Laser on her back and starts throwing fucking her.</v>

1853
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:02.321
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1854
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 2>you can just see her body going.</v>

1855
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And then this is an acting.</v>

1856
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:08.900
<v Speaker 2>It's Yoshi man.</v>

1861
00:49:13.121 --> 00:49:18.121

1862
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 2>did she ever tell him to stop?</v>

1863
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1864
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:20.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1865
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 2>because this was her anniversary gift.</v>

1866
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 2>She wanted this.</v>

1867
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:24.671
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1868
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:25.690
<v Speaker 2>So she enjoyed it.</v>

1869
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1870
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.090
<v Speaker 2>that's debatable.</v>

1871
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 2>She did come back the next night and do it again,</v>

1872
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:32.470
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if she enjoyed it.</v>

1873
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 2>The fuck are you even saying?</v>

1874
00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.443
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she,</v>

1875
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 2>if you got to watch it and go crazy and that's why she did it twice.</v>

1876
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I met her,</v>

1877
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 2>she's pretty,</v>

1878
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1879
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.233
<v Speaker 2>pretty out there,</v>

1880
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.740
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1881
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 2>but she became a porn store right after this because it was such a popular video</v>

1882
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:46.031
<v Speaker 2>that she,</v>

1883
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:47.590
<v Speaker 2>like all of a sudden she was married,</v>

1884
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:48.341
<v Speaker 2>she was married,</v>

1885
00:49:48.341 --> 00:49:51.940
<v Speaker 2>she was a stripper scores and she said her husband for my anniversary,</v>

1886
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to go over and fuck Rocco's Freddy's wow.</v>

1887
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.011
<v Speaker 2>And she did.</v>

1888
00:49:55.011 --> 00:49:55.900
<v Speaker 2>And the husband said,</v>

1889
00:49:55.901 --> 00:49:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool with that.</v>

1890
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:56.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:49:57.491 --> 00:49:57.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>

1893
00:49:57.731 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I think there's still married.</v>

1894
00:49:58.571 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to say they're still married.</v>

1895
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I am guessing defense jokes.</v>

1896
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:04.010
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

1897
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Have you watched the video?</v>

1898
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I just googled it and it's like,</v>

1899
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:06.560

<v Speaker 2>it's the first bit of Gonzo porn now.</v>

1902
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Gonzo porn is like,</v>

1903
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking like I'm an expert.</v>

1904
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Important.</v>

1905
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1906
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I've watched you and him together get together and start your own fucking school</v>

1907
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.030
<v Speaker 2>and how to teach people about what really goes on in bedrooms.</v>

1908
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.220
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I that now I see now I now I watched that.</v>

1910
00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I was telling Brian it's hard to watch follow some girls on vine because you've</v>

1911
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 2>seen them in porn and then you see them on vine as a,</v>

1912
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 2>as like a regular person.</v>

1913
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:32.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1914
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 2>What's that girl's name again?</v>

1915
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Like it then it's like the whole time I'm like,</v>

1916
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like seeing a,</v>

1917
00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like seeing someone undercover cause it's like this girl that you've seen</v>

1918
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:48.800
<v Speaker 2>just too fucking crazy shit that she's at the Kentucky Derby just hanging out</v>

1919
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 2>with regular people and they're all hanging out with her.</v>

1920
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:50.701
<v Speaker 2>And pardon me,</v>

1921
00:50:50.701 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1922
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.771
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1923
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Like it really is kind of voyeuristic going like sexism.</v>

1924
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

1925
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody wants to do it but nobody wants you to see him do it.</v>

1926
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 1>We have like weird things like that.</v>

1927
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Especially like women,</v>

1928
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 1>like a woman who's willing to let the whole world here.</v>

1929
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1930
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.040
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

1931
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a really gangster move for girl.</v>

1932
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1933
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1934
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how many guys would do it if you didn't show their face.</v>

1935
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Every guy.</v>

1936
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1937
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

1938
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:19.321
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1939
00:51:19.321 --> 00:51:19.801
<v Speaker 1>it's just the,</v>

1940
00:51:19.801 --> 00:51:21.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole thing is weird.</v>

1941
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that people want to see you.</v>

1942
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:26.270
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that you want to see them.</v>

1943
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that,</v>

1944
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1945
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:29.930
<v Speaker 1>we hide our nakedness from each other.</v>

1946
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1947
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 1>just close themselves are so odd.</v>

1948
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:33.460
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1949
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:38.460
<v Speaker 1>the body is like literally accepting a constant symbiotic relationship to its</v>

1950
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.370
<v Speaker 1>own creations.</v>

1951
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 1>A constant relationship with clothing,</v>

1952
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.850
<v Speaker 1>with shoes,</v>

1953
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:44.870
<v Speaker 1>with pants,</v>

1954
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:45.261
<v Speaker 1>with your,</v>

1955
00:51:45.261 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly draped in close.</v>

1956
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're on the,</v>

1957
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:49.550
<v Speaker 1>in a beach,</v>

1958
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:49.851
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1959
00:51:49.851 --> 00:51:52.280
<v Speaker 1>your clothes are represented there.</v>

1960
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Skimpy little thing that just covers the minimal areas.</v>

1961
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 1>But when you know,</v>

1962
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 1>you get naked and he gets sexual,</v>

1963
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's the only time when you're completely,</v>

1964
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1965
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 1>rid of these clothes and that's just temporary.</v>

1966
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And do that for a little bit and get your clothes back on.</v>

1967
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1968
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have this weird relationship with clothes,</v>

1969
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:10.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1970
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've just accepted that these fucking things that we make are a part</v>

1971
00:52:14.991 --> 00:52:17.840
<v Speaker 1>of our everyday life with no question whatsoever.</v>

1972
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And that to have that,</v>

1973
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:21.470
<v Speaker 1>that not be the case is bad.</v>

1974
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:22.180
<v Speaker 2>And then when,</v>

1975
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.090
<v Speaker 2>and then like my daughter's going through tactile issues with clothing.</v>

1976
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Like she doesn't like wearing,</v>

1977
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:27.970
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't like wearing like,</v>

1978
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1979
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>she asked for a knee high socks,</v>

1980
00:52:29.681 --> 00:52:29.861
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1981
00:52:29.861 --> 00:52:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Watch to wear cowboy boots.</v>

1982
00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Like some clothes feel comfortable.</v>

1983
00:52:32.351 --> 00:52:33.041
<v Speaker 2>I have the same problem.</v>

1984
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't wear underwear because it's</v>

1985
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.471
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

1986
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

1987
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:40.111
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1988
00:52:40.111 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I haven't wore underwear in a long time because it drives me fucking cotton.</v>

1989
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:42.820
<v Speaker 2>A zipper.</v>

1990
00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.060
<v Speaker 2>So you never have accidents and being somebody that drinks a lot of course.</v>

1991
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

1992
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:47.311
<v Speaker 2>drinking lot.</v>

1993
00:52:47.311 --> 00:52:47.851
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean shit.</v>

1994
00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Your pants a lot by a lot.</v>

1995
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1996
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean once a month and so,</v>

1997
00:52:52.571 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1998
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely shit my pants,</v>

1999
00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

2000
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.331
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>

2001
00:52:55.331 --> 00:52:55.921
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine there.</v>

2002
00:52:55.921 --> 00:53:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Brody 30 says he at least sits itself like once every two weeks.</v>

2003
00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:01.170
<v Speaker 2>There's one he probably does.</v>

2004
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2005
00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.493
<v Speaker 2>cause he had the board.</v>

2006
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:03.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2007
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.330
<v Speaker 2>but I'm still to go back to your point is that once someone does have issues</v>

2008
00:53:07.331 --> 00:53:08.050
<v Speaker 2>with closing,</v>

2009
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.550
<v Speaker 2>they're broken and you've got,</v>

2010
00:53:09.551 --> 00:53:09.761
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2011
00:53:09.761 --> 00:53:09.911
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2012
00:53:09.911 --> 00:53:10.601
<v Speaker 2>we gotta fix that.</v>

2013
00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:10.901
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2014
00:53:10.901 --> 00:53:11.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2015
00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:11.441
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2016
00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Why is what you're saying is it's not natural to us.</v>

2017
00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at a three piece suit,</v>

2018
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.310
<v Speaker 2>how fucking ridiculous to say I was,</v>

2019
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I went to see the great Gatsby last night.</v>

2020
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It suck.</v>

2021
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:21.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2022
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it did not suck man.</v>

2023
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>People keep saying that it sucked because they made some</v>

2024
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 6>really odd choices and one of the really odd choices,</v>

2025
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:33.891
<v Speaker 6>where did they use a lot of modern music like Jay z music and there's rap music</v>

2026
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:35.874
<v Speaker 6>in there,</v>

2027
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 6>but it's a period piece about the 1920s.</v>

2028
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:40.260
<v Speaker 6>Like why would you have,</v>

2029
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.440
<v Speaker 6>why would you have Jay z plan and why would you have a hip hop?</v>

2030
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:46.110
<v Speaker 6>Why would you have like popular music like a,</v>

2031
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:46.801
<v Speaker 6>what's that girl's name?</v>

2032
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 6>Alana Ray,</v>

2033
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 6>I think she's saying it sounds like her.</v>

2034
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:51.653
<v Speaker 6>And it was,</v>

2035
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 6>it's too obviously,</v>

2036
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:54.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2037
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 6>modern and I thought it was really fascinating that they did it that way.</v>

2038
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.570
<v Speaker 6>I don't necessarily know if it was the best way to do it,</v>

2039
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 6>but it gave an unmistakable energy that worked,</v>

2040
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:04.771
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2041
00:54:04.771 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 6>it was really good.</v>

2042
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 6>So like people complaining that they were using this rap and it just,</v>

2043
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:10.710
<v Speaker 6>I see what you're saying,</v>

2044
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:11.660
<v Speaker 6>but if you just said,</v>

2045
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 6>can accept it as a work of art,</v>

2046
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 6>it's like a visual masterpiece.</v>

2047
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 6>I saw it in three D it's an amazing movie.</v>

2048
00:54:18.871 --> 00:54:19.681
<v Speaker 6>The way they shot it.</v>

2049
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen in my life.</v>

2050
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:22.610
<v Speaker 6>Did you bring your own glass?</v>

2051
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:23.180
<v Speaker 6>Ratable?</v>

2052
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:23.381
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2053
00:54:23.381 --> 00:54:23.431
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2054
00:54:23.431 --> 00:54:23.551
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2055
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.300
<v Speaker 6>You get them there,</v>

2056
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:24.520
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2057
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.231
<v Speaker 6>but they're not real.</v>

2058
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>

2059
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 6>they're not the paper ones.</v>

2060
00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2061
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:27.923
<v Speaker 6>They're plastic.</v>

2062
00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:29.043
<v Speaker 6>You recycle.</v>

2063
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2064
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:30.060
<v Speaker 6>I've never been,</v>

2065
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.893
<v Speaker 6>I've never been to it.</v>

2066
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 6>Three d movies bother me.</v>

2067
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:32.311
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2068
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 6>the new Three d man is amazing.</v>

2069
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.990
<v Speaker 6>I've never yet they have now God damn this.</v>

2070
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2071
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.010
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>

2072
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 6>if you go to see,</v>

2073
00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:39.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2074
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:40.440
<v Speaker 6>the great Gatsby need,</v>

2075
00:54:40.441 --> 00:54:44.340
<v Speaker 6>don't see the three d you're going to miss on half the movie because it's just</v>

2076
00:54:44.341 --> 00:54:45.550
<v Speaker 6>the effect that it created.</v>

2077
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:45.811
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2078
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 6>it's visually,</v>

2079
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:47.940
<v Speaker 6>it's stunning.</v>

2080
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Speaker 6>It really is like a work of art.</v>

2081
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 6>Like you bet it is beautiful.</v>

2082
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:51.990
<v Speaker 6>It's so beautiful.</v>

2083
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:53.760
<v Speaker 6>It's just the way it's shot is beautiful.</v>

2084
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.200
<v Speaker 6>The way it's edited as beautiful.</v>

2085
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 6>It's an amazing movie,</v>

2086
00:54:56.221 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2087
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:00.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean I saw the great gay or read the Great Gatsby in high school.</v>

2088
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:00.951
<v Speaker 6>I saw,</v>

2089
00:55:00.951 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 6>I really barely remember the plot and I was sort of picking things up as I went</v>

2090
00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:05.700
<v Speaker 6>along.</v>

2091
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 6>So going into it with that,</v>

2092
00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2093
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:13.250
<v Speaker 6>I really enjoyed it but I know people that have read it recently and they didn't</v>

2094
00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 6>enjoy it as much because they felt like it deviated too much from,</v>

2095
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2096
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.983
<v Speaker 6>from the book.</v>

2097
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 6>But I can't say that because again,</v>

2098
00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to read it again.</v>

2099
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 6>And it was a long ass time ago but it was a really enjoyable movie</v>

2100
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.103
<v Speaker 5>was really good.</v>

2101
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking interesting.</v>

2102
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.410
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to do those period pieces with music.</v>

2103
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:31.820
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>

2104
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 5>there was a movie that was made by outkast called Idlewild,</v>

2105
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.630
<v Speaker 5>the band outcast.</v>

2106
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:37.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2107
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Pop.</v>

2108
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.920
<v Speaker 5>And they did all their own music and it was set in like the 30s,</v>

2109
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 5>but it was cool as shit because they did all the music.</v>

2110
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah that's bad ass.</v>

2111
00:55:44.701 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 5>Like they should have hired,</v>

2112
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:49.680
<v Speaker 5>I think they should have hired some band to do all the music and just make it</v>

2113
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:50.190
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

2114
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.570
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2115
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:50.910
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2116
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 5>Cause that Glenn Miller was a bad ass.</v>

2117
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.400
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Glenn Miller was the prototype for Badass rock stars.</v>

2118
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.350
<v Speaker 5>He was the m and m but in World War II.</v>

2119
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 5>You anything Buckland Miller.</v>

2120
00:55:59.340 --> 00:55:59.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.320

2122
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.100

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:06.400

2128
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:06.910

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2134
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.390
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe it was too.</v>

2135
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.753
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2136
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2137
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:18.820
<v Speaker 5>I might be,</v>

2138
00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I may not even be Glenn Miller.</v>

2139
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you got a story in my head and I'm like,</v>

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.640
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2146
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.090
<v Speaker 6>I see that you would want to have mood music in a movie about a period of the</v>

2147
00:56:36.091 --> 00:56:37.140
<v Speaker 6>music from that period.</v>

2148
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:38.820
<v Speaker 6>Like get it girl talk to do it,</v>

2151
00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:42.481
<v Speaker 6>it worked.</v>

2152
00:56:42.481 --> 00:56:43.620
<v Speaker 6>It worked for me at least.</v>

2153
00:56:43.621 --> 00:56:45.030
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was an amazing movie.</v>

2154
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:49.140
<v Speaker 6>But I was amazed also when I went on rotten tomatoes when I saw it only got like</v>

2155
00:56:49.141 --> 00:56:50.040
<v Speaker 6>43%.</v>

2156
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.181
<v Speaker 6>How does that work?</v>

2157
00:56:51.181 --> 00:56:53.640
<v Speaker 6>I never understand how wrong the world is.</v>

2158
00:56:53.641 --> 00:56:56.010
<v Speaker 6>Overrun with comments.</v>

2159
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:56.893
<v Speaker 6>That's what I say.</v>

2160
00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:02.240
<v Speaker 6>I think the current infestation that we have is that an unprecedented high level</v>

2161
00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:06.240
<v Speaker 6>and I think clients are much more likely to be mouthy.</v>

2162
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.610
<v Speaker 6>They're much more likely to be active then.</v>

2163
00:57:08.611 --> 00:57:12.660
<v Speaker 6>Then the people that are honestly reviewing things from a point of view where</v>

2164
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:13.021
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2165
00:57:13.021 --> 00:57:15.390
<v Speaker 6>you could relate to them or where you could,</v>

2166
00:57:15.391 --> 00:57:15.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2167
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2168
00:57:16.231 --> 00:57:17.940
<v Speaker 6>you could get something out of the reviews.</v>

2169
00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:18.931
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of people.</v>

2170
00:57:18.931 --> 00:57:20.670
<v Speaker 6>You're not getting shit out of the review.</v>

2171
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:22.920
<v Speaker 6>You're getting their shitbag personality.</v>

2172
00:57:22.921 --> 00:57:24.990
<v Speaker 6>Like you ever go on Yelp and you see five star,</v>

2173
00:57:24.991 --> 00:57:25.441
<v Speaker 6>five star,</v>

2174
00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:26.011
<v Speaker 6>five star,</v>

2175
00:57:26.011 --> 00:57:26.970
<v Speaker 6>one star,</v>

2176
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:32.210
<v Speaker 6>read that one star read and then go to their page and read what a miserable cunt</v>

2177
00:57:32.581 --> 00:57:34.470
<v Speaker 6>bag human being that is.</v>

2178
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.000
<v Speaker 6>Nine Times out of 10,</v>

2179
00:57:36.001 --> 00:57:38.030
<v Speaker 6>it's just someone just spewing,</v>

2180
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:38.291
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2181

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2183
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:40.110
<v Speaker 5>I gave someone a negative review.</v>

2184
00:57:40.111 --> 00:57:41.730
<v Speaker 5>I joined Yelp to give a negative view.</v>

2185
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.420
<v Speaker 5>That's arrogant.</v>

2186
00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.380
<v Speaker 5>How dare you,</v>

2187
00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:44.220
<v Speaker 5>how dare they,</v>

2188
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:45.053
<v Speaker 5>what did they do?</v>

2189
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.893

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.600
<v Speaker 5>like real dicky.</v>

2299
00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:29.901
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

2300
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:30.051
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2301
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:30.321
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2302
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 5>just wasn't,</v>

2303
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.610
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.</v>

2304
00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

2305
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:34.670
<v Speaker 5>maybe we should just change the name on the menu and then,</v>

2306
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:35.000
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2307
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 5>And I was like a gas and then he was like,</v>

2308
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:37.761
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2309
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 5>well sorry.</v>

2310
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.191
<v Speaker 5>And walked away.</v>

2311
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:41.024
<v Speaker 5>And I went,</v>

2312
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2313
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:42.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm joining Yelp,</v>

2314
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:42.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm joining the,</v>

2315
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 5>but I'm telling you everyone of fuck this place is the place.</v>

2316
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2317
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:46.251
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2318
00:59:46.251 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say it now because</v>

2319
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:48.283
<v Speaker 6>everyone knows it.</v>

2320
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.891
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2321
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:50.420
<v Speaker 6>And your name's Bert Kreischer on Yelp.</v>

2322
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 6>Dick,</v>

2323
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.553
<v Speaker 6>what are you working on?</v>

2324
00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.533
<v Speaker 6>Just getting to know.</v>

2325
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.201
<v Speaker 6>Let me tell you what,</v>

2326
00:59:53.201 --> 00:59:54.034
<v Speaker 6>let me tell you what happened.</v>

2327
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.430
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you what happened afterwards.</v>

2328
00:59:55.431 --> 00:59:56.181
<v Speaker 5>This is obviously,</v>

2329
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 5>this is also the fucking shitty thing about Yelp.</v>

2330
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2331
00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:00.130
<v Speaker 5>So I posted,</v>

2332
01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:00.771
<v Speaker 5>posted on Yelp.</v>

2333
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:02.780
<v Speaker 5>Yelp goes automatically to your Twitter and it,</v>

2334
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 5>and it gets tweeted and then all of a sudden these people see it.</v>

2335
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Now I have 84,000 followers on Twitter.</v>

2336
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.104
<v Speaker 5>So everyone's like,</v>

2337
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.341
<v Speaker 5>start saying like,</v>

2338
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:10.911
<v Speaker 5>what happened?</v>

2339
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>

2340
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 5>And these people have 350 and they start seeing it and they're like,</v>

2341
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>

2342
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.310
<v Speaker 5>So then they start coming at me like,</v>

2343
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.850
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2344
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 5>like it's the way Yelp works is they find out if you give him a bad review and</v>

2345
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:22.370
<v Speaker 5>then they want you to take it off because that really does affect our business.</v>

2346
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.860
<v Speaker 5>So it became a pain in the fucking ass.</v>

2347
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:27.480
<v Speaker 5>And then I felt like a cyber bully for saying I didn't like a meal.</v>

2348
01:00:27.481 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 5>I should have just kept my mouth shut and walked away.</v>

2349
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.550
<v Speaker 5>But it was like they were such assholes and they were like,</v>

2350
01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:32.061
<v Speaker 5>come back in.</v>

2351
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:32.361
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2352
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 5>there's no way I'm coming back in.</v>

2353
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.941
<v Speaker 5>It was in Baltimore.</v>

2354
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 5>It was named,</v>

2355
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:35.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2356
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.750
<v Speaker 5>you didn't delete frank,</v>

2357
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.030
<v Speaker 5>frank and nic's.</v>

2358
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 5>You deleted your review.</v>

2359
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.101
<v Speaker 5>No I didn't.</v>

2360
01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 5>I left it up.</v>

2361
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:41.470
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that guy.</v>

2362
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:42.303
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2363
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called frank and nic's frank and next.</v>

2364
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 5>And where was it?</v>

2365
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.750
<v Speaker 5>It was in Baltimore right next to Camden yards.</v>

2366
01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 5>It was right next to the stadium.</v>

2367
01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:49.011
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2368
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:51.290
<v Speaker 5>and I was excited cause everyone was like,</v>

2369
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 5>well you should really give it a second chance.</v>

2370
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:53.031
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2371
01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:53.391
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

2372
01:00:53.391 --> 01:00:54.440
<v Speaker 5>but I wrote about bad review.</v>

2373
01:00:54.441 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to know that.</v>

2374
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.280
<v Speaker 5>And I know that the chef was chefs a big word for what this dude was.</v>

2375
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.960
<v Speaker 5>The Cook was a fucking Dick and I would not put it past him to make sure I did</v>

2376
01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 5>not enjoy it again.</v>

2377
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:05.121
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna let it,</v>

2378
01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:05.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna let a dude,</v>

2379
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.321
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that.</v>

2380
01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Speaker 5>I made it vocal.</v>

2381
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.020
<v Speaker 5>Make something that I'm going to put my mouth.</v>

2382
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 5>That's a very good move.</v>

2383
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:11.750
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't go,</v>

2384
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:11.931
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2385
01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 5>and then I felt bad,</v>

2386
01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 5>but then everyone was like,</v>

2387
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 5>I went and did radio and they were like,</v>

2388
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:16.311
<v Speaker 5>next morning they're like,</v>

2389
01:01:16.311 --> 01:01:17.660
<v Speaker 5>what's your problem with frank and nic's?</v>

2390
01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:18.100
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2391
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.700
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2392
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.241
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

2393
01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:22.600
<v Speaker 6>They need to hear that too because someone needs to not do that.</v>

2394
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:23.890
<v Speaker 6>Someone needs to,</v>

2395
01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:24.181
<v Speaker 6>if you're,</v>

2396
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.740
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be a chef and a guy has a question about the food,</v>

2397
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:29.290
<v Speaker 6>not come out and be a fucking cock sucker like that.</v>

2398
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:30.131
<v Speaker 6>And when you do,</v>

2399
01:01:30.131 --> 01:01:31.090
<v Speaker 6>there's repercussions.</v>

2400
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:31.960
<v Speaker 6>He had to say,</v>

2401
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

2402
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.580
<v Speaker 6>it's not like it's money out of his pocket.</v>

2403
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.340
<v Speaker 6>He's probably been doing that to people his whole life,</v>

2404
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.840
<v Speaker 6>acting douchey because it puts people on their heels and it makes people easier</v>

2405
01:01:40.841 --> 01:01:42.550
<v Speaker 6>to deal with in his feeble little mind.</v>

2406
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:44.230
<v Speaker 5>All you had to do was say,</v>

2408
01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:44.741
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2409
01:01:44.741 --> 01:01:45.574
<v Speaker 5>let me get you something else.</v>

2410
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:47.343
<v Speaker 5>I mean like,</v>

2412
01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2413
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:48.821
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2414
01:01:48.821 --> 01:01:49.301
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

2415
01:01:49.301 --> 01:01:49.960
<v Speaker 5>so I was,</v>

2416
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.690
<v Speaker 5>I was welcoming all this negative energy and I just fucking stopped.</v>

2417
01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:52.931
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2418
01:01:52.931 --> 01:01:53.764
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna stop.</v>

2419
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.603
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm now at,</v>

2420
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:57.160
<v Speaker 5>and then I'm not going to Yelp and fucking thing unless I like it.</v>

2421
01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2422
01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:57.470
<v Speaker 5>y'all.</v>

2423
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:58.211
<v Speaker 5>Things like,</v>

2424
01:01:58.211 --> 01:01:58.751
<v Speaker 5>if I don't like it,</v>

2425
01:01:58.751 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna put it up there to warn people.</v>

2426
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:00.300
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2427
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 6>there's not,</v>

2428
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing wrong with telling a true good story,</v>

2429
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:03.950
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2430
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:07.100
<v Speaker 6>But what's wrong is the people that you look at their thing and they're not</v>

2431
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:07.934
<v Speaker 6>happy about it.</v>

2432
01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:08.980
<v Speaker 6>The world.</v>

2433
01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:09.101
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2434
01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:09.190
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2435
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.701
<v Speaker 5>it's people,</v>

2436
01:02:09.701 --> 01:02:10.870
<v Speaker 5>like there was a woman.</v>

2437
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:12.670
<v Speaker 5>So my wife and I are in large bond.</v>

2438
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.240
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2439
01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.910
<v Speaker 5>she's getting her hair done and I'm just walking around Larchmont to burn</v>

2440
01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:16.660
<v Speaker 5>calories.</v>

2441
01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.740
<v Speaker 5>We go into this restaurant,</v>

2442
01:02:17.741 --> 01:02:18.940
<v Speaker 5>this little Mexican place.</v>

2443
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 5>I won't say mom and pop</v>

2444
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>because that's what it looked like.</v>

2445
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Then there was like,</v>

2446
01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 2>like the cousin was working,</v>

2447
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 2>the front dad was making tortillas,</v>

2448
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.270
<v Speaker 2>moms in the back and this woman comes in and goes,</v>

2449
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 2>are you are with the large amount of business says Asian.</v>

2450
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like 11 o'clock just be my wife and the kids like I dunno man.</v>

2451
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

2452
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 2>well cause I don't frequent places that aren't with the Larchmont business</v>

2453
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 2>association because we pay to clean.</v>

2454
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Like she came in and this conti attitude,</v>

2455
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I was so offended that I was like,</v>

2456
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 2>how dare you walk in with all this negative energy and then dump it on people.</v>

2457
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened was she actually was like smiling at the end cause we</v>

2458
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 2>welcomed all her negative shit and then she left in like a good mood.</v>

2459
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>We're all fucking cunty now because she put it on us.</v>

2460
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's just because she's an unaware Douche.</v>

2462
01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 2>How could you cause that kind of term loan and leave feeling like you're in a</v>

2463
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:02.784
<v Speaker 2>good mood.</v>

2464
01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:03.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.013
<v Speaker 2>But it's</v>

2466
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 6>porn to let people know that that's gross.</v>

2467
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 6>They don't even,</v>

2468
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.830
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times those people don't even realize how gross they're band.</v>

2469
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:11.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you tell this cook and he's obviously going to feel terrible</v>

2471
01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:15.954
<v Speaker 6>about this,</v>

2472
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.280
<v Speaker 6>that shit's good for him.</v>

2473
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 6>He shouldn't be doing that.</v>

2474
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.291
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2475
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:20.070
<v Speaker 6>That's his best,</v>

2476
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:24.270
<v Speaker 6>very sensitive relationship that a person who cooks food has to the person that</v>

2477
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:25.110
<v Speaker 6>is eating that food.</v>

2478
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 6>And I'm always super nice to cooks,</v>

2479
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 6>always super nice to chefs,</v>

2480
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.980
<v Speaker 6>but if I'm ran into a guy like that,</v>

2481
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 6>I would have the same reaction.</v>

2482
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.991
<v Speaker 6>I bet that you did.</v>

2483
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:35.370
<v Speaker 6>And when you have that reaction,</v>

2484
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 6>he needs to know that he's facing that reaction because this is a direct result</v>

2485
01:03:39.091 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 6>of his behavior and that should help him evolve as a person.</v>

2486
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:42.481
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2487
01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:47.040
<v Speaker 2>there's only one of those in the city that one place has like 350 followers on</v>

2488
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:47.281
<v Speaker 2>Twitter.</v>

2489
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:47.731
<v Speaker 2>And Trust me,</v>

2490
01:03:47.731 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 2>when I say word got back like I call,</v>

2491
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>sure it's going to give back even worse now.</v>

2492
01:03:52.631 --> 01:03:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm never fucking going back there.</v>

2493
01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm on now.</v>

2494
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking the guys,</v>

2495
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.891
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2496
01:03:55.891 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Look man,</v>

2497
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:57.290
<v Speaker 2>it's good for him though.</v>

2498
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:57.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've,</v>

2499
01:03:57.771 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely been in situations where I handled hecklers incorrectly and I,</v>

2500
01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lesson and I know now know how to deal with it,</v>

2501
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2502
01:04:05.251 --> 01:04:06.540
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

2503
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2504
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.350
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

2505
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.300
<v Speaker 2>it's still a learning curve and when I do fuck up,</v>

2506
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2507
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:09.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2508
01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:11.430
<v Speaker 2>it's like I know it though.</v>

2509
01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I think comedy is one of those things where it's like dealing with the same</v>

2510
01:04:14.191 --> 01:04:14.900
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2511
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2512
01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:16.610
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about someone heckling you.</v>

2513
01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Hecklers or hackers are fucking assholes.</v>

2514
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:19.171
<v Speaker 2>Heckler,</v>

2515
01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 2>you had a question about the food because it was,</v>

2516
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.410
<v Speaker 2>it was supposed to be a mustard sauce and it was just muster.</v>

2517
01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.181
<v Speaker 2>It's just mustard.</v>

2518
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 2>It was young discussing that is just having mustard on the Turkey.</v>

2519
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I like Turkey with mustard,</v>

2520
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:30.360
<v Speaker 2>but like I need mandates to,</v>

2521
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:30.931
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2522
01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:31.764
<v Speaker 2>That's all you,</v>

2523
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I understand you just do Turkey and mustard.</v>

2524
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:34.051
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2525
01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I usually just it</v>

2526
01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:35.643
<v Speaker 6>Turkey.</v>

2527
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.320
<v Speaker 6>I like hot sauce better than mustard because I know,</v>

2528
01:04:38.321 --> 01:04:38.561
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2529
01:04:38.561 --> 01:04:39.880
<v Speaker 6>mustard is not bad for you.</v>

2530
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:40.421
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2531

<v Speaker 6>not really high caloric.</v>

2533
01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:42.730
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2534
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:43.450
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:44.530

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 6>man is not so great for.</v>

2537
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.493
<v Speaker 6>What about Serratia?</v>

2538
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:47.531
<v Speaker 6>That sounds great.</v>

2539
01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:47.770
<v Speaker 6>For it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2543
01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:52.690
<v Speaker 6>if you just want to add some flavor to something like a mayonnaise tastes so</v>

2544
01:04:52.691 --> 01:04:53.260
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

2545

01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:08.100
<v Speaker 2>hot sauce and it's not expensive.</v>

2554
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.480
<v Speaker 2>It's an expensive meal.</v>

2555
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:10.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a really reasonable meal.</v>

2556
01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that with mustard.</v>

2781
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:29.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2782
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:34.180
<v Speaker 2>He goes up to the front to go get his upgrade fucking door playing closes and</v>

2783
01:10:34.181 --> 01:10:35.770
<v Speaker 2>they fucking left him there.</v>

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:38.771
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2787
01:10:38.771 --> 01:10:39.430
<v Speaker 2>stepped down.</v>

2788
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:40.263
<v Speaker 2>He stepped out,</v>

2789
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:42.250
<v Speaker 2>door shut and they fucking left him.</v>

2790
01:10:42.251 --> 01:10:42.640
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>

2791
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they left his laptop in there too.</v>

2792
01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I said to him,</v>

2793
01:10:45.731 --> 01:10:47.170
<v Speaker 2>you need to get all your carry on off.</v>

2794
01:10:47.171 --> 01:10:48.280
<v Speaker 2>The plaintiffs are going to go talk to them.</v>

2795
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that once too?</v>

2796
01:10:49.301 --> 01:10:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Or just they've got arrested because a,</v>

2797
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:54.730
<v Speaker 2>the guy left his iPad on the plane and she took it home and he had a track my</v>

2798
01:10:54.731 --> 01:10:56.230
<v Speaker 2>iPad thing going on.</v>

2799
01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:58.203
<v Speaker 2>I'm not drinking.</v>

2800
01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.253
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2801
01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.580
<v Speaker 2>It havey if you,</v>

2802
01:11:02.581 --> 01:11:03.940
<v Speaker 2>instead of calling your kid's retarded,</v>

2803
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.040
<v Speaker 2>he caught her kids like niggers.</v>

2804
01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:06.150
<v Speaker 2>What did that end racism</v>

2805
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:08.693
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it?</v>

2806
01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:12.090
<v Speaker 2>It would make the word like mean nothing.</v>

2807
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.790
<v Speaker 2>That's an old Lenny joke from 1960.</v>

2808
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 6>Can you give me some ice because it really,</v>

2809
01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2810
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:16.840
<v Speaker 6>Yes it is.</v>

2811
01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2812
01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 6>I had a whole thing.</v>

2813
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.030
<v Speaker 6>He had a whole thing about saying it over and over again til uh,</v>

2814
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:23.310
<v Speaker 6>so it lose its meaning,</v>

2815
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.133
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>

2816
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:25.591
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2817
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:26.041
<v Speaker 6>Which is,</v>

2818
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2819
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:26.821
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2820
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:27.041
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2821
01:11:27.041 --> 01:11:28.110
<v Speaker 6>there's some argument to that,</v>

2822
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.780
<v Speaker 6>but culturally it is what it is.</v>

2823
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:31.200
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2824
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.570
<v Speaker 6>the problem with the words like that is,</v>

2825
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.351
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2826
01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 6>Logically it's a stupid thing to have one word have so much power.</v>

2827
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.730
<v Speaker 6>It's dumb to have like an upper level insult.</v>

2828
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.430
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2829
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like it shows too much power in what the human language can produce</v>

2830
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 6>as opposed to like what we should allow people to,</v>

2831
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2832
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:54.420
<v Speaker 6>to affect us by.</v>

2833
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 6>It has way too much power,</v>

2834
01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:57.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2835
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:58.080
<v Speaker 6>cause it can,</v>

2836
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 6>someone can call you anything else and it doesn't have nearly the same.</v>

2837
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:05.600
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm going to fight you thing as that and that's,</v>

2838
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.340
<v Speaker 6>that is in itself really stupid,</v>

2839
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.080
<v Speaker 6>but it's real.</v>

2840
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 6>So unfortunately it's like you got those two things to deal with.</v>

2841
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.460
<v Speaker 6>He got your,</v>

2842
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:15.590
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2843
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.790
<v Speaker 6>your objective assessment of it,</v>

2844
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:21.090
<v Speaker 6>which is like this is a stupid like why is that word so big?</v>

2845
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 6>Why is it such a big deal?</v>

2846
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2847
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.700
<v Speaker 6>isn't intent what's important and the,</v>

2848
01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 6>and niggers even crazier because black people are allowed to use it freely</v>

2849
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 6>anytime they want.</v>

2850
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:34.050
<v Speaker 6>They can just toss it back and forth and no one bats an eye but a white person.</v>

2851
01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:35.610
<v Speaker 6>Even in using it the way I did it.</v>

2852
01:12:35.611 --> 01:12:39.090
<v Speaker 6>Just saying that it is a word not calling anyone in,</v>

2853
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 6>not defining it,</v>

2854
01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 6>just saying this is the name of that word is controversial.</v>

2855
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 6>It's hilarious.</v>

2856
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 6>It's a really one of the most ridiculous aspects of our culture,</v>

2857
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:52.350
<v Speaker 6>but it is an aspect of our culture.</v>

2858
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.830
<v Speaker 6>So it's like in exposing it,</v>

2859
01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:58.950
<v Speaker 6>you got to give people the option to recognize how ridiculous it is and then</v>

2860
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 6>eventually we'll probably move past it,</v>

2861
01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 6>but we're stuck in this like swampy adolescent area,</v>

2862
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:04.990
<v Speaker 6>what was developed.</v>

2863
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:06.790
<v Speaker 5>We're still stuck there because there is a,</v>

2864
01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:11.791
<v Speaker 5>there's a large group of the population of black people who were alive when that</v>

2865
01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:15.160
<v Speaker 5>word meant a really not meant what was used.</v>

2866
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:16.123
<v Speaker 6>Me Too,</v>

2867
01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2868
01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:16.721
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2869
01:13:16.721 --> 01:13:16.961
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2870
01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:17.141
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2871
01:13:17.141 --> 01:13:17.351
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2872
01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:17.831
<v Speaker 6>I knew it was it.</v>

2873
01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:18.810
<v Speaker 6>Now someone's angry.</v>

2874
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2875
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 5>but what I'm saying is what I'm saying is there's a group of like say 50 to 70</v>

2876
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 5>year old black people where that word was very,</v>

2877
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.410
<v Speaker 5>now the the,</v>

2878
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:29.190
<v Speaker 5>I'd say the hip hop youth uses it as a term of endearment often.</v>

2879
01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:29.451
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2880
01:13:29.451 --> 01:13:34.451
<v Speaker 5>But what we're talking about is once you get to a place where maybe racism is,</v>

2881
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:35.540
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2882
01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:36.420
<v Speaker 5>is built and,</v>

2883
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2884
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 5>and we're a little past that,</v>

2885
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.391
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe then the,</v>

2886
01:13:39.391 --> 01:13:40.290
<v Speaker 5>the power from the word,</v>

2887
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.100
<v Speaker 5>the power of the word.</v>

2888
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's still people still alive that had crosses burned in the front of</v>

2889
01:13:43.471 --> 01:13:44.304
<v Speaker 5>their house.</v>

2890
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>

2891
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2892
01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.044
<v Speaker 5>that word was,</v>

2893
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:46.883
<v Speaker 5>should fear.</v>

2894
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Did he really know?</v>

2895
01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.273
<v Speaker 5>Imagine.</v>

2896
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2897
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.410
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do that to a Jewish person?</v>

2898
01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:55.811
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2899
01:13:55.811 --> 01:13:56.710
<v Speaker 6>have you heard this?</v>

2900
01:13:56.711 --> 01:13:58.120
<v Speaker 6>A Phil Ivy Story?</v>

2901
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.000
<v Speaker 6>Do you know about the story of Phil Ivey got,</v>

2902
01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:00.880
<v Speaker 6>looks like tiger woods.</v>

2903
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.860
<v Speaker 6>Phil Ivey is the guy that looks like tiger woods.</v>

2904
01:14:02.861 --> 01:14:06.430
<v Speaker 6>He's apparently the best poker player on earth.</v>

2905
01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:07.990
<v Speaker 6>And this gentleman,</v>

2906
01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:08.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2907
01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:13.860
<v Speaker 6>went to a British casino and he won $11 million,</v>

2908
01:14:14.511 --> 01:14:19.511
<v Speaker 6>11 point $9 million in one spectacular run of a game called Punto Blanco.</v>

2909
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:22.160
<v Speaker 6>It's a buck or rock game.</v>

2910
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:23.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't really know how that,</v>

2911
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.433
<v Speaker 6>how that goes,</v>

2912
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:29.710
<v Speaker 6>but he is charged with observing tiny flaws in the games card and then using</v>

2913
01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:33.890
<v Speaker 6>that knowledge to give,</v>

2914
01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.900
<v Speaker 6>give the house a severe thrashing.</v>

2915
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.850
<v Speaker 6>He one's like all this money.</v>

2916
01:14:37.851 --> 01:14:42.410
<v Speaker 6>When he was down at one point $770,000 he was down.</v>

2917
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.840
<v Speaker 2>So he noticed that there was a mark in the cards.</v>

2918
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 2>This is the what the casino saying alleging fucked up because he knows the</v>

2919
01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:51.110
<v Speaker 2>legend deck game.</v>

2920
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:54.200
<v Speaker 6>I do not know anything about this game.</v>

2921
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:56.060
<v Speaker 6>I know zero about this game,</v>

2922
01:14:56.061 --> 01:14:59.960
<v Speaker 6>but I do know that one of the things that they're saying is that he talked the</v>

2923
01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:01.760
<v Speaker 6>dealer into not changing the deck.</v>

2924
01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.510
<v Speaker 6>What stupid that they let them do that.</v>

2925
01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:05.751
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2926
01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.570
<v Speaker 6>This should never would never flied in Vegas.</v>

2927
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:09.151
<v Speaker 6>They would,</v>

2928
01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:09.230
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2929
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:10.450
<v Speaker 6>they would have moved in and going,</v>

2930
01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.270
<v Speaker 6>what's going on here?</v>

2931
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:12.380
<v Speaker 6>How come you haven't changed that deck?</v>

2932
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2933
01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.380
<v Speaker 6>Like people have developed,</v>

2934
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:16.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2935
01:15:16.101 --> 01:15:20.000
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of methods of counting cards and they've developed,</v>

2936
01:15:20.001 --> 01:15:22.930
<v Speaker 6>developed all these methods of like trying to like control and,</v>

2937
01:15:22.931 --> 01:15:23.161
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2938
01:15:23.161 --> 01:15:23.471
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2939
01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:27.890
<v Speaker 6>and make rational choices about what's the next car going to be.</v>

2940
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.870
<v Speaker 6>So then they figured out how to mitigate that.</v>

2941
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:31.380
<v Speaker 6>They just bring an extra cards.</v>

2942
01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.420
<v Speaker 6>It put an extra decks.</v>

2943
01:15:32.421 --> 01:15:33.290
<v Speaker 6>They throw it all together.</v>

2944
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.153
<v Speaker 6>It's the dealers.</v>

2945
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.073
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2946
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.431
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

2947
01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:35.960
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2948
01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.580
<v Speaker 6>apparently so it got this guy got up to some insane amount per bet.</v>

2949
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 6>He started at $77,000 per hand and then he raised it with the casinos blessing</v>

2950
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.600
<v Speaker 6>up to $230,000 per hand.</v>

2951
01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.190
<v Speaker 6>Wow Dude.</v>

2952
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:56.910
<v Speaker 6>Stop and think about that cause I was playing 230 and it's apparently again it's</v>

2953
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.970
<v Speaker 6>very similar to um,</v>

2954
01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:04.190
<v Speaker 6>it's very similar to black jack and and like the odds and how you win and lose.</v>

2955
01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.130
<v Speaker 6>Like sometimes people do well and sometimes people crash and burn,</v>

2956
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.110
<v Speaker 6>but he apparently just pounded on them and they don't want to give him the</v>

2957
01:16:12.111 --> 01:16:12.650
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

2958
01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:17.650
<v Speaker 6>But I say like if the guy was down $770,000</v>

2959
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.680
<v Speaker 2>one again,</v>

2960
01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:25.050
<v Speaker 6>and what kind of a a an advantage does he really have?</v>

2961
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:26.303
<v Speaker 6>You know what,</v>

2962
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.410
<v Speaker 6>how come you fucked up then</v>

2963
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.630
<v Speaker 2>going on monies.</v>

2964
01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Monies not even real to him.</v>

2965
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 2>See what's making it look realistic.</v>

2966
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I better used to go down for the next five hands,</v>

2967
01:16:35.681 --> 01:16:36.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2968
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:37.083
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would do.</v>

2969
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good one of the 11.9.</v>

2970
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:40.920
<v Speaker 2>He might have that advantage where he can be like,</v>

2971
01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.250
<v Speaker 6>that is a very good point.</v>

2972
01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:44.120
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2973
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:44.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2974
01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:46.670
<v Speaker 6>that's a big move with pool players,</v>

2975
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:48.110
<v Speaker 6>but that's a move.</v>

2976
01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:48.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>

2977
01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:49.550
<v Speaker 6>To rake you in.</v>

2978
01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:49.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2979
01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:50.930
<v Speaker 6>it's a classic move you,</v>

2980
01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.340
<v Speaker 6>it's from the movie the Hustler.</v>

2981
01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:55.800
<v Speaker 6>When Forrest Whitaker place Paul Newman and he acts like a,</v>

2982
01:16:55.801 --> 01:16:56.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2983
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.160
<v Speaker 6>like a mental patient when he first meets him,</v>

2984
01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.160
<v Speaker 6>he tells him that they did all experiments on them and shit like that.</v>

2985
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.900
<v Speaker 6>And then as the game gets better,</v>

2986
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:04.120
<v Speaker 6>they kept forced,</v>

2987
01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:05.900
<v Speaker 6>pays him for a bit at first,</v>

2988
01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.180
<v Speaker 6>and then he starts playing really fucking good.</v>

2989
01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 6>And he,</v>

2990
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 6>that Paul Newman by this time is drunk and he's losing all of his money.</v>

2991
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 6>And at the end he bought to give him the money.</v>

2992
01:17:15.681 --> 01:17:16.120
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

2993
01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 6>are you a Hustler Amos?</v>

2994
01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.470
<v Speaker 6>Are you a hustler?</v>

2995
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:19.020
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

2996
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:19.791
<v Speaker 6>he'll have to pay me,</v>

2997
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:20.624
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2998
01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 6>It's cool.</v>

2999
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.531
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3000
01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 6>I wanted no bad feelings.</v>

3001
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:23.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3002
01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:26.401
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3003
01:17:26.401 --> 01:17:30.270
<v Speaker 6>But playing on people's Egos in a pool game is very different than a card game.</v>

3004
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.220
<v Speaker 6>There's no playing on the egos here.</v>

3005
01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:33.091
<v Speaker 5>We did that.</v>

3006
01:17:33.091 --> 01:17:36.570
<v Speaker 5>I told you about why you dump me and my buddy did that in a um,</v>

3007
01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:38.040
<v Speaker 5>in upstate New York.</v>

3008
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:39.210
<v Speaker 5>Didn't hustle people.</v>

3009
01:17:39.211 --> 01:17:40.110
<v Speaker 5>We were playing this game.</v>

3010
01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 5>I think I told you about it.</v>

3011
01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:42.450
<v Speaker 5>We put two balls in each pocket,</v>

3012
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:43.703
<v Speaker 5>back to back,</v>

3013
01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:46.980
<v Speaker 5>three balls in the center and then you get a cue ball to the guy and you say,</v>

3014
01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:47.371
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3015
01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:48.510
<v Speaker 5>it's five bucks to buy.</v>

3016
01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.051
<v Speaker 5>If you win,</v>

3017
01:17:49.051 --> 01:17:49.890
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you 50.</v>

3018
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.450
<v Speaker 5>You've got to run the table.</v>

3019
01:17:51.451 --> 01:17:52.320
<v Speaker 5>You can't miss a shot.</v>

3020
01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:53.843
<v Speaker 5>And it's him.</v>

3021
01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.080
<v Speaker 5>It's only four balls.</v>

3022
01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:55.440
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3023
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.060
<v Speaker 5>there's every ball on the table too.</v>

3024
01:17:57.061 --> 01:17:59.650
<v Speaker 5>And each pocket you have to shoot two in each box.</v>

3025
01:17:59.670 --> 01:17:59.971
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3026
01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:00.570
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3027
01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:01.351
<v Speaker 5>I set it up like this.</v>

3028
01:18:01.351 --> 01:18:03.090
<v Speaker 5>I put two back to back in this pocket.</v>

3029
01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.320
<v Speaker 5>How many balls are on the table?</v>

3030
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.150
<v Speaker 5>Every single box.</v>

3031
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:06.000
<v Speaker 5>Every 15 balls.</v>

3032
01:18:06.001 --> 01:18:06.481
<v Speaker 5>15 balls,</v>

3033
01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:07.141
<v Speaker 5>three in the center,</v>

3034
01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:08.070
<v Speaker 5>two in each pocket.</v>

3035
01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.090
<v Speaker 5>And I give them the cue ball.</v>

3036
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.141
<v Speaker 5>Three in the center,</v>

3037
01:18:10.141 --> 01:18:11.280
<v Speaker 5>like lined up in the center.</v>

3038
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.810
<v Speaker 6>Do you want him to run them in order or any order?</v>

3039
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 5>All you gotta do is not miss.</v>

3040
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 5>Just run the table.</v>

3041
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.570
<v Speaker 5>It's really difficult.</v>

3042
01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:20.600
<v Speaker 5>It's difficult for an average pool player mean probably you could probably do</v>

3043
01:18:20.601 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3044
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.360
<v Speaker 6>It just depends on if the balls are broken.</v>

3045
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 6>If the balls are broken and there's no clusters,</v>

3046
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:26.411
<v Speaker 6>there's what?</v>

3047
01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:27.500
<v Speaker 6>What keeps you from running out?</v>

3048
01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:28.330
<v Speaker 6>It's clusters.</v>

3049
01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:29.021
<v Speaker 5>So it's like this.</v>

3050
01:18:29.021 --> 01:18:29.650
<v Speaker 5>It's like this.</v>

3051
01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:30.830
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3052
01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.050
<v Speaker 5>like this is the pocket.</v>

3053
01:18:32.051 --> 01:18:33.310
<v Speaker 5>There's two balls like this,</v>

3054
01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:33.610
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3055
01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:34.061
<v Speaker 5>Does the pocket,</v>

3056
01:18:34.061 --> 01:18:34.990
<v Speaker 5>there's two balls like this.</v>

3057
01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:36.040
<v Speaker 5>There's two balls like this.</v>

3058
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.371
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3059
01:18:36.371 --> 01:18:40.270
<v Speaker 5>No one knows you're sitting on it and then there's three in the center I think</v>

3060
01:18:40.271 --> 01:18:40.450
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3061
01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.170
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3062
01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:45.820
<v Speaker 5>so what the thing is is what will happen is if you play with intent and you just</v>

3063
01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:48.280
<v Speaker 5>try to tap 'em in and move your ball,</v>

3064
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.540
<v Speaker 5>move the cue ball to the next one in,</v>

3065
01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:50.380
<v Speaker 5>line up your next shot,</v>

3066
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:51.071
<v Speaker 5>you'll do it.</v>

3067
01:18:51.071 --> 01:18:54.910
<v Speaker 5>What happens is you're going to get left with like three balls on the table with</v>

3068
01:18:54.911 --> 01:18:56.380
<v Speaker 5>a couple long odd shots.</v>

3069
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.390
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like wind.</v>

3070
01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.380
<v Speaker 6>That's a soccer game.</v>

3071
01:18:58.450 --> 01:18:59.800
<v Speaker 6>It definitely was.</v>

3072
01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.790
<v Speaker 6>You're only saying that you're going to get left with those odd shots.</v>

3073
01:19:02.791 --> 01:19:03.970
<v Speaker 6>We don't know how to play it.</v>

3074
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.943
<v Speaker 6>The majority.</v>

3075
01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:06.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3076
01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:06.901
<v Speaker 6>but that's,</v>

3077
01:19:06.901 --> 01:19:08.310
<v Speaker 6>why would they be playing that?</v>

3078
01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:10.560
<v Speaker 6>Because it seems it looks so easy.</v>

3079
01:19:10.561 --> 01:19:12.750
<v Speaker 6>Me and my buddy easy to run 15 balls.</v>

3080
01:19:12.751 --> 01:19:13.584
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking hard.</v>

3081
01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.240
<v Speaker 6>It's if you ever play straight pool,</v>

3082
01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:16.200
<v Speaker 6>straight pools,</v>

3083
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.320
<v Speaker 6>essentially the godfather of all pools and with street food,</v>

3084
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:21.750
<v Speaker 6>it's also called 14 one continuous.</v>

3085
01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:25.260
<v Speaker 6>That was what they used to play back in the old days when the gentleman gamblers</v>

3086
01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.370
<v Speaker 6>of like the Hustler era,</v>

3087
01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:29.400
<v Speaker 6>they'd play for thousands and thousands of dollars in play street pool.</v>

3088
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.390
<v Speaker 6>That was a man's game.</v>

3089
01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:32.430
<v Speaker 6>And with straight pool is every ball.</v>

3090
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:32.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3091
01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:36.750
<v Speaker 6>You call every single shot and every ball you,</v>

3092
01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.420
<v Speaker 6>you can choose any dang stripes are solids,</v>

3093
01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:43.080
<v Speaker 6>but at you leave one ball left and you shoot that ball in and the cue ball</v>

3094
01:19:43.081 --> 01:19:44.790
<v Speaker 6>smashes the rack and you continue gun.</v>

3095
01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.670
<v Speaker 6>And there's guys that have run hundreds of hundreds of balls.</v>

3096
01:19:47.671 --> 01:19:48.481
<v Speaker 6>Like my friend Max,</v>

3097
01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:50.070
<v Speaker 6>I believe he's run 200 balls.</v>

3098
01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.330
<v Speaker 6>That's like a big number.</v>

3099
01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:51.801
<v Speaker 6>Like run out.</v>

3100
01:19:51.801 --> 01:19:52.920
<v Speaker 6>I've never run a hundred balls,</v>

3101
01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:55.740
<v Speaker 6>but a hundred balls is like when you were a legit straight pool player.</v>

3102
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3103
01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:56.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3104
01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:56.821
<v Speaker 6>I've never,</v>

3105
01:19:56.821 --> 01:19:58.800
<v Speaker 6>I think I've run like 50 maybe more,</v>

3106
01:19:58.801 --> 01:19:59.634
<v Speaker 6>maybe a little more,</v>

3107
01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:00.550
<v Speaker 6>but that's about it.</v>

3108
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 6>I haven't played</v>

3109
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.753
<v Speaker 5>in so long.</v>

3110
01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.160
<v Speaker 5>I used to be really good.</v>

3111
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.380
<v Speaker 5>So Eddie and I did this in part in New York.</v>

3112
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.921
<v Speaker 5>We needed money.</v>

3113
01:20:05.921 --> 01:20:08.850
<v Speaker 5>We were broke and so just started saying,</v>

3114
01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:09.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3115
01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 5>we line up the table and some guys,</v>

3116
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:10.681
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing and go,</v>

3117
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:10.721
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3118
01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:11.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to try it.</v>

3119
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.990
<v Speaker 5>We've known each other five bucks to buy in,</v>

3120
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 5>would buy him for five and couldn't do it.</v>

3121
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't do it.</v>

3122
01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.860
<v Speaker 5>Then he'd bring his friends over.</v>

3123
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't do it was definitely a hustle.</v>

3124
01:20:19.051 --> 01:20:19.381
<v Speaker 5>Here's the,</v>

3125
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 5>here's the rub is that we couldn't do it either.</v>

3126
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 5>Like it was hard to do for us.</v>

3127
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.910
<v Speaker 6>That's a way to make money.</v>

3128
01:20:23.911 --> 01:20:24.691
<v Speaker 6>If you're a pool player,</v>

3129
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 6>it's a better guy that he can't do it because this is most likely not going to</v>

3130
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:28.141
<v Speaker 6>do it that way.</v>

3131
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:29.310
<v Speaker 6>You don't even have to play him.</v>

3132
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:30.211
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3133
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:31.080
<v Speaker 6>That's what guys do.</v>

3134
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:32.520
<v Speaker 6>That's called playing the ghost,</v>

3135
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:33.870
<v Speaker 6>but playing the ghost,</v>

3136
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 6>you get to break and then you get ball in hand and most people lose.</v>

3137
01:20:36.841 --> 01:20:37.674
<v Speaker 6>To the ghost.</v>

3138
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 6>The ghost is like say if you wanted to play.</v>

3139
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:40.350
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3140
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.580
<v Speaker 6>it's a good way to practice too.</v>

3141
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 6>He'd say you're going to play a race to 10.</v>

3142
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:44.941
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3143
01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:48.210
<v Speaker 6>And Raisa 10 for like 1000 bucks and you're going to play the ghost.</v>

3144
01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:49.830
<v Speaker 6>That would mean only your playing.</v>

3145
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 6>You break the balls and then you get ball in hand and then from there you try to</v>

3146
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 6>run out.</v>

3147
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 6>If you don't run out,</v>

3148
01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:56.351
<v Speaker 6>you lose.</v>

3149
01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.240
<v Speaker 6>And the ghost wins.</v>

3150
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.433
<v Speaker 6>She goes to ghost.</v>

3151
01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:00.570
<v Speaker 6>You gotta assume that every time you missed the ghost runs out.</v>

3152
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3153
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 6>So you break and run out every game and most people lose to the ghost.</v>

3154
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 6>Nine ball or April 10 ball.</v>

3155
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 6>10 Ball.</v>

3156
01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3157
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:06.960
<v Speaker 6>10 balls.</v>

3158
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.381
<v Speaker 6>10 balls,</v>

3159
01:21:07.381 --> 01:21:08.071
<v Speaker 6>like nine ball.</v>

3160
01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:09.000
<v Speaker 6>But it has an extra ball.</v>

3161
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:11.183
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3162
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:12.160
<v Speaker 5>it's an,</v>

3163
01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.240
<v Speaker 5>it's an rotation game.</v>

3164
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:14.460
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>

3165
01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.271
<v Speaker 6>It's a rotation game,</v>

3166
01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:15.851
<v Speaker 6>meaning you,</v>

3167
01:21:15.851 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 6>you shoot balls one through 10 and you have to make contact with the lowest</v>

3168
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:20.371
<v Speaker 6>number of rack,</v>

3169
01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:21.060
<v Speaker 6>10 balls,</v>

3170
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 6>you rack them like a mini eight ball rack.</v>

3171
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.113
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3172
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3173
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:25.081
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3174
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:25.680
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3175
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.940
<v Speaker 5>that is fascinating.</v>

3176
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.800
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3177
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 5>I used to love,</v>

3178
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 5>we had a pool table in her house for a couple of years in college and that's all</v>

3179
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:32.634
<v Speaker 5>we did.</v>

3180
01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.520
<v Speaker 6>That like what you're doing is like,</v>

3181
01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:37.220
<v Speaker 6>it's a really smart thing to do because you don't have any,</v>

3182
01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:38.241
<v Speaker 6>when you want,</v>

3183
01:21:38.241 --> 01:21:39.470
<v Speaker 6>where you want to do with a person.</v>

3184
01:21:39.471 --> 01:21:41.900
<v Speaker 6>If you're playing pool with them and she want to get them to shoot,</v>

3185
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.640
<v Speaker 6>if you can get them to shoot,</v>

3186
01:21:43.641 --> 01:21:44.474
<v Speaker 6>you can win.</v>

3187
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:46.790
<v Speaker 6>And if you can get them to shoot playing the ghost,</v>

3188
01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:47.420
<v Speaker 6>you can win.</v>

3189
01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:47.750
<v Speaker 6>You can,</v>

3190
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:48.140
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>

3191
01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.090
<v Speaker 6>you can find a way to win as long as they're shooting.</v>

3192
01:21:50.091 --> 01:21:51.020
<v Speaker 6>But when you're shooting</v>

3193
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:52.021
<v Speaker 5>that can lose.</v>

3194
01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:54.450
<v Speaker 5>That's where we got caught speaking loose as soon as it was.</v>

3195
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 5>These guys were,</v>

3196
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.760
<v Speaker 5>these guys were cool and we ended up going to a horse track with them the next</v>

3197
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

3198
01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 5>But they were playing over and over again and they were getting pissed because</v>

3199
01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 5>you get real close but you get close,</v>

3200
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:09.150
<v Speaker 5>you got like three balls left and they're just odd shots and it's a wide open</v>

3201
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:09.421
<v Speaker 5>table.</v>

3202
01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:12.360
<v Speaker 5>Now 15 balls is a lot of balls to run.</v>

3203
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.040
<v Speaker 5>But it looks don't simple.</v>

3204
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.923
<v Speaker 5>The only for idiots.</v>

3205
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:15.120
<v Speaker 5>Yup,</v>

3206
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:15.953
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3207
01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:17.310
<v Speaker 5>So then they said,</v>

3208
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.593
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>

3209
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.493
<v Speaker 5>this can't be done.</v>

3210
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3211
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.113
<v Speaker 5>it can be done.</v>

3212
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:21.910
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

3213
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:22.120
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3214
01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.220
<v Speaker 5>everything is possible.</v>

3215
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it and we tell them at the beginning it's a very hard,</v>

3216
01:22:25.321 --> 01:22:29.010
<v Speaker 5>didn't see that's when you need a pro player right next to him who just runs</v>

3217
01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:29.844
<v Speaker 5>those balls out.</v>

3218
01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 5>It makes it look easy.</v>

3219
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:31.411
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

3220
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:32.610
<v Speaker 5>And then that you did it,</v>

3221
01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:33.000
<v Speaker 5>did it.</v>

3222
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:33.661
<v Speaker 5>And let me tell you something.</v>

3223
01:22:33.661 --> 01:22:36.710
<v Speaker 5>I did it done it maybe four times total in my life because we used to do this in</v>

3224
01:22:36.711 --> 01:22:38.730
<v Speaker 5>the in our fraternity house all the time and I fucking did it.</v>

3225
01:22:38.731 --> 01:22:39.080
<v Speaker 5>And the guy,</v>

3226
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:39.511
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3227
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:39.841
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3228
01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:40.140
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3229
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:40.511
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you.</v>

3230
01:22:40.511 --> 01:22:40.831
<v Speaker 5>I'll watch.</v>

3231
01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:41.664
<v Speaker 5>Let me show you how it's done.</v>

3232
01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 5>It's very simple,</v>

3233
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3234
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.010
<v Speaker 5>Start off with a ball in the center,</v>

3235
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:46.290
<v Speaker 5>run one to the side pocket and tap,</v>

3236
01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:46.621
<v Speaker 5>tap.</v>

3237
01:22:46.621 --> 01:22:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Leave it right up against the other ball.</v>

3238
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:49.110
<v Speaker 5>Then come back the other direction.</v>

3239
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:50.970
<v Speaker 5>A little descriptive for this imaginary game.</v>

3240
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:52.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not really even happening,</v>

3241
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:53.730
<v Speaker 5>but you're doing commentary and a game.</v>

3242
01:22:53.731 --> 01:22:54.600
<v Speaker 5>And going out of your head.</v>

3243
01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:55.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3244
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:55.351
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3245
01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:55.981
<v Speaker 5>but I did it.</v>

3246
01:22:55.981 --> 01:22:57.810
<v Speaker 5>I ended up running the table and they were like,</v>

3247
01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:58.620
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

3248
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:00.870
<v Speaker 5>And then we had him for another fucking 10 rounds because they were like,</v>

3249
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:01.321
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3250
01:23:01.321 --> 01:23:01.921
<v Speaker 5>now I gotta fuck.</v>

3251
01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:02.790
<v Speaker 5>Now I know how it's done.</v>

3252
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:03.241
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

3253
01:23:03.241 --> 01:23:04.560
<v Speaker 5>that seems like a good hustle.</v>

3254
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860
<v Speaker 5>If one's going to steal that,</v>

3255
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 5>they're going</v>

3256
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.190
<v Speaker 6>to call that the machine hustle.</v>

3257
01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:10.290
<v Speaker 6>That's the new machine hustle.</v>

3258
01:23:10.291 --> 01:23:11.530
<v Speaker 6>That's a good hustle by the way.</v>

3259
01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.340
<v Speaker 6>It's a great hustle.</v>

3260
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.620
<v Speaker 6>It's a good hustle and you should even let the guy break.</v>

3261
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:15.543
<v Speaker 6>Let a guy break.</v>

3262
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 6>Cause especially if by the way,</v>

3263
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:18.640
<v Speaker 6>15 balls,</v>

3264
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:20.680
<v Speaker 6>even if you get to shoot every ball,</v>

3265
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:22.330
<v Speaker 6>whenever we want stripes or solids,</v>

3266
01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:24.580
<v Speaker 6>you still have an issue with balls clustering up.</v>

3267
01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.800
<v Speaker 6>Most people do not know how to break that up.</v>

3268
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 6>You don't know how to plan for it.</v>

3269
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:29.260
<v Speaker 6>You don't know how to do it.</v>

3270
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.881
<v Speaker 6>You're not.</v>

3271
01:23:29.881 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 6>You're going to get stuck where you got no shot.</v>

3272
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:34.150
<v Speaker 6>That's the odds are much higher.</v>

3273
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:35.560
<v Speaker 6>Like that's a real sucker bet.</v>

3274
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:36.910
<v Speaker 6>The right way to do that.</v>

3275
01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.380
<v Speaker 6>You should have like five to one on the money.</v>

3276
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 6>That's where someone should be saying like you should have to give up five to</v>

3277
01:23:41.861 --> 01:23:45.910
<v Speaker 6>ever one that they gather and then they play that you gave them 10 to one.</v>

3278
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:47.750
<v Speaker 5>We said if you hit when we'll give you 50 bucks,</v>

3279
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:48.980
<v Speaker 5>it'd be five to buy in.</v>

3280
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:50.020
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3281
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.110
<v Speaker 5>That was how you were doing.</v>

3282
01:23:51.111 --> 01:23:51.471
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3283
01:23:51.471 --> 01:23:51.661
<v Speaker 5>That will,</v>

3284
01:23:51.661 --> 01:23:51.890
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3285
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:52.820
<v Speaker 5>that's even different.</v>

3286
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:53.830
<v Speaker 5>I learned it in Russia.</v>

3287
01:23:53.831 --> 01:23:54.321
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3288
01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:55.250
<v Speaker 5>it was seven to one.</v>

3289
01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.500
<v Speaker 5>So seven one five buck by and you walk away with 35 and it was straight pool.</v>

3290
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:00.750
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

3291
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.570
<v Speaker 5>this sees a long time to make money though.</v>

3292
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Straight fuels one of them.</v>

3293
01:24:03.921 --> 01:24:04.310
<v Speaker 5>You're fine.</v>

3294
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.431
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

3295
01:24:04.431 --> 01:24:04.551
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

3296
01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:04.671
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>

3297
01:24:04.671 --> 01:24:05.211
<v Speaker 5>Let me take that back.</v>

3298
01:24:05.211 --> 01:24:05.901
<v Speaker 5>Let me take that back.</v>

3299
01:24:05.901 --> 01:24:06.734
<v Speaker 5>Gets out.</v>

3300
01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:07.820
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

3301
01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:08.653
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

3302
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.950
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

3303
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:10.783
<v Speaker 5>I take that back.</v>

3304
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.890
<v Speaker 5>I think this is what it was third,</v>

3305
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:13.680
<v Speaker 5>cause it's all,</v>

3306
01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm coming to you for facts no matter what from now on fucking,</v>

3307
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:19.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm so unreliable.</v>

3308
01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:24.480
<v Speaker 5>It was straight pool slop counted and it you gotta you gotta uh,</v>

3309
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:26.150
<v Speaker 5>a dollar percentage.</v>

3310
01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.370
<v Speaker 5>Every time you sunk a ball for every ball you got,</v>

3311
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:29.660
<v Speaker 5>it was $35 to buy in.</v>

3312
01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:32.430
<v Speaker 5>And then everything over that you got to keep and,</v>

3313
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:35.120
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't realize the first time I played I was calling shots and I was with,</v>

3314
01:24:35.121 --> 01:24:38.330
<v Speaker 5>my dad got Igor and he was watching me and I was calling shots and he's like,</v>

3315
01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.700
<v Speaker 5>you don't need to call the shots when you were playing in Russia,</v>

3316
01:24:40.730 --> 01:24:41.061
<v Speaker 5>in Russia,</v>

3317
01:24:41.061 --> 01:24:41.900
<v Speaker 5>when I was in Russia,</v>

3318
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.880
<v Speaker 5>we went to a,</v>

3319
01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.180
<v Speaker 5>they have a different game over there,</v>

3320
01:24:44.181 --> 01:24:44.391
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3321
01:24:44.391 --> 01:24:45.590
<v Speaker 5>They have Russian billiards.</v>

3322
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:47.630
<v Speaker 5>It was a huge fucking table.</v>

3323
01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.740
<v Speaker 5>Huge table.</v>

3324
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it was more than,</v>

3325
01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:50.810
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it was more balls,</v>

3326
01:24:50.811 --> 01:24:51.800
<v Speaker 5>but it was basically,</v>

3327
01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.000
<v Speaker 5>it was straight pool.</v>

3328
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.701
<v Speaker 5>Now that you said it,</v>

3329
01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:54.750
<v Speaker 5>I'd never played the game before.</v>

3330
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.540
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I'm wrong because I thought they'd mostly played like Russian billiards</v>

3331
01:24:59.541 --> 01:24:59.871
<v Speaker 6>over there,</v>

3332
01:24:59.871 --> 01:25:00.980
<v Speaker 6>but I've never been there.</v>

3333
01:25:00.981 --> 01:25:01.180
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

3334
01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:01.770
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

3335
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:02.100
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3336
01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.390
<v Speaker 5>it was one huge table.</v>

3337
01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.530
<v Speaker 5>They have a different game though,</v>

3338
01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.693
<v Speaker 5>and it was just,</v>

3339
01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.860
<v Speaker 5>and it was like you buy in against the house,</v>

3340
01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:12.420
<v Speaker 5>you buy a dollar percentage and then every ball you hit in,</v>

3341
01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.100
<v Speaker 5>you earn a dollar percentage back.</v>

3342
01:25:14.101 --> 01:25:15.330
<v Speaker 5>So it's like every ball is worth five bucks.</v>

3343
01:25:15.331 --> 01:25:16.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm giving you a numbers,</v>

3344
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.670
<v Speaker 5>it's $35 to buy in.</v>

3345
01:25:17.671 --> 01:25:18.720
<v Speaker 5>Every is worth five bucks.</v>

3346
01:25:18.721 --> 01:25:19.211
<v Speaker 5>So if you six,</v>

3347
01:25:19.211 --> 01:25:20.044
<v Speaker 5>seven balls,</v>

3348
01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:20.640
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3349
01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.211
<v Speaker 5>you're in the break.</v>

3350
01:25:21.211 --> 01:25:22.680
<v Speaker 5>And then if you run the rest of the table,</v>

3351
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.250
<v Speaker 5>you do it.</v>

3352
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:24.840
<v Speaker 5>So we do you get extra money.</v>

3353
01:25:24.841 --> 01:25:26.100
<v Speaker 5>So the first time we did it,</v>

3354
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:27.870
<v Speaker 5>I was calling shots and,</v>

3355
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.130
<v Speaker 5>and I missed,</v>

3356
01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.113
<v Speaker 5>I lost my money.</v>

3357
01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:30.901
<v Speaker 5>The other guy went in,</v>

3358
01:25:30.901 --> 01:25:31.560
<v Speaker 5>he was the,</v>

3359
01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.760
<v Speaker 5>the guy that worked there who did this against everyone and he started fucking</v>

3360
01:25:35.761 --> 01:25:36.570
<v Speaker 5>running the table,</v>

3361
01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:37.740
<v Speaker 5>but he slopped counted.</v>

3362
01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:39.360
<v Speaker 5>He didn't have to call any fucking shots.</v>

3363
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.260
<v Speaker 5>So I said to Igor,</v>

3364
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:40.800
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3365
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.190
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

3366
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:42.090
<v Speaker 5>You can just fucking,</v>

3367
01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.021
<v Speaker 5>he was doing those,</v>

3368
01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:43.171
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3369
01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:46.380
<v Speaker 5>when you run the pool cue through and it's just out ball start running</v>

3370
01:25:46.381 --> 01:25:47.214
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

3371
01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.233
<v Speaker 5>He was doing that.</v>

3372
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:50.011
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

3373
01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:50.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3374
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.300
<v Speaker 5>I said to you where I go,</v>

3375
01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:52.080
<v Speaker 5>that's bullshit.</v>

3376
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:52.740
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

3377
01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:52.911
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3378
01:25:52.911 --> 01:25:53.551
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to call him.</v>

3379
01:25:53.551 --> 01:25:54.384
<v Speaker 5>He just had a men.</v>

3380
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:55.260
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

3381
01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:55.940
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck.</v>

3382
01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.260
<v Speaker 6>Is this the game that you saw?</v>

3383
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.680
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3384
01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.820
<v Speaker 6>it's Russian billiards.</v>

3385
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.030
<v Speaker 6>It looks like it's a sneaker table and they're all white balls.</v>

3386
01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 6>It was probably drunk and it was</v>

3387
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 2>like 1520 years ago.</v>

3388
01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:06.771
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3389
01:26:06.771 --> 01:26:07.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember?</v>

3390
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.061
<v Speaker 2>I may have a,</v>

3391
01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:09.140
<v Speaker 2>they have a weird game,</v>

3392
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 2>but they may have been</v>

3393
01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.220
<v Speaker 1>play over there.</v>

3394
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like pool on a snooker table with big balls and all the balls are white.</v>

3395
01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:16.631
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

3396
01:26:16.631 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3397
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Is it straight pool where you just run the table?</v>

3398
01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:19.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

3399
01:26:19.781 --> 01:26:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about the rules of Russian billiards,</v>

3400
01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but Russians is just such a strange group of white people.</v>

3401
01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:28.870
<v Speaker 1>They're the strangest motherfuckers man.</v>

3402
01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:33.580
<v Speaker 2>But the point of the point of the ego story is I started really like hamming it</v>

3403
01:26:33.581 --> 01:26:36.670
<v Speaker 2>up and doing the Tom Cruise from color of money.</v>

3404
01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Samurai chops with the pool cue did.</v>

3405
01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:26:39.041 --> 01:26:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I was like really fucking to spend that or pull me aside.</v>

3407
01:26:41.981 --> 01:26:42.281
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3408
01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:43.300
<v Speaker 2>time to start losing.</v>

3409
01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:43.811
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3410
01:26:43.811 --> 01:26:44.110
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3411
01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:48.010
<v Speaker 2>And I realize I'm winning money at a bar with a bunch of fucking gangsters.</v>

3412
01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3413
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:49.181
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

3414
01:26:49.181 --> 01:26:49.810
<v Speaker 2>just lose.</v>

3415
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:50.291
<v Speaker 2>Just lose them.</v>

3416
01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:51.124
<v Speaker 2>Let's go home.</v>

3417
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3418
01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.713
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

3419
01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.440
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

3420
01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.273
<v Speaker 2>All my money.</v>

3421
01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you got to lose to walk out and win because they,</v>

3422
01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:57.940
<v Speaker 2>what are you?</v>

3423
01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.181
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3424
01:26:58.181 --> 01:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to bring over to the tech to you.</v>

3425
01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:01.140
<v Speaker 2>You've got a bunch of fucking cat rubles in your pocket.</v>

3426
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.620
<v Speaker 2>You're walking out like a fucking lot American.</v>

3427
01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:03.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3428
01:27:03.521 --> 01:27:07.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be doing it like I'm fucking Tom Cruise.</v>

3429
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Such a pain.</v>

3430
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I was drunk when he too.</v>

3431
01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I would never go with you to another country.</v>

3432
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh fucking come on.</v>

3433
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>

3434
01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I would be a blast up until the point where we get shot.</v>

3435
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.780
<v Speaker 2>That guy doesn't exist anymore.</v>

3436
01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a bag over.</v>

3437
01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Our heads were in the back of a truck bounce around through the desert.</v>

3438
01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:24.641
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3439
01:27:24.641 --> 01:27:25.474
<v Speaker 2>can you hear me?</v>

3440
01:27:26.050 --> 01:27:27.040
<v Speaker 2>You're chokes.</v>

3441
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Fucking sock.</v>

3442
01:27:28.181 --> 01:27:29.590
<v Speaker 2>We stopped with that shit.</v>

3443
01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:32.950
<v Speaker 2>You fucked with those people in a truck.</v>

3444
01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:35.590
<v Speaker 2>So this Phil Ivey</v>

3445
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Ivy game.</v>

3446
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was the same game that a James Bond played.</v>

3447
01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Punto Blanco Bonko bonkers.</v>

3448
01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:42.533
<v Speaker 1>It's like white horse.</v>

3449
01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a sister game of oh,</v>

3450
01:27:44.591 --> 01:27:44.861
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3451
01:27:44.861 --> 01:27:49.861
<v Speaker 1>It's assisted game of Kim and defer the game that preferred by James Bond Shemen</v>

3452
01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Shemen differ.</v>

3453
01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:53.351
<v Speaker 1>C,</v>

3454
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:53.801
<v Speaker 1>h e,</v>

3455
01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:54.041
<v Speaker 1>m,</v>

3456
01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:54.251
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3457
01:27:54.251 --> 01:27:54.641
<v Speaker 1>N,</v>

3458
01:27:54.641 --> 01:27:54.881
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

3459
01:27:54.881 --> 01:27:55.091
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

3460
01:27:55.091 --> 01:27:55.360
<v Speaker 1>f.</v>

3461
01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3462
01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:56.483
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3463
01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the high stakes game preferred by James Bond.</v>

3464
01:27:59.470 --> 01:28:00.670
<v Speaker 1>If he was real.</v>

3465
01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3466
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what the fuck's going to happen.</v>

3467
01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.270
<v Speaker 1>The they,</v>

3468
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.451
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3469
01:28:04.451 --> 01:28:04.601
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3470
01:28:04.601 --> 01:28:06.100
<v Speaker 1>this dude a shitload of money.</v>

3471
01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:08.410
<v Speaker 1>They owed him millions of dollars.</v>

3472
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be interesting to see if they can prove that he was doing that</v>

3473
01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.130
<v Speaker 1>or if he just got fucking lucky.</v>

3474
01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:15.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3475
01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:16.601
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to prove it now,</v>

3476
01:28:16.601 --> 01:28:17.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3477
01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:17.621
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno man.</v>

3478
01:28:17.621 --> 01:28:17.910
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3479
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:18.760
<v Speaker 1>they have the deck.</v>

3480
01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

3481
01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:22.300
<v Speaker 1>they're able to withhold the money,</v>

3482
01:28:22.450 --> 01:28:23.830
<v Speaker 1>which I think is hilarious.</v>

3483
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>

3484
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:26.530
<v Speaker 1>that in and of itself,</v>

3485
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that's like a violation of the contract that you made when you went in.</v>

3486
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:32.490
<v Speaker 1>If you can't prove that someone's cheating and they won,</v>

3487
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3488
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you to prove it before you withhold money.</v>

3489
01:28:36.821 --> 01:28:37.960
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say,</v>

3490
01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:39.650
<v Speaker 1>you think that he was doing this.</v>

3491
01:28:39.651 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 1>So you think that maybe the symmetrical cards or perhaps it's asymmetrical if</v>

3492
01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.940
<v Speaker 1>you coming up with a bunch of reasons why you think that this guy stole money</v>

3493
01:28:45.941 --> 01:28:46.750
<v Speaker 1>from you.</v>

3494
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:49.570
<v Speaker 1>But that's a weird thing to just allow this company because it has so much</v>

3495
01:28:49.571 --> 01:28:50.050
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

3496
01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It allow them to just steal money when they feel like they were fucked.</v>

3497
01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Whereas almost everybody goes in there,</v>

3498
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.940
<v Speaker 1>feels like they were fucked and no one cares.</v>

3499
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.601
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

3500
01:28:58.601 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>when ivy was down 770,000 what if he and said,</v>

3501
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3502
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.770
<v Speaker 6>I think this game is rigged and a,</v>

3503
01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:05.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm not paying you until I go to court.</v>

3504
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.650
<v Speaker 6>What if every time someone lost money,</v>

3505
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 6>it was that same arrangement.</v>

3506
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.170
<v Speaker 6>You would go bankrupt.</v>

3507
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:11.970
<v Speaker 6>They would go bankrupt because everybody would do it.</v>

3508
01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 6>Everybody would dispute it.</v>

3509
01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:13.350
<v Speaker 6>Because if you,</v>

3510
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:15.300
<v Speaker 6>if you win or they give up,</v>

3511
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.380
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to pay.</v>

3512
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.191
<v Speaker 6>But if you lose,</v>

3513
01:29:17.191 --> 01:29:17.791
<v Speaker 6>you have to pay.</v>

3514
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.990
<v Speaker 6>So everybody would try to dispute it in court if,</v>

3515
01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.450
<v Speaker 6>if everybody could do what they're doing,</v>

3516
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.700
<v Speaker 6>what they're doing is unbelievably douchey.</v>

3517
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 6>Casinos exist to lose money or to make money.</v>

3518
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:28.231
<v Speaker 6>They exist.</v>

3519
01:29:28.231 --> 01:29:29.430
<v Speaker 6>So other people lose money.</v>

3520
01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:31.230
<v Speaker 6>And if other people stop losing money,</v>

3521
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 6>they're fucked.</v>

3522
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 6>Their business models a mess.</v>

3523
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 6>So their business model is inequality,</v>

3524
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.860
<v Speaker 6>their business model ripping you off.</v>

3525
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:38.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

3526
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:40.110
<v Speaker 6>it's the most ridiculous shit ever.</v>

3527
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.790
<v Speaker 6>It's like the only way they can have these giant buildings is if you fucking</v>

3528
01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:45.510
<v Speaker 6>lose.</v>

3529
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:46.500
<v Speaker 6>And if you win,</v>

3530
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.490
<v Speaker 6>they can boot you out.</v>

3531
01:29:47.491 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a reason why the UFC doesn't go back to the palms cause cause Dana</v>

3532
01:29:51.571 --> 01:29:52.860
<v Speaker 6>white wiped him out.</v>

3533
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:57.480
<v Speaker 6>He plays high stakes blackjacks and he wiped them out and the next time he went</v>

3534
01:29:57.481 --> 01:29:59.760
<v Speaker 6>back they tried to give him half the,</v>

3535
01:29:59.761 --> 01:29:59.901
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3536
01:29:59.901 --> 01:30:03.450
<v Speaker 6>the credit limit because if he only has half the credit,</v>

3537
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:03.810
<v Speaker 6>can't,</v>

3538
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:04.920
<v Speaker 6>he can't come back.</v>

3539
01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:05.881
<v Speaker 6>Can't come back.</v>

3540
01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 6>Like the whole idea about blackjack and gambling is you gotta be ready to go</v>

3541
01:30:10.291 --> 01:30:13.530
<v Speaker 6>into a deep hole in order to win a lot of money.</v>

3542
01:30:13.531 --> 01:30:15.300
<v Speaker 6>You gotta be prepared to lose a lot of money.</v>

3543
01:30:15.450 --> 01:30:18.390
<v Speaker 6>And Dana's last as much as a million dollars in a night.</v>

3544
01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 6>I said he's one of those scary guys to them.</v>

3545
01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:22.023
<v Speaker 6>How's he goes in?</v>

3546
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:22.891
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3547
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:23.701
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand.</v>

3548
01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:24.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand.</v>

3549
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.240
<v Speaker 6>We had him in here and respectfully because I love him and he's my brother.</v>

3550
01:30:27.241 --> 01:30:28.460
<v Speaker 6>I tried to suggest that maybe yes,</v>

3551
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.353
<v Speaker 3>brain damage.</v>

3552
01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.573
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3553
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.091
<v Speaker 6>There's a connection.</v>

3554
01:30:33.091 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 6>I know that he's been at a lot of fights.</v>

3555
01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:34.801
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

3556
01:30:34.801 --> 01:30:35.161
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

3557
01:30:35.161 --> 01:30:36.240
<v Speaker 6>I grew up in Boston.</v>

3558
01:30:36.241 --> 01:30:37.590
<v Speaker 6>I know that he was a boxer.</v>

3559
01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:41.280
<v Speaker 6>I know that he hadn't been nears disease from a beating that he took one night</v>

3560
01:30:41.281 --> 01:30:42.090
<v Speaker 6>by a bunch of guys.</v>

3561
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:47.090
<v Speaker 6>So I know that he's been in a lot of fights and there's a direct correlation</v>

3562
01:30:48.061 --> 01:30:51.600
<v Speaker 6>that they've recently established between people that have a certain type of</v>

3563
01:30:51.601 --> 01:30:54.060
<v Speaker 6>brain damage and compulsive gambling.</v>

3564
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3565
01:30:54.531 --> 01:30:55.820
<v Speaker 3>let's be real candid though,</v>

3566
01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:56.840
<v Speaker 3>like Dana,</v>

3567
01:30:56.930 --> 01:31:01.930
<v Speaker 3>the kind of guy that is Dana white is also the kind of guy that is Charles</v>

3568
01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Barkley and Michael Jordan.</v>

3569
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:03.583
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jordan,</v>

3570
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:04.650
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>

3571
01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:06.710
<v Speaker 3>it's a guy that made magic happen,</v>

3572
01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:09.950
<v Speaker 3>made magic with his life happening on the paper.</v>

3573
01:31:09.951 --> 01:31:11.840
<v Speaker 3>He was not supposed to end up already is today.</v>

3574
01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3575
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.393
<v Speaker 3>But he did it.</v>

3576
01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:16.100
<v Speaker 3>So there's very different between him and those two guys because those two guys</v>

3577
01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:18.080
<v Speaker 3>were athletes and those two guys did it with,</v>

3578
01:31:18.081 --> 01:31:18.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3579
01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:20.510
<v Speaker 3>with natural athletic performances.</v>

3580
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.770
<v Speaker 3>When he did it with,</v>

3581
01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.820
<v Speaker 3>he was the perfect guy and the perfect time to run a business.</v>

3582
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:26.900
<v Speaker 3>That's that crazy.</v>

3583
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3584
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.741
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3585
01:31:27.741 --> 01:31:29.510
<v Speaker 3>to not try to water it down in any way,</v>

3586
01:31:29.511 --> 01:31:31.470
<v Speaker 3>shape or form to actually embrace the,</v>

3587
01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.790
<v Speaker 3>the aggressive aspects of it and exemplify them.</v>

3588
01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:35.181
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3589
01:31:35.181 --> 01:31:35.511
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

3590
01:31:35.511 --> 01:31:37.160
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird thing about who he is.</v>

3591
01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Cause like no CEOs,</v>

3592
01:31:38.931 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 3>whatever it behave like him,</v>

3593
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:41.111
<v Speaker 3>the way he behaves,</v>

3594
01:31:41.111 --> 01:31:44.150
<v Speaker 3>he's crazy as fights and people on Twitter go fuck your mother.</v>

3595
01:31:44.151 --> 01:31:46.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's a mad maybe the slim Jim I told,</v>

3596
01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I told the president travels handle she needed to slap slap chop guy.</v>

3597
01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:51.043
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you meant?</v>

3598
01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:53.710
<v Speaker 3>The snappiness Lindzen oh that's a rightie.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:31:55.071 --> 01:31:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's got a job though.</v>

3603
01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>See Dana bridges the gap between being a</v>

3604
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.810
<v Speaker 1>man's man and being a businessman.</v>

3605
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Like he knows how to do business as well,</v>

3606
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:05.050
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't give a fuck,</v>

3607
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:05.711
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3608
01:32:05.711 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And now that he's got a lot of money,</v>

3609
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 1>it gives even less of a fuck.</v>

3610
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 5>I told the president of travel channel at dinner that night that she needed to</v>

3611
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 5>run Twitter just like Dana White and be like,</v>

01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:06.210
<v Speaker 4>There was not one anywhere near there.</v>

3719
01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 4>Then I notice like the strip clubs,</v>

3720
01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:08.100
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3721
01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:10.950
<v Speaker 4>like they had really weird things going on with the strip clubs.</v>

3722
01:35:10.951 --> 01:35:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't touch the girls are</v>

3725
01:35:17.091 --> 01:35:18.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying and then I went to,</v>

3726
01:35:18.661 --> 01:35:18.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3727

<v Speaker 4>look for boner pills because I like to take it on stage.</v>

3728
01:35:21.771 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 4>When I had to do this bit about boner pills and like show people and stuff,</v>

3729
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:26.960
<v Speaker 4>I went to maybe five,</v>

3730
01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:27.291
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

3732
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Finally I just went to the guy,</v>

3733
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:30.771
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3734
01:35:30.771 --> 01:35:30.981
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:32.200
<v Speaker 4>They have these things.</v>

3737
01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.270

3738
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.820

3741
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.141
<v Speaker 4>no way,</v>

3742
01:35:36.141 --> 01:35:36.381
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3743
01:35:36.381 --> 01:35:38.390
<v Speaker 4>They don't sell that shit here in Canada.</v>

3744
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:42.620
<v Speaker 4>And I would just seem like Canada's seemed really a censored in some ways.</v>

3745
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.633
<v Speaker 4>And then that's fine.</v>

3746
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.533
<v Speaker 3>Boner pills,</v>

3750
01:35:48.271 --> 01:35:49.200
<v Speaker 3>there was no boner pills.</v>

3751
01:35:49.201 --> 01:35:50.190
<v Speaker 3>What a bullshit country.</v>

3752
01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.260
<v Speaker 3>The whole country basically is bullshit.</v>

3753
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:53.143
<v Speaker 3>The city,</v>

3754

3879
01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:05.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3880
01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's scary shit.</v>

3881
01:39:06.610 --> 01:39:08.240
<v Speaker 2>He's gangster cause you just find it.</v>

3882
01:39:08.241 --> 01:39:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Well that you don't know what that does to the fucking pressure system.</v>

3883
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.110
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] be so weird.</v>

3884
01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:12.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3885
01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:12.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3886
01:39:12.931 --> 01:39:15.390
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the theories about the Bermuda triangle.</v>

3887
01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:17.790
<v Speaker 1>The Bermuda triangle is like a legit mystery.</v>

3888
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And one of the,</v>

3889
01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:23.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the theories about the Bermuda triangle is a certain amount of</v>

3890
01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:26.370
<v Speaker 1>underground gas getting released.</v>

3891
01:39:26.371 --> 01:39:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's nitrogen.</v>

3892
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:28.783
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

3893
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the gas it is.</v>

3894
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say whatever the gas is not as would makes sense.</v>

3895
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause then that would cut engines.</v>

3896
01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>

3897
01:39:36.901 --> 01:39:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's under the underground in massive pockets of like decaying seaweed and</v>

3898
01:39:41.671 --> 01:39:42.504
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3899
01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And apparently when it bursts,</v>

3900
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it goes through the water,</v>

3901
01:39:46.141 --> 01:39:51.141
<v Speaker 1>rises up into the atmosphere and it kills a plane's ability to fly because it's,</v>

3902
01:39:51.681 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like a big giant cloud.</v>

3903
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So these planes nose dive and then when it hits boats,</v>

3904
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:59.850
<v Speaker 1>like the nitrogen rich water,</v>

3905
01:39:59.851 --> 01:40:00.220
<v Speaker 1>when it hits</v>

3906
01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:00.461
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>

3907
01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:01.220
<v Speaker 2>they just sink.</v>

3908
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I see someone who's obsessed with the Bermuda triangle when I was a kid,</v>

3909
01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:06.820
<v Speaker 2>big foot Bermuda triangle,</v>

3910
01:40:06.970 --> 01:40:08.770
<v Speaker 2>fucking horses.</v>

3911
01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Lat doesn't have anything to do with each other and precious gems.</v>

3912
01:40:12.161 --> 01:40:14.020
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck those or do you remember the show?</v>

3913
01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the big flood angel?</v>

3914
01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3915
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.510
<v Speaker 2>anything that had like some like through the member that's figuring and horses</v>

3916
01:40:19.511 --> 01:40:20.020
<v Speaker 2>where they'd be.</v>

3917
01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:20.711
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about this,</v>

3918
01:40:20.711 --> 01:40:23.080
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm going looking for bigfoot with Dunkin this week.</v>

3919
01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Are you fucking serious?</v>

3920
01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.300
<v Speaker 2>We're gone from my new shot.</v>

3921
01:40:25.301 --> 01:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>We're going looking for bigfoot.</v>

3922
01:40:26.410 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3923
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:31.220
<v Speaker 2>we're going into like known habitat's going happy.</v>

3924
01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

3925
01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you find them and then it's like all these years you just needed to go out</v>

3926
01:40:34.511 --> 01:40:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and take three day vacation and find them.</v>

3927
01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:38.140
<v Speaker 2>There's something going on,</v>

3928
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:39.290
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on.</v>

3929
01:40:39.291 --> 01:40:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how many pissed off bigfoot hundreds.</v>

3930
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:42.131
<v Speaker 2>Well this is,</v>

3931
01:40:42.131 --> 01:40:43.210
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going on</v>

3932
01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.500
<v Speaker 1>with the whole big foot thing.</v>

3933
01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:45.191
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

3934
01:40:45.191 --> 01:40:46.390
<v Speaker 1>someone has to decide.</v>

3935
01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to investigate what's going on cause it's even there's this</v>

3936
01:40:50.681 --> 01:40:52.360
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that it's real,</v>

3937
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:54.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's is that everyone is losing their mind,</v>

3938
01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 1>including me for going and looking for this fucking thing.</v>

3939
01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:57.371
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3940
01:40:57.371 --> 01:40:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is,</v>

3941
01:40:58.420 --> 01:40:59.020
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3942
01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>this is what fucking need to do with their lives.</v>

3943
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:02.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3944
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 1>It could be some sort of a mass hysteria type thing.</v>

3945
01:41:05.561 --> 01:41:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is.</v>

3946
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.570
<v Speaker 1>But I think to approach any unusual suspect,</v>

3947
01:41:10.571 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you would like it to be.</v>

3948
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Of course I would like to go there and see big foot.</v>

3949
01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.031
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3950
01:41:16.031 --> 01:41:16.511
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3951
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I would like to go there and get convincing video and photographs and,</v>

3952
01:41:21.421 --> 01:41:23.470
<v Speaker 1>and sounds of bigfoot of course.</v>

3953
01:41:23.890 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 1>But I've got to really be honest.</v>

3954
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 1>There is a possibility it doesn't exist.</v>

3955
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And all these people that have told me it exists,</v>

3956
01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to disbelieve them.</v>

3957
01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.160
<v Speaker 1>The people that have told me they've had experiences,</v>

3958
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to disbelieve them.</v>

3959
01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:40.630
<v Speaker 1>But I have not had those experiences myself.</v>

3960
01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:45.930
<v Speaker 1>So even if I do believe them and trust them 100% I still don't 100% know that</v>

3961
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.060
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

3962
01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Are you bringing any technology with you?</v>

3963
01:41:48.521 --> 01:41:48.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

3964
01:41:48.941 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So you believe in the culinary man.</v>

3965
01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.040
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look at it from overhead with a blimp.</v>

3966
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Infrared and now we're gonna.</v>

3967
01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.120
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna figure out a bunch of different ways when we might go twice.</v>

3968
01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:01.630
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go this time and then I'm going to try to go in July with Les</v>

3969
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Stroud.</v>

3970
01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back with survivor.</v>

3971
01:42:03.131 --> 01:42:03.401
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3972
01:42:03.401 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go one and we're gonna Talk Shit on bear.</v>

3973
01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Bear Grylls the whole time we're there.</v>

3974
01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hotel stamp bitch when we're out there roughing it with it.</v>

3975
01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Sticks up our ass sleeping in tents,</v>

3976
01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.910
<v Speaker 1>bear Grylls and lounge at the four seasons slippers on.</v>

3977
01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Watching pay per view that fuck.</v>

3978
01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:18.971
<v Speaker 1>When you were a kid,</v>

3979
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:19.804
<v Speaker 1>did you watch,</v>

3980
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:20.651
<v Speaker 1>did you watch the show?</v>

3981
01:42:20.651 --> 01:42:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot in search of with Leonard Nimoy?</v>

3982
01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:23.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3983
01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot and wild boy I to,</v>

3984
01:42:25.110 --> 01:42:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed with that show.</v>

3985
01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.190
<v Speaker 1>You probably got dropped in your head or something?</v>

3986
01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I probably do cloth until I was in a fucking second grade.</v>

3987
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Every single day when I got to play loincloth and moccasins,</v>

3988
01:42:35.410 --> 01:42:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I went camping with my family when I was probably like</v>

3989
01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:42.490
<v Speaker 1>probably 10 ish somewhere around then.</v>

3990
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:43.750
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3991
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:48.750
<v Speaker 1>we were up in the northern California area and I ran into a trapper and a guy</v>

3992
01:42:49.331 --> 01:42:50.164
<v Speaker 1>like gave me like,</v>

3993
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty gross and all that,</v>

3994
01:42:51.321 --> 01:42:51.781
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>

3995
01:42:51.781 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>it gave me like a real rabbit's foot.</v>

3996
01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:54.850
<v Speaker 1>It was like a fucking rabbit.</v>

3997
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.181
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3998
01:42:55.181 --> 01:42:56.170
<v Speaker 1>it started rotting,</v>

3999
01:42:56.171 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 1>it stunk.</v>

4000
01:42:56.890 --> 01:42:57.723
<v Speaker 1>It was nasty.</v>

4001
01:42:57.970 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Kept in a paper bag and I opened the bag and I'm like,</v>

4002
01:43:00.221 --> 01:43:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

4003
01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Bob gimme a bobcat foot.</v>

4004
01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fucked up when I think about it because,</v>

4005
01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:05.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4006
01:43:05.621 --> 01:43:06.311
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like,</v>

4007
01:43:06.311 --> 01:43:10.030
<v Speaker 1>essentially it was killing these animals and cutting of skin off.</v>

4008
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he made a living.</v>

4009
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:12.333
<v Speaker 1>And it was really,</v>

4010
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.560
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird if you stop,</v>

4011
01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking drivers are creepy.</v>

4012
01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way to make a living man.</v>

4013
01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4014
01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:18.181
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4015
01:43:18.181 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

4016
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not for it,</v>

4017
01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but here's the,</v>

4018
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:23.254
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

4019
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.270
<v Speaker 1>When you look at like someone who kills Minx,</v>

4020
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:26.051
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

4021
01:43:26.051 --> 01:43:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you're killing an animal only for its skin.</v>

4022
01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not really going to eat it.</v>

4023
01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's a buffalo and you're going to get both out of it.</v>

4024
01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You're only actively going after this animal for its skin.</v>

4025
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a fucked up thing.</v>

4026
01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:39.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a serial killers do that with humans.</v>

4027
01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a fucked up thing.</v>

4028
01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 1>But what's the thing,</v>

4029
01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.080
<v Speaker 1>the other thing to consider is,</v>

4030
01:43:44.081 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4031
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:45.220
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

4032
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:45.650
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>

4033
01:43:45.650 --> 01:43:47.650
<v Speaker 1>what's the life expectancy of these animals?</v>

4034
01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very small.</v>

4035
01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:49.803
<v Speaker 1>It's very short.</v>

4036
01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't kill them,</v>

4037
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.820
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that some wolf is going to come along and kill them or some</v>

4038
01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:56.840
<v Speaker 1>coyote or whatever.</v>

4039
01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So the real question becomes,</v>

4040
01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 1>do you deserve to be the person,</v>

4041
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:02.300
<v Speaker 1>be the,</v>

4042
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.661
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4043
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:05.600
<v Speaker 1>the being that kills this for a different desire.</v>

4044
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Your desire is to have it enhance your artificially created culture,</v>

4045
01:44:10.011 --> 01:44:15.011
<v Speaker 1>life you to take the skin from this animal and turn it into currency and in</v>

4046
01:44:15.931 --> 01:44:16.290
<v Speaker 1>order to,</v>

4047
01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:16.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4048
01:44:16.551 --> 01:44:17.750
<v Speaker 1>it's again to help you,</v>

4049
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:19.820
<v Speaker 1>enable you to live like a better life.</v>

4050
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Or is it only reserved for wolves?</v>

4051
01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.713
<v Speaker 1>Deet?</v>

4052
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird little situation because no,</v>

4053
01:44:27.431 --> 01:44:29.840
<v Speaker 1>no fucking minks die of old age,</v>

4054
01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:30.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4055
01:44:30.491 --> 01:44:31.790
<v Speaker 1>and make it to old age man.</v>

4056
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody makes it to old age.</v>

4057
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:34.480
<v Speaker 1>He fuck as much as you can.</v>

4058
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You make as many babies as you can and you gotta be confident in the fact that</v>

4059
01:44:37.761 --> 01:44:42.350
<v Speaker 1>most likely a lot of people you know are going to get eaten by wolves for your</v>

4060
01:44:42.351 --> 01:44:42.640
<v Speaker 1>mink.</v>

4061
01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Fear for years is how long it makes Lyft.</v>

4062
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4063
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:50.110
<v Speaker 1>and they make it an either you're not making it to four and I don't want to be</v>

4064
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the one who kills a mink for it's for.</v>

4065
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:55.610
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the real situation,</v>

4066
01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite as simple as a person shouldn't be able to do that because</v>

4067
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.560
<v Speaker 1>there's people that live in like say let's go talk about like the people that</v>

4068
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:04.430
<v Speaker 1>live in the taiga,</v>

4069
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:08.960
<v Speaker 1>they live in Siberia and that's how their family has been making a living for</v>

4070
01:45:08.961 --> 01:45:12.080
<v Speaker 1>generation after generation because it makes you uncomfortable.</v>

4071
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:12.381
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>

4072
01:45:12.381 --> 01:45:16.910
<v Speaker 1>They be forced to stop doing that because that's like a giant percentage of</v>

4073
01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:17.541
<v Speaker 1>their income.</v>

4074
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what they use to buy snowmobiles and what they used to buy tools.</v>

4075
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:26.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like this weird hunting and gathering culture that lives in Siberia and the</v>

4076
01:45:26.841 --> 01:45:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Taiga forest and these people,</v>

4077
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:30.680
<v Speaker 1>they need those minx.</v>

4078
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.810
<v Speaker 1>They need those whatever the animals that are trapping,</v>

4079
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:34.820
<v Speaker 1>they need those furs and they,</v>

4080
01:45:34.821 --> 01:45:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not just their family,</v>

4081
01:45:36.111 --> 01:45:39.050
<v Speaker 1>their generation after generation has been trapping and hunting.</v>

4082
01:45:39.051 --> 01:45:39.290
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4083
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:40.310
<v Speaker 1>that's how they live up there.</v>

4084
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:42.440
<v Speaker 1>So who's to say that they can't do it?</v>

4085
01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:43.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4086
01:45:43.071 --> 01:45:44.030
<v Speaker 1>if they can do it,</v>

4087
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:45.560
<v Speaker 1>who's buying their first?</v>

4088
01:45:45.561 --> 01:45:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Well people down here behind the people in Beverly Hills or buying some furs</v>

4089
01:45:48.441 --> 01:45:49.460
<v Speaker 1>that came right out of stripe.</v>

4090
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:50.313
<v Speaker 1>Siberia.</v>

4091
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 1>And that is how those people are,</v>

4092
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:54.350
<v Speaker 1>are able to survive.</v>

4093
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:55.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's a tricky situation.</v>

4094
01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite as simple to me as a cut and black,</v>

4095
01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:01.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4096
01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:02.001
<v Speaker 1>black and white.</v>

4097
01:46:02.001 --> 01:46:03.650
<v Speaker 1>You should not be able to do that.</v>

4098
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:08.770
<v Speaker 1>We as a society should stop that because it's evil and the stealing of fur and</v>

4099
01:46:09.561 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>skin from an animal and killing it because of that.</v>

4100
01:46:11.481 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really gross and vile.</v>

4101
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.360
<v Speaker 1>And I agree with that.</v>

4102
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree with that.</v>

4103
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:20.600
<v Speaker 1>But I also realistically look at the situation and go,</v>

4104
01:46:20.601 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 1>well these are,</v>

4105
01:46:21.110 --> 01:46:21.591
<v Speaker 1>these are not,</v>

4106
01:46:21.591 --> 01:46:22.670
<v Speaker 1>animals are gonna live forever.</v>

4107
01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4108
01:46:23.091 --> 01:46:23.510
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

4109
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:25.010
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird existence.</v>

4110
01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 1>This thing has its living in this frozen Tundra and everywhere it goes,</v>

4111
01:46:29.271 --> 01:46:30.350
<v Speaker 1>something's looking to eat it.</v>

4112
01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:31.081
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4113
01:46:31.081 --> 01:46:33.430
<v Speaker 1>oh listen to you going to want to fox to eat it or a wolf,</v>

4114
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>eat it in two weeks and then we don't get suffer.</v>

4115
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I watched one of them was,</v>

4116
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:37.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4117
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:38.803
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

4118
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

4119
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Alaska shows and uh,</v>

4120
01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:42.650

4121
01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a link.</v>

4122
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4123
01:46:43.851 --> 01:46:47.810
<v Speaker 1>is that like a black cat to fucking cat that lives in Alaska?</v>

4124
01:46:48.170 --> 01:46:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like this crazy looking giant house cat looking thing with these wild ears.</v>

4125
01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:55.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a nasty animal,</v>

4126
01:46:55.291 --> 01:46:55.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4127
01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking domesticate one of those.</v>

4128
01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:58.201

4133
01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't domesticate wild animals.</v>

4134
01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:07.890

<v Speaker 1>Savannah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>third grader.</v>

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I would not let that thing hang with my kids.</v>

<v Speaker 1>10 of them in my backyard.</v>

4159
01:47:44.851 --> 01:47:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I live on top of a mountain in Ohio's fucking cow and they fucking roam outdoors</v>

4160
01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and rattlesnakes and shit.</v>

4161
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4162
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:51.871
<v Speaker 1>I have chickens,</v>

4163
01:47:51.871 --> 01:47:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean event chickens for the last few months.</v>

4164
01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4165
01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I can let my dogs around the chickens but I can't let my cat get out.</v>

4166
01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And my cat,</v>

4167
01:47:58.690 --> 01:48:01.530
<v Speaker 1>he stands outside the window and sees the chickens and goes like,</v>

4168
01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:02.373
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

4169
01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.810
<v Speaker 1>really is a mouse start shaking cause he's like,</v>

4170
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:11.460
<v Speaker 1>cause his jaw is quivering because all he's thinking about doing is taking life.</v>

4171
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.920
<v Speaker 1>That's all I can think about is watch these little chicks tweet,</v>

4172
01:48:13.921 --> 01:48:14.131
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

4173
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:14.371
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

4174
01:48:14.371 --> 01:48:14.611
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

4175
01:48:14.611 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 1>tweet walking around and he just wants to bum rush them and just steal on him</v>

4176
01:48:18.721 --> 01:48:19.800
<v Speaker 1>and just rip them apart.</v>

4177
01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:22.050
<v Speaker 1>And all of his instincts are just fighting it off.</v>

4178
01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:23.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop that.</v>

4179
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't prevent a cat from doing that.</v>

4180
01:48:26.131 --> 01:48:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't train it out of them,</v>

4181
01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:28.441
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

4182
01:48:28.441 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 1>A dog like my massive,</v>

4183
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he would want to kill those things,</v>

4184
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but I show him,</v>

4185
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4186
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4187
01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:35.310
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

4188
01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 1>easy buddy and his tails wag.</v>

4189
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:38.011
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

4190
01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 1>okay so don't kill him.</v>

4191
01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:39.401
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

4192
01:48:39.401 --> 01:48:40.234
<v Speaker 1>go kill him.</v>

4193
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And I totally trust him.</v>

4194
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust my cat or cats at that cow with Venetia and that fucking bad ass.</v>

4195
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:48.840
<v Speaker 1>You know those things are unpredictable,</v>

4196
01:48:48.841 --> 01:48:49.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4197
01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4198
01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the behavior patterns of those things are,</v>

4199
01:48:52.561 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to think that it's a bad idea to bring in a half a wild anything.</v>

4200
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend of mine's huskies.</v>

4201
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend.</v>

4202
01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.121
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4203
01:48:59.121 --> 01:48:59.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4204
01:48:59.191 --> 01:48:59.311
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4205
01:48:59.311 --> 01:49:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Husky is a breed.</v>

4206
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.540
<v Speaker 1>The big difference between a Husky looks like a wolf.</v>

4207
01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:04.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a breed.</v>

4208
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:08.490
<v Speaker 1>But I have a friend that has three seven eighth Timberwolves.</v>

4209
01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Seven eighth.</v>

4210
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:10.261
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4211
01:49:10.261 --> 01:49:13.230
<v Speaker 1>there's seven ace Timberwolf and one [inaudible].</v>

4212
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:14.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4213
01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.660
<v Speaker 1>he does not have kids but he's got a weird situation,</v>

4214
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.171
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4215
01:49:19.171 --> 01:49:19.771
<v Speaker 1>And I told them,</v>

4216
01:49:19.771 --> 01:49:20.131
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4217
01:49:20.131 --> 01:49:20.311
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4218
01:49:20.311 --> 01:49:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you're barely in control of this household.</v>

4219
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got a big male and the big male is totally dominant.</v>

4220
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:27.571
<v Speaker 1>The big male.</v>

4221
01:49:27.571 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 1>In fact God out once it killed his neighbor sheep like you had like a,</v>

4222
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:33.480
<v Speaker 1>it's got a wolf.</v>

4223
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:34.500
<v Speaker 1>He lives with a wolf.</v>

4224
01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:37.140
<v Speaker 1>He's one thunder storm away from a fucking coup d'etat.</v>

4225
01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:38.243
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4226
01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not cool with one Zombie apocalypse.</v>

4227
01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Zombies will never get to him.</v>

4228
01:49:44.761 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause the wolves will eat him as soon as they go hungry.</v>

4229
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:48.170
<v Speaker 1>As long as they run out of canned</v>

4230
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.470
<v Speaker 3>dog food and dry food and you can't go outside,</v>

4231
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:51.790
<v Speaker 3>the wolves are going to look at them and go,</v>

4232
01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:52.091
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4233
01:49:52.091 --> 01:49:52.271
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4234
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:53.350
<v Speaker 3>you can't take care of us anymore,</v>

4235
01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:53.890
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

4236
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:55.000
<v Speaker 3>This agreement that we have,</v>

4237
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:55.301
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4238
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:56.320
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to let that go.</v>

4239
01:49:56.650 --> 01:49:58.270
<v Speaker 3>He's got a 200 pound both in his house.</v>

4240
01:49:59.050 --> 01:50:00.940
<v Speaker 3>200 pounds is a big fucking animal.</v>

4241
01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:01.803
<v Speaker 3>It's enormous.</v>

4242
01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Do Art.</v>

4243
01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Priscilla's 130 pounds and I imagine it might not be 200 pounds.</v>

4244
01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:08.280
<v Speaker 3>It's at least one 50 it.</v>

4245
01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant monster.</v>

4246
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:13.740
<v Speaker 3>My my massive is one 40 and it was way bigger than my mastiff is way bigger,</v>

4247
01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 3>way taller.</v>

4248
01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:15.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a big animal.</v>

4249
01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember coming over his house and was like,</v>

4250
01:50:17.231 --> 01:50:17.411
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4251
01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>

4252
01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Like you got a weird situation here and like when you make this noise,</v>

4253
01:50:21.761 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 3>you go like this.</v>

4254
01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Whew.</v>

4255
01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:24.453
<v Speaker 3>The dogs would go,</v>

4256
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.380
<v Speaker 3>they would start howling and you realize right away,</v>

4257
01:50:29.381 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 3>these are not dogs,</v>

4258
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:31.030
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4259
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:32.480
<v Speaker 3>They look a little like dog.</v>

4260
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't have dogs.</v>

4261
01:50:33.951 --> 01:50:35.980
<v Speaker 3>You got fucking wild animals in your house.</v>

4262
01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing that we have domain over them.</v>

4263
01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 3>He barely had domain.</v>

4264
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:40.391
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>

4265
01:50:40.391 --> 01:50:43.270
<v Speaker 3>This dude is barely keeping it together and he would like I said,</v>

4268
01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 3>It was yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like he killed one cheap and was satisfied and it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4275
01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.970
<v Speaker 3>That was a reality show.</v>

4276
01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.610
<v Speaker 3>It was a neighbor's ranch and the neighbor,</v>

4277
01:51:00.611 --> 01:51:00.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4281
01:51:05.821 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Neighbor came over to the shore fucking shotgun and he's kind of a con for not</v>

4282
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth.</v>

4283
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:11.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4284
01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:12.010
<v Speaker 3>you got to man up.</v>

4285
01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.590
<v Speaker 3>You want to be a bad ass and have a fucking pet wolf.</v>

4286
01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:14.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4287
01:51:14.891 --> 01:51:16.640
<v Speaker 3>when the wolf kills 18 sheep,</v>

4288
01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:17.620
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell it did,</v>

4289
01:51:17.650 --> 01:51:20.110
<v Speaker 3>can he just go with it was eight or 18 one of those.</v>

4290
01:51:20.111 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Either one is equally impressive.</v>

4291
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Let's take it once you've killed eight.</v>

4292
01:51:22.631 --> 01:51:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Let's go with eight.</v>

4293
01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Eight to fucking think about how much time it takes to kill eight things with</v>

4294
01:51:26.581 --> 01:51:27.414
<v Speaker 3>your face.</v>

4295
01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Just run around jacket eight sheet.</v>

4296
01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.170
<v Speaker 3>It's ripping throat.</v>

4297
01:51:33.171 --> 01:51:34.004
<v Speaker 3>That will</v>

4298
01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:37.330
<v Speaker 3>kill one cheap with your face.</v>

4299
01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4300
01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.033
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4301
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:39.730
<v Speaker 3>A lot of work.</v>

4302
01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I could pretend to kill it.</v>

4303
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:41.584
<v Speaker 3>My face.</v>

4304
01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I'd have it in a rear naked and then I would like go sideways and pretend to be</v>

4305
01:51:45.431 --> 01:51:46.211
<v Speaker 3>biting the juggler,</v>

4306
01:51:46.211 --> 01:51:46.571
<v Speaker 3>but real,</v>

4307
01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I'd kill it with a rear naked start.</v>

4308
01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.950
<v Speaker 3>The time he could get around it.</v>

4309
01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:53.350
<v Speaker 3>You could get around a sheep's neck and put it out.</v>

4310
01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

4311
01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is not going to struggle.</v>

4312
01:51:54.821 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't until it starts.</v>

4313
01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Once you have your hooks in,</v>

4314
01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:57.941
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

4315
01:51:57.941 --> 01:51:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Our struggle all day.</v>

4316
01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Do you have your hooks in?</v>

4317
01:52:00.370 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not going anywhere.</v>

4318
01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Fucking sheep doesn't know.</v>

4319
01:52:02.531 --> 01:52:03.364
<v Speaker 3>No defense.</v>

4320
01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Sheep doesn't even have any hands.</v>

4321
01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.240
<v Speaker 3>She'd can't go two on one.</v>

4322
01:52:07.241 --> 01:52:09.310
<v Speaker 3>She can't get us an arm bar.</v>

4323
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:11.583
<v Speaker 3>It's going out.</v>

4324
01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:12.603
<v Speaker 3>It's going out.</v>

4325
01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Fucking sheep's going out.</v>

4326
01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:16.380
<v Speaker 3>They were talking,</v>

4327
01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:16.931
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about,</v>

4328
01:52:16.931 --> 01:52:21.931
<v Speaker 3>I was watching something where someone got caught in an exotic pet fighting</v>

4329
01:52:22.271 --> 01:52:22.481
<v Speaker 3>ring.</v>

4330
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:24.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a new show on to new shows on TV.</v>

4331
01:52:24.881 --> 01:52:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I just saw the promo for it,</v>

4332
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Exxon.</v>

4333
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:28.610
<v Speaker 3>It's called Tarzan.</v>

4334
01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:29.573
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4335
01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 3>fucking stupid name.</v>

4336
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Tarzan.</v>

4337
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Don't they know there's a whole book and movie series with that same name?</v>

4338
01:52:34.751 --> 01:52:35.920
<v Speaker 3>You confuse the shit out of people,</v>

4339
01:52:35.921 --> 01:52:36.970
<v Speaker 3>but can you see if you can find that?</v>

4340
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not like our tone and the talk show host goes in.</v>

4341
01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was his fucking name.</v>

4342
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.801
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4343
01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 3>The guy's name is Tarzan.</v>

4344
01:52:45.951 --> 01:52:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that guy.</v>

4345
01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:47.121
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

4346
01:52:47.121 --> 01:52:50.600
<v Speaker 3>he goes in and he finds an exotic pet fighting ring and I'm like,</v>

4347
01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:51.291
<v Speaker 3>if he found that,</v>

4348
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:51.931
<v Speaker 3>we would have heard about,</v>

4349
01:52:51.931 --> 01:52:52.510
<v Speaker 3>but that by now,</v>

4350
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:53.600
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily.</v>

4351
01:52:53.601 --> 01:52:55.160
<v Speaker 3>It could have been a [inaudible] ring.</v>

4352
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4353
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:57.531
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

4354
01:52:57.531 --> 01:52:58.364
<v Speaker 3>That's a city.</v>

4355
01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an also the problem is that like they could have created that</v>

4356
01:53:01.371 --> 01:53:03.770
<v Speaker 3>themselves just to make a TV show about it.</v>

4357
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:05.330
<v Speaker 3>That's super possible.</v>

4358
01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Some of those shows I'm like,</v>

4367
01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:16.820

<v Speaker 3>Where's the mic thrown on the table?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it as a lot of that.</v>

01:54:57.021 --> 01:54:57.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4424
01:54:57.231 --> 01:54:57.711
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

4425
01:54:57.711 --> 01:54:58.970
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to make a sitcom,</v>

4426
01:54:59.150 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's not okay to take a bunch of people that actually do work in an auto</v>

4427
01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:05.950
<v Speaker 3>garage and make a bunch of fake scenarios and they actually tried half and a</v>

4428
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:06.783
<v Speaker 3>half unique person.</v>

4429
01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 3>But why does it drive you nuts?</v>

4430
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:08.631
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4431
01:55:08.631 --> 01:55:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not mean if once you establish what it is,</v>

4432
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:13.550
<v Speaker 3>it's just a show.</v>

4433
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:14.623
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

4434
01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:15.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4435
01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.440
<v Speaker 3>well I'll say this from my perspective.</v>

4436
01:55:18.441 --> 01:55:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I watched duck dynasty,</v>

4437
01:55:19.521 --> 01:55:20.354
<v Speaker 3>the people that,</v>

4438
01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:21.673
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

4439
01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.300
<v Speaker 3>how fucking dare you,</v>

4440
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.861
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

4441
01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:26.310
<v Speaker 3>You're a standup comedian.</v>

4442
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a wife,</v>

4443
01:55:27.351 --> 01:55:28.400
<v Speaker 3>you have children,</v>

4444
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:31.670
<v Speaker 3>you have things to do and you're watching duck dynasty.</v>

4445
01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I got 40 minutes of my life digit shit away.</v>

4446
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I was on the road,</v>

4447
01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I was on the road,</v>

4448
01:55:40.491 --> 01:55:40.881
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

4449
01:55:40.881 --> 01:55:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Write a joke bitch.</v>

4450
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:44.680
<v Speaker 3>And I'm watching it by weight.</v>

4451
01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Completely hypocritical and guilty as charged and watch duck dynasty all the</v>

4452
01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:49.210
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

4453
01:55:49.210 --> 01:55:49.751
<v Speaker 5>Someone told me,</v>

4454
01:55:49.751 --> 01:55:49.961
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

4455
01:55:49.961 --> 01:55:50.621
<v Speaker 5>you gotta watch it.</v>

4456
01:55:50.621 --> 01:55:50.890
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4457
01:55:50.890 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 5>it gets me like network numbers.</v>

4458
01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.020
<v Speaker 5>It's not good.</v>

4459
01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:57.130
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4460
01:55:57.130 --> 01:55:57.963
<v Speaker 5>here's my thing.</v>

4461
01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:02.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind a fake reality show if it's a nod to a fake reality show,</v>

4462
01:56:03.130 --> 01:56:05.080
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that you're trying to fool me,</v>

4463
01:56:05.170 --> 01:56:06.070
<v Speaker 5>pisses me off.</v>

4464
01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.890
<v Speaker 5>And what sucks is distinctly on trip flip.</v>

4465
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:13.570
<v Speaker 5>I have fought like tooth and nail to make sure that all our crashes are real,</v>

4466
01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.070
<v Speaker 5>but they look fake as fuck.</v>

4467
01:56:15.071 --> 01:56:15.904
<v Speaker 5>When I watched them,</v>

4468
01:56:16.210 --> 01:56:16.481
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

4469
01:56:16.481 --> 01:56:18.070
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't look like we really crashed it,</v>

4470
01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:18.551
<v Speaker 5>but we really,</v>

4471
01:56:18.551 --> 01:56:20.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm standing on the street corner just like a real person.</v>

4472
01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:22.270
<v Speaker 5>But then you want to duck dynasty and people are willing to go,</v>

4473
01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.100
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

4474
01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:25.570
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking we'd all go to Hawaii.</v>

4475
01:56:25.571 --> 01:56:25.751
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4476
01:56:25.751 --> 01:56:26.021
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4477
01:56:26.021 --> 01:56:27.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to go to Hawaii.</v>

4478
01:56:27.821 --> 01:56:27.971
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4479
01:56:27.971 --> 01:56:28.810
<v Speaker 5>what are we going to do?</v>

4480
01:56:28.811 --> 01:56:29.411
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry.</v>

4481
01:56:29.411 --> 01:56:30.520
<v Speaker 5>I'll plan it all.</v>

4482
01:56:30.521 --> 01:56:31.840
<v Speaker 5>And then he watches it blowing in your face.</v>

4483
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.960
<v Speaker 5>It's Sitcom writing.</v>

4484
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:35.980
<v Speaker 3>That's why Dunkin refuse to go on.</v>

4485
01:56:35.981 --> 01:56:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4487
01:56:38.261 --> 01:56:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Like he knew they were going to make him do something along those lines.</v>

4488
01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4489
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:43.631
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

4490
01:56:43.631 --> 01:56:43.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4491

<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

4492
01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I would rather not be on TV.</v>

4493
01:56:46.630 --> 01:56:46.931
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

4494

4498
01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:52.561

4507
01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.590
<v Speaker 3>bigfoot needed with someone like me to come along.</v>

4508
01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe bigfoot is tired of these fucking dorks out there.</v>

4509
01:57:12.071 --> 01:57:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Wander around these unfuckable dorks baby.</v>

4510
01:57:15.890 --> 01:57:17.650
<v Speaker 3>The big foot needs someone to talk to.</v>

4511
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe bigfoot was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>t takes Tom's girl to go hunt for loch ness monster and scuba gear and he's got</v>

4526
01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:49.220
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be fucking awesome.</v>

4527
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:49.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4528
01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:50.890
<v Speaker 3>but what's not going to be awesome?</v>

4529
01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:52.230
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to find the fucking lock.</v>

4530
01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Does it matter?</v>

4531
01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:55.710
<v Speaker 3>What would you like to go on?</v>

4532
01:57:55.711 --> 01:57:58.380
<v Speaker 3>If you could pack one thing I actually like,</v>

4533
01:57:58.381 --> 01:58:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone really believes that there is a big scraped.</v>

4534
01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4535
01:58:01.450 --> 01:58:04.950
<v Speaker 3>But what do you think is most likely if I gave you a couple scenarios?</v>

4536
01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Big Squirting.</v>

4537
01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:06.633
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4538
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:08.670
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good one.</v>

4539
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4540
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Not even remotely feel much macabre.</v>

4541
01:58:11.410 --> 01:58:12.630
<v Speaker 3>You if you had to choose,</v>

4542
01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:14.010
<v Speaker 3>if you had a possibility,</v>

4543
01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:15.130
<v Speaker 3>would it be sick,</v>

4544
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.080
<v Speaker 3>toxic,</v>

4545
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4546
01:58:16.230 --> 01:58:17.063
<v Speaker 3>in Japan.</v>

4547
01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4548
01:58:17.530 --> 01:58:17.881
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4549
01:58:17.881 --> 01:58:18.541
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear waste.</v>

4550
01:58:18.541 --> 01:58:19.291
<v Speaker 3>But that's another way.</v>

4551
01:58:19.291 --> 01:58:20.340
<v Speaker 3>That's not a question.</v>

4552
01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4553
01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:21.750
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

4554
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:22.291
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4555
01:58:22.291 --> 01:58:23.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue.</v>

4556
01:58:23.490 --> 01:58:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4557
01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:24.810
<v Speaker 3>People that have,</v>

4558
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:25.710
<v Speaker 3>they're in Japan.</v>

4559
01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:26.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

4560
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.140
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever seen those Geiger counter videos.</v>

4561
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4562
01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Really fascinating stuff because there's a completely different rating reading</v>

4563
01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:36.030
<v Speaker 3>when you have it and you're holding it up in the air as opposed to when you put</v>

4564
01:58:36.031 --> 01:58:36.721
<v Speaker 3>it down on the ground,</v>

4565
01:58:36.721 --> 01:58:37.650
<v Speaker 3>when it touches the ground,</v>

4566
01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:41.800
<v Speaker 3>like they show like safe levels in the air and they touch down in the ground and</v>

4567
01:58:41.801 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

4568
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 6>one guy on his Geiger counter,</v>

01:58:50.210 --> 01:58:51.650
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the Google maps?</v>

4574
01:58:51.651 --> 01:58:52.484

4576
01:58:56.031 --> 01:59:00.630

<v Speaker 5>just like a ghost town.</v>

4580
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:07.183
<v Speaker 5>It's really true.</v>

4581
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:10.760
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen the videos where they show the street like,</v>

4582
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:15.770
<v Speaker 6>like moving and breaking up where the ocean is underneath the street?</v>

4583
01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:16.311
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

4584
01:59:16.311 --> 01:59:16.670
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4591
01:59:28.941 --> 01:59:33.260
<v Speaker 6>they move back and forth and water comes out of cracks.</v>

4592
01:59:33.710 --> 01:59:37.130
<v Speaker 6>Like it still looks like streets and there's stills houses on it.</v>

4593
01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:38.180
<v Speaker 6>But it is,</v>

4600
01:59:50.321 --> 01:59:50.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4601
01:59:50.471 --> 01:59:52.570
<v Speaker 2>but instead of showing people falling and getting hurt,</v>

4602
01:59:52.571 --> 01:59:53.470
<v Speaker 2>just fucking shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That you found on the Internet.</v>

4605
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be hard to do.</v>

4606
01:59:56.410 --> 01:59:56.891
<v Speaker 2>I'd fuck it.</v>

4607
01:59:56.891 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Like every time you tweet something like,</v>

4608
01:59:58.331 --> 01:59:59.081
<v Speaker 2>has anyone seen this?</v>

4609
01:59:59.081 --> 01:59:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4612
02:00:00.691 --> 02:00:04.050
<v Speaker 6>one of the things about me retweeting a lot of things is that people will tweet</v>

4613
02:00:04.051 --> 02:00:05.040
<v Speaker 6>me a lot of cool shit.</v>

<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

4616
02:00:06.330 --> 02:00:08.460
<v Speaker 6>the reason why I can tweet all this stuff,</v>

4617
02:00:08.461 --> 02:00:11.520
<v Speaker 6>it's because people are constantly sending it to me knowing that if they send me</v>

4618
02:00:11.521 --> 02:00:12.181
<v Speaker 6>something cool,</v>

4735
02:02:44.770 --> 02:02:47.050
<v Speaker 1>but what they've got in Siberia,</v>

4881
02:07:03.681 --> 02:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4885
02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>How does it work?</v>

4886
02:07:07.641 --> 02:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4887
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.863
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

4888
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>What you're witnessing is the illusion of an illusion.</v>

4889
02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:12.291
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

4890
02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>the video is a fake you fucking dummies.</v>

4891
02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>This is a variation on a concept called Penn rose stairs created in 1959 which</v>

4892
02:07:21.981 --> 02:07:26.981
<v Speaker 1>itself has roots in an illusion created in the 1930s I'll get back to the rit</v>

4893
02:07:27.111 --> 02:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>stairwell in a moment,</v>

4894
02:07:28.101 --> 02:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>but let's trace the evolution of the illusion in 1934 switches,</v>

4895
02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Swedish graphic designer,</v>

4896
02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Oscar,</v>

4897
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:34.450
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

4898
02:07:34.450 --> 02:07:35.950
<v Speaker 1>My questions this don't break.com</v>

4899
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 3>created a series of optical illusions that we're all familiar with now created a</v>

4900
02:07:41.081 --> 02:07:45.520
<v Speaker 3>series of three d geometric figures that are only possible in two d space,</v>

4901
02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 3>and not only did he create impossible triangle,</v>

4902
02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:49.810
<v Speaker 3>you also created the impossible staircase.</v>

4903
02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:52.290
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works right there.</v>

4904
02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:52.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4905
02:07:52.591 --> 02:07:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's a slant and that's a little smart.</v>

4906
02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:55.930
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

4907
02:07:55.930 --> 02:07:56.763
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>

4908
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:57.491
<v Speaker 3>So you go up,</v>

4909
02:07:57.491 --> 02:07:58.390
<v Speaker 3>but you also come down.</v>

4910
02:07:58.391 --> 02:07:58.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4911
02:07:58.471 --> 02:07:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4912
02:07:59.060 --> 02:07:59.893
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>

4913
02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:00.880
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4914
02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:01.713

<v Speaker 3>Stupid as fuck.</v>

4917
02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.280
<v Speaker 3>If you looked at mom for building it,</v>

4918
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:07.510
<v Speaker 3>that guy's dumb for building it.</v>

4919
02:08:07.511 --> 02:08:08.880
<v Speaker 3>You're dumb for sweetening it.</v>

4920
02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's dumb as fuck.</v>

4921
02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:11.020
<v Speaker 3>If you looked,</v>

4922

4936
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:32.170
<v Speaker 3>this is true for like eight years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

4998
02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:00.401
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4999
02:10:00.401 --> 02:10:01.234
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>

5000
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I think would be a good move.</v>

5001
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:03.540
<v Speaker 3>So Mo,</v>

5002
02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I pitched it,</v>

5003
02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I pitched it to DIY that they have no one has a moat.</v>

5004
02:10:06.451 --> 02:10:06.640
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5005
02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

5006
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.430
<v Speaker 3>every key man's house is his castle.</v>

5007
02:10:08.431 --> 02:10:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Every castle needs a moat.</v>

5008
02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I fill in and you moved the fuck out of a house.</v>

5009
02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:12.870
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good idea.</v>

5010
02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:16.410
<v Speaker 3>And I think also what's a good idea is not ever needing a moat.</v>

5011
02:10:16.710 --> 02:10:17.760
<v Speaker 3>What's the good idea?</v>

5012
02:10:17.761 --> 02:10:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Is that the anti moat,</v>

5013
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:24.920
<v Speaker 3>the Anti Kingdom to let people know that somehow or another we have been tricked</v>

5014
02:10:25.021 --> 02:10:27.900
<v Speaker 3>into thinking that we need to be in battle with each other for in order for us</v>

5015
02:10:27.901 --> 02:10:30.210
<v Speaker 3>to be fruitful and survive and to do well.</v>

5016
02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:31.590
<v Speaker 3>And that shit is nonsense.</v>

5017
02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason why you need a moat is cause you need</v>

5018
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:37.700
<v Speaker 1>to believe that this sort of feudalist state and this ridiculous society that we</v>

5019
02:10:37.701 --> 02:10:40.910
<v Speaker 1>live in is going to maintain the way it is instead of just surrounding yourself</v>

5020
02:10:40.911 --> 02:10:44.480
<v Speaker 1>with a gigantic group of loving people and spread that out as much as possible.</v>

5021
02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:45.403
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

5022
02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>How would a motive love amount of love,</v>

5023
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:49.333
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

5024

<v Speaker 6>wasn't good enough</v>

5140
02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:45.280
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

5141
02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:48.040
<v Speaker 5>It sucks about these young kids that just go in and know how to do 20 minutes of</v>

5142
02:13:48.041 --> 02:13:50.770
<v Speaker 5>murder and aren't writing a bunch of growing up in Boston,</v>

5143
02:13:50.771 --> 02:13:51.131
<v Speaker 5>in New York,</v>

5144
02:13:51.131 --> 02:13:54.790
<v Speaker 5>you just wrote so much that you had bits that you go look back down when</v>

5145
02:13:54.791 --> 02:13:55.180
<v Speaker 5>revisit,</v>

5146
02:13:55.180 --> 02:13:56.013
<v Speaker 5>you're like damn</v>

5147
02:13:56.170 --> 02:13:56.411
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5148
02:13:56.411 --> 02:13:57.490
<v Speaker 6>it's hard when you start,</v>

5149
02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.301
<v Speaker 6>when will also,</v>

5150
02:13:58.301 --> 02:14:01.420
<v Speaker 6>when you're like trying to like make it as a standup comedian,</v>

5151
02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.480
<v Speaker 6>there's a real issue where people like you're scared to take any chances so you</v>

5152
02:14:08.501 --> 02:14:12.100
<v Speaker 6>lock into a few bits that you have a lot of confidence in and that you've done</v>

5153
02:14:12.130 --> 02:14:12.401
<v Speaker 6>many,</v>

5154
02:14:12.401 --> 02:14:12.971
<v Speaker 6>many times.</v>

5155
02:14:12.971 --> 02:14:16.660
<v Speaker 6>So you're pretty sure that work and it can become a real crutch.</v>

5156
02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:19.950
<v Speaker 6>It become a real bad thing for young guys and we,</v>

5157
02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:24.130
<v Speaker 6>we know those young guys and have that like 1520 minutes that just crush.</v>

5158
02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:28.930
<v Speaker 6>But then we know those sleeper dudes who aren't as attached to crushing as they</v>

5159
02:14:28.931 --> 02:14:31.240
<v Speaker 6>are to creating and those early Tripoli,</v>

5160
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:32.490
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God when I watch tripling,</v>

5161
02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:33.400
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say Bill Burr,</v>

5162
02:14:33.610 --> 02:14:34.210
<v Speaker 6>Bill Burr,</v>

5163
02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:35.530
<v Speaker 6>Bill burr too.</v>

5164
02:14:35.730 --> 02:14:36.180
<v Speaker 6>But no,</v>

5165
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.050
<v Speaker 6>but I love triple it because you didn't take some chances.</v>

5166
02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:38.561
<v Speaker 6>He does.</v>

5167
02:14:38.561 --> 02:14:42.220
<v Speaker 6>I think he's the guy that every fucking time takes a chance.</v>

5168
02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:46.150
<v Speaker 6>Bill burrs bills constantly writing bill was on the podcast.</v>

5169
02:14:46.151 --> 02:14:47.230
<v Speaker 6>One of the coolest things that he said,</v>

5170
02:14:47.530 --> 02:14:47.981
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

5171
02:14:47.981 --> 02:14:48.490
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5178
02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:52.601

02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:02.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5197
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:04.210
<v Speaker 5>Tosh said to me one time,</v>

5198
02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:05.141
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5199
02:15:05.141 --> 02:15:05.541
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>

5200
02:15:05.541 --> 02:15:05.770
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

5201
02:15:05.770 --> 02:15:06.730
<v Speaker 5>all your shit's knew.</v>

5202
02:15:06.731 --> 02:15:08.170
<v Speaker 5>And I felt like I didn't have it right that much.</v>

5203
02:15:08.171 --> 02:15:08.471
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

5204
02:15:08.471 --> 02:15:09.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5205
02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:09.371
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5206
02:15:09.371 --> 02:15:12.130
<v Speaker 5>but you're not in the position in your career where it matters.</v>

5207
02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.370
<v Speaker 5>Like you should go in and do the best show you can so that they come back next</v>

5208
02:15:15.370 --> 02:15:17.560
<v Speaker 5>year and then start complaining and say like,</v>

5209
02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:18.130
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5210
02:15:18.130 --> 02:15:18.461
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

5211
02:15:18.461 --> 02:15:20.320
<v Speaker 5>right now I'm at the place where if I don't write a new hour,</v>

5212
02:15:20.321 --> 02:15:21.700
<v Speaker 5>they'd feel like they'd gotten ripped off.</v>

5213
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:25.080
<v Speaker 6>You have to definitely write a lot of new shit,</v>

5214
02:15:25.081 --> 02:15:28.140
<v Speaker 6>but then people get pissed if you don't do certain classics.</v>

5215
02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:29.380
<v Speaker 6>But I always say I'm,</v>

5216
02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know how to do them anymore.</v>

5217
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:33.360
<v Speaker 6>Like I've had people yell out Duana Nicole Smith.</v>

5218
02:15:33.361 --> 02:15:33.870
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

5219
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:34.381
<v Speaker 6>listen man,</v>

5220
02:15:34.381 --> 02:15:36.030
<v Speaker 6>you could probably do it better than I could do it.</v>

5221
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 6>Cause I know when I was a kid,</v>

5222
02:15:37.411 --> 02:15:39.450
<v Speaker 6>when I was at like big Sam Kinison Fan,</v>

5223
02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 6>I could do a Sam Kinison bent.</v>

5224
02:15:41.730 --> 02:15:42.361
<v Speaker 6>Like if you,</v>

5225
02:15:42.361 --> 02:15:42.601
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

5226
02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:44.130
<v Speaker 6>if I had to like do it for a friend,</v>

5227
02:15:44.131 --> 02:15:45.030
<v Speaker 6>I could do it for a friend.</v>

5228
02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Your writing changed your,</v>

5229
02:15:46.981 --> 02:15:49.470
<v Speaker 5>your voice on stage has changed so much since that time.</v>

5230
02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:50.091
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5231
02:15:50.091 --> 02:15:50.241
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5232
02:15:50.241 --> 02:15:51.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm a different human being,</v>

5233
02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.160
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

5234
02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean I think it's really silly to try to stick with who you used to be,</v>

5235
02:15:57.150 --> 02:15:57.500
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

5236
02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:00.030
<v Speaker 6>Or to be a sort of uh,</v>

5237
02:16:00.070 --> 02:16:00.590
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5238
02:16:00.590 --> 02:16:05.590
<v Speaker 6>invested and not changing who you are or are not evolving or not adding new</v>

5239
02:16:05.931 --> 02:16:06.590
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

5240
02:16:06.590 --> 02:16:07.850
<v Speaker 6>I've seen a lot of people change,</v>

5241
02:16:07.851 --> 02:16:08.360
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5242
02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.850
<v Speaker 6>I just know a lot of people change.</v>

5243
02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:13.220
<v Speaker 6>I think change is a beautiful thing and I've seen Brian Chanes,</v>

5244
02:16:13.221 --> 02:16:14.750
<v Speaker 6>Eddie Bravo has changed the law.</v>

5245
02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:15.440
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5246
02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:18.710
<v Speaker 6>we had Dan Hardee in here last week and he was talking about his Iowasca</v>

5247
02:16:18.711 --> 02:16:19.350
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>

5248
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:21.150
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the best podcasts I've listened to.</v>

5249
02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

5250
02:16:21.690 --> 02:16:23.420
<v Speaker 5>I like the win.</v>

5251
02:16:23.610 --> 02:16:28.610
<v Speaker 5>I think when your podcast is at its best is when you take a guy like GSP or Dan</v>

5252
02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:30.393
<v Speaker 5>that I don't,</v>

5253
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't expect much other than maybe like some UFC conversation or some like</v>

5254
02:16:36.761 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 3>talking about some training stuff or like diet and then I done fucking blown</v>

5255
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:42.250
<v Speaker 3>away by what fascinating.</v>

5256
02:16:42.251 --> 02:16:43.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a reason.</v>

5257
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like Chael Sonnen,</v>

5258
02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 3>it really defines the UFC fighter in general is that they're not,</v>

5259
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:48.850
<v Speaker 3>they're more renaissance than they are.</v>

5260
02:16:49.210 --> 02:16:51.430
<v Speaker 3>This fighting is fighting is,</v>

5261
02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:54.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like all school fucking Ernest Hemingway put your dukes up.</v>

5262
02:16:54.731 --> 02:16:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

5263
02:16:55.090 --> 02:16:56.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not everywhere.</v>

5264
02:16:56.250 --> 02:16:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5265
02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:01.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like that Dan Hardee podcasts on the treadmill and I'm fucking googling,</v>

5266
02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:02.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5267
02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:06.250
<v Speaker 3>the Lee Marie Jo.</v>

5268
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:07.331
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>

5269
02:17:07.331 --> 02:17:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll get on a fucking plane,</v>

5270
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.990
<v Speaker 3>do a fucking visitor with that guy.</v>

5271
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.661
<v Speaker 3>He can,</v>

5272
02:17:10.661 --> 02:17:11.950
<v Speaker 3>he's in Morocco prison.</v>

5273
02:17:11.951 --> 02:17:15.020
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to go to Morocco and visit [inaudible] prison.</v>

5274
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:19.210
<v Speaker 3>They'll check your asshole with a microscope to look for what's chips.</v>

5275
02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:20.140
<v Speaker 3>What's the other dude?</v>

5276
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5277
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:21.210

02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:23.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5280
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.960
<v Speaker 3>wolf,</v>

5281
02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:24.793
<v Speaker 3>goddammit.</v>

5282
02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:29.970
<v Speaker 3>The other guy that was fucking just a beast that would sucker punch dudes and,</v>

5283
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.903
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

5284
02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>so it was like the second guy you talked about him and then they,</v>

5285
02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:34.120
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

5286
02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:34.953
<v Speaker 3>Bronson not,</v>

5287
02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:35.391
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5288
02:17:35.391 --> 02:17:35.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5289
02:17:35.710 --> 02:17:36.543
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

5290
02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:36.850
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

5291
02:17:36.850 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 3>but it was when you were talking about an MMA guy and I'm Omega Wolf,</v>

5292
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:40.721
<v Speaker 3>Tiger Wolf,</v>

5293
02:17:40.721 --> 02:17:41.020
<v Speaker 3>wolf,</v>

5294
02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

5295
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Something like that is not full of pussy.</v>

5296
02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

5297
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:44.081
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

5298
02:17:44.081 --> 02:17:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who you're telling.</v>

5299
02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:45.730
<v Speaker 3>You might've made some money up,</v>

5300
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:47.530
<v Speaker 3>somebody take medicine then go to sleep.</v>

5301
02:17:47.650 --> 02:17:47.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5302
02:17:47.891 --> 02:17:49.610
<v Speaker 3>but I was hung over jogging and I'm,</v>

5303
02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:51.650
<v Speaker 3>but Goddamn,</v>

5304
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:53.880
<v Speaker 3>and those two fucking interviews back to back world,</v>

5305
02:17:53.881 --> 02:17:55.060
<v Speaker 3>like he knew what it is.</v>

5306
02:17:55.061 --> 02:17:57.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like people don't get a chance.</v>

5307
02:17:57.130 --> 02:18:02.130
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare that people get a chance to sit down and really talk for like two</v>

5308
02:18:02.441 --> 02:18:03.280
<v Speaker 3>plus hours,</v>

5309
02:18:03.281 --> 02:18:04.210
<v Speaker 3>three hours.</v>

5310
02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5311
02:18:04.570 --> 02:18:05.530
<v Speaker 3>That time I couldn't,</v>

5312
02:18:05.531 --> 02:18:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I had to go with my kids to Disneyland was my daughter's birthday.</v>

5313
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:09.231
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

5314
02:18:09.231 --> 02:18:09.331
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5315
02:18:09.331 --> 02:18:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I had to take her to Disneyland so I could,</v>

5316
02:18:11.231 --> 02:18:12.520
<v Speaker 3>we could only do like two hours.</v>

5317
02:18:12.590 --> 02:18:13.450
<v Speaker 3>You should have Moen again,</v>

5318
02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:17.890
<v Speaker 3>dad for sure he's going to be on because we barely got to his,</v>

5319
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:18.161
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5320
02:18:18.161 --> 02:18:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca experience and everyone,</v>

5321
02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:20.271
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

5322
02:18:20.271 --> 02:18:20.741
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

5323
02:18:20.741 --> 02:18:20.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5324
02:18:20.921 --> 02:18:21.530
<v Speaker 3>he barely talked</v>

5325
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:21.920
<v Speaker 6>about that.</v>

5326
02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:22.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5327
02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:22.890
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>

5328
02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:23.641
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

5329
02:18:23.641 --> 02:18:24.181
<v Speaker 6>Like people,</v>

5330
02:18:24.181 --> 02:18:24.421
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

5331
02:18:24.421 --> 02:18:24.691
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

5332
02:18:24.691 --> 02:18:25.170
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

5333
02:18:25.170 --> 02:18:28.080
<v Speaker 6>that were bummed out about that is just because it was,</v>

5334
02:18:28.081 --> 02:18:29.400
<v Speaker 6>that's how the conversation went.</v>

5335
02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:32.190
<v Speaker 6>And this is something I want people to kind of understand when it comes to</v>

5336
02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:33.053
<v Speaker 6>podcasting.</v>

5337
02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:34.500
<v Speaker 6>I can,</v>

5338
02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:36.180
<v Speaker 6>I sometimes,</v>

5339
02:18:36.181 --> 02:18:36.601
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

5340
02:18:36.601 --> 02:18:37.111
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>

5341
02:18:37.111 --> 02:18:38.580
<v Speaker 6>Like sometimes like maybe,</v>

5342
02:18:38.581 --> 02:18:39.414
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5343
02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:44.660
<v Speaker 6>things go too much in one direction or not enough in another or one person talks</v>

5344
02:18:45.841 --> 02:18:46.680
<v Speaker 6>too much or,</v>

5345
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:50.760
<v Speaker 6>but the emphasis is always on trying to do the best show.</v>

5346
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:51.780
<v Speaker 6>So when you,</v>

5347
02:18:51.781 --> 02:18:54.210
<v Speaker 6>if you give like a criticism about that,</v>

5348
02:18:54.211 --> 02:18:54.631
<v Speaker 6>believe me,</v>

5349
02:18:54.631 --> 02:18:55.464
<v Speaker 6>I listened to that.</v>

5350
02:18:55.590 --> 02:18:56.340
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5351
02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:57.060
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5352
02:18:57.060 --> 02:18:58.260
<v Speaker 6>it's just Dan's my friend.</v>

5353
02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:02.430
<v Speaker 6>So what will you got to see was like me and Dan just shooting the shit and me</v>

5354
02:19:02.431 --> 02:19:04.110
<v Speaker 6>trying to get something out of him.</v>

5355
02:19:04.111 --> 02:19:04.801
<v Speaker 6>But we,</v>

5356
02:19:04.801 --> 02:19:09.780
<v Speaker 6>both of us having like points that we wanted to make and it's conversations like</v>

5357
02:19:09.781 --> 02:19:10.530
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

5358
02:19:10.530 --> 02:19:10.861
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5359
02:19:10.861 --> 02:19:14.700
<v Speaker 6>and you just sort of were there organically taking place completely naturally</v>

5360
02:19:14.701 --> 02:19:16.800
<v Speaker 6>taking place and you have anything planned out,</v>

5361
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:18.870
<v Speaker 6>but just a rough roadmap of where to go.</v>

5362
02:19:19.290 --> 02:19:21.480
<v Speaker 6>They don't always wind up,</v>

5363
02:19:21.930 --> 02:19:24.210
<v Speaker 6>especially when it's like only going to be a limited amount of time is two</v>

5364
02:19:24.211 --> 02:19:25.020
<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>

5365
02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:26.400
<v Speaker 6>They don't always wind up,</v>

5366
02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:26.880
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5367
02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:29.290
<v Speaker 6>where you want them to go or get everything in you want it to.</v>

5368
02:19:29.410 --> 02:19:31.240
<v Speaker 6>So that's why I said at the end of that podcast like,</v>

5369
02:19:31.241 --> 02:19:31.590
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

5370
02:19:31.590 --> 02:19:32.351
<v Speaker 6>we've got to do this again,</v>

5371
02:19:32.351 --> 02:19:33.184
<v Speaker 6>like two weeks.</v>

5372
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:34.900
<v Speaker 5>I heard you in the middle of say you go,</v>

5373
02:19:35.170 --> 02:19:35.891
<v Speaker 5>I know guys,</v>

5374
02:19:35.891 --> 02:19:36.790
<v Speaker 5>I'll get to the Iowa Ska,</v>

5375
02:19:36.791 --> 02:19:37.840
<v Speaker 5>but dead honest with you.</v>

5376
02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:41.380
<v Speaker 5>I had forgotten about the IOWASCA and I was interested in what you guys were</v>

5377
02:19:41.381 --> 02:19:46.090
<v Speaker 5>talking about and that's the way it podcasts at its best should go is just be,</v>

5378
02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:47.000
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5379
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.820
<v Speaker 5>and I'm telling you dead honestly from a guy who's done radio for fucking eight</v>

5380
02:19:51.821 --> 02:19:55.810
<v Speaker 5>years of going in and doing radio and you go in and you definitely Bam,</v>

5381
02:19:55.811 --> 02:19:56.081
<v Speaker 5>Bam,</v>

5382
02:19:56.081 --> 02:19:56.381
<v Speaker 5>Bam,</v>

5383
02:19:56.381 --> 02:19:56.710
<v Speaker 5>Bam,</v>

5384
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:57.970
<v Speaker 5>this is not that medium.</v>

5385
02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:01.120
<v Speaker 5>This medium is a new thing.</v>

5386
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:01.983
<v Speaker 5>It's almost a,</v>

5387
02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.830
<v Speaker 5>a new honesty that's uncomfortable as an entertainer.</v>

5388
02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:07.040
<v Speaker 6>It is uncomfortable.</v>

5389
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.690
<v Speaker 6>It's uncommon.</v>

5390
02:20:07.690 --> 02:20:09.140
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of it is uncomfortable.</v>

5391
02:20:09.350 --> 02:20:11.420
<v Speaker 6>It's uncomfortable to present it.</v>

5392
02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 6>It's uncomfortable to read the criticism.</v>

5393
02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:15.160
<v Speaker 6>It's uncomfortable to,</v>

5394
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.520
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5395
02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.360
<v Speaker 6>to try to analyze it and watch it.</v>

5396
02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:21.200
<v Speaker 6>But that's also what's really good about it because as much as it's</v>

5397
02:20:21.201 --> 02:20:23.270
<v Speaker 6>uncomfortable to be a part of it,</v>

5398
02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:25.310
<v Speaker 6>like it's very inspiring.</v>

5399
02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:27.440
<v Speaker 6>Podcasts are very inspiring for people.</v>

5400
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:31.340
<v Speaker 6>And even podcasts that aren't necessarily like this kind of podcasts.</v>

5401
02:20:31.341 --> 02:20:33.800
<v Speaker 6>Like I always go on and on about hardcore history,</v>

5402
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:34.161
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

5403
02:20:34.161 --> 02:20:36.500
<v Speaker 6>cause that's all I've been watching or listening to these days.</v>

5404
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:38.480
<v Speaker 6>All I listened to is Dan Carlin.</v>

5405
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:39.290
<v Speaker 6>Talk about Ma.</v>

5406
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:43.430
<v Speaker 6>I listened to the wrath of the cons no less than four times in a row,</v>

5407
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:44.900
<v Speaker 5>the whole five,</v>

5408
02:20:44.901 --> 02:20:46.040
<v Speaker 5>six part series,</v>

5409
02:20:46.310 --> 02:20:47.330
<v Speaker 5>five hours,</v>

5410
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:49.400
<v Speaker 5>and I've heard it no less than four times.</v>

5411
02:20:49.401 --> 02:20:50.960
<v Speaker 5>You talked to Eddie Wong about that.</v>

5412
02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:51.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5413
02:20:51.490 --> 02:20:53.240
<v Speaker 5>but that was a long time ago.</v>

5414
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:54.470
<v Speaker 5>But because you talked about it,</v>

5415
02:20:54.471 --> 02:20:56.660
<v Speaker 5>I started watching it about the cons and I was like,</v>

5416
02:20:56.800 --> 02:20:57.633
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker,</v>

5417
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.690
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

5418
02:20:58.690 --> 02:21:01.170
<v Speaker 6>the podcasts are amazing.</v>

5419
02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:05.160
<v Speaker 6>You can get something for free that's way better than anything you would pay</v>

5420
02:21:05.161 --> 02:21:05.910
<v Speaker 6>for.</v>

5421
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:10.020
<v Speaker 6>I love Opie and Anthony and I love Jimmy Norton and if it wasn't for them,</v>

5422
02:21:10.021 --> 02:21:11.310
<v Speaker 6>I would cancel serious.</v>

5423
02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:12.690
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't even have it.</v>

5424
02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:13.220
<v Speaker 5>I won't even,</v>

5425
02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:14.051
<v Speaker 5>I will say though this,</v>

5426
02:21:14.051 --> 02:21:15.550
<v Speaker 5>and I've said this to Sam and and,</v>

5427
02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:17.650
<v Speaker 5>and rolled into the two guys that worked there.</v>

5428
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:22.950
<v Speaker 5>I just wish I could get opie and Anthony and Howard and Howard and Howard and</v>

5429
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.370
<v Speaker 5>Ron,</v>

5430
02:21:23.370 --> 02:21:25.360
<v Speaker 5>any tenant and they to Ron fs.</v>

5431
02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:29.500
<v Speaker 5>I wish I didn't get them on demand the way I get them on your podcast because</v>

5432
02:21:29.501 --> 02:21:30.430
<v Speaker 5>when I get on a plane and I go,</v>

5433
02:21:30.431 --> 02:21:30.851
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

5434
02:21:30.851 --> 02:21:31.910
<v Speaker 5>I forgot to download podcasts,</v>

5435
02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:36.040
<v Speaker 5>I go to Stitcher and I just upload one and I and I let it load up and then I</v>

5436
02:21:36.041 --> 02:21:37.030
<v Speaker 5>listen for that to take off.</v>

5437
02:21:37.031 --> 02:21:38.380
<v Speaker 5>I usually pass out halfway through.</v>

5438
02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:41.140
<v Speaker 5>It's still up there to my list and I'll listen to the rest of it.</v>

5439
02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:43.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything wrong with the way,</v>

5440
02:21:43.461 --> 02:21:47.090
<v Speaker 6>like they say they do it in Howard TV or anything wrong with the way they do it</v>

5441
02:21:47.091 --> 02:21:48.290
<v Speaker 6>on the opiate Anthony Channel.</v>

5442
02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:52.130
<v Speaker 6>But I think they should also do it in a podcast form where you could download</v>

5443
02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:55.310
<v Speaker 6>anyone you want at anytime you want and they probably do.</v>

5444
02:21:55.311 --> 02:21:56.240
<v Speaker 6>And we're just talking shit.</v>

5445
02:21:56.370 --> 02:21:56.461
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5446
02:21:56.461 --> 02:21:57.530
<v Speaker 5>it's on audible.com and,</v>

5447
02:21:57.570 --> 02:21:58.500
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not a big fan.</v>

5448
02:21:58.740 --> 02:21:59.760
<v Speaker 5>You don't like audible?</v>

5449
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.823
<v Speaker 5>I love audible.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:12.550
<v Speaker 5>I got a boat because I heard it so many times.</v>

5459
02:22:12.551 --> 02:22:13.590
<v Speaker 5>So like this is fucking awesome.</v>

5460
02:22:13.650 --> 02:22:16.320
<v Speaker 5>Greg Fitzsimmons is the guy I used his login.</v>

5461
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:18.870
<v Speaker 5>It turns out you've got to buy points to buy the books.</v>

5462
02:22:18.871 --> 02:22:20.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to buy the fucking points.</v>

5463
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:21.450
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking about?</v>

5464
02:22:21.450 --> 02:22:23.120
<v Speaker 5>The way audible worked from?</v>

5465
02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:27.090
<v Speaker 5>From from me and then now I'm not talking a opie and Anthony where you just go</v>

5466
02:22:27.091 --> 02:22:28.230
<v Speaker 5>and you buy like for a dollar.</v>

5467
02:22:28.231 --> 02:22:29.070
<v Speaker 5>You got their episode,</v>

5468
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:34.550
<v Speaker 5>but audible worked where you had to buy like get 20 it was all on my phone so I</v>

5469
02:22:35.371 --> 02:22:36.510
<v Speaker 5>can only speak from my phone,</v>

5470
02:22:36.511 --> 02:22:37.020
<v Speaker 5>but it was like,</v>

5471
02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:37.350
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5472
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:37.771
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

5473
02:22:37.771 --> 02:22:39.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to buy an audible book.</v>

5474
02:22:39.210 --> 02:22:40.200
<v Speaker 5>Greg Fitzsimmons talking about,</v>

5475
02:22:40.201 --> 02:22:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know Greg at all whenever even met the dude but it,</v>

5476
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:43.960
<v Speaker 5>but I trusted him.</v>

5477
02:22:43.961 --> 02:22:44.040
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

5478
02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.960
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like actually listens to fucking books.</v>

5479
02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:51.010
<v Speaker 5>So I go and I fucking by the points I go on and I go to get the audible account</v>

5480
02:22:51.011 --> 02:22:53.760
<v Speaker 5>and I think I'll just go get an audible account and I'll get it.</v>

5481
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:54.401
<v Speaker 5>You got to boy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you can sign in with your Amazon account too.</v>

5484
02:22:57.601 --> 02:22:59.040
<v Speaker 5>You know I don't have an Amazon account,</v>

5485
02:22:59.041 --> 02:22:59.221
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't like super.</v>

5490
02:23:02.791 --> 02:23:03.300
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

5491
02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:05.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm not super technological like that.</v>

5492
02:23:05.370 --> 02:23:06.180
<v Speaker 6>That's so easy though.</v>

5493
02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:06.361
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

5494
02:23:06.361 --> 02:23:06.991
<v Speaker 6>but Amazon,</v>

5495
02:23:06.991 --> 02:23:07.471
<v Speaker 6>Amazon,</v>

5496
02:23:07.471 --> 02:23:08.400
<v Speaker 6>one click is like,</v>

5497
02:23:08.610 --> 02:23:11.400
<v Speaker 6>I've used it on so many sites that aren't even Amazon sites.</v>

5498
02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:13.900
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know what Amazon one click.</v>

5499
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:15.210
<v Speaker 6>It's not making anything from Amazon.</v>

5500
02:23:15.211 --> 02:23:15.811
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you right now,</v>

5501
02:23:15.811 --> 02:23:16.740
<v Speaker 6>Amazon is the shit.</v>

5502
02:23:16.770 --> 02:23:18.000
<v Speaker 6>What does am I am grace.</v>

5503
02:23:18.001 --> 02:23:18.690
<v Speaker 6>Amazon.</v>

5504
02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:19.440
<v Speaker 6>You know why?</v>

5505
02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:20.273
<v Speaker 6>Because there's a lot of,</v>

5506
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:20.700
<v Speaker 6>here's,</v>

5507
02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:21.690
<v Speaker 6>here's a perfect example.</v>

5508
02:23:22.470 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 6>Billiards and pool.</v>

5509
02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.740
<v Speaker 6>I play with two different types of cues,</v>

5510
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:29.100
<v Speaker 6>played with a 13 millimeter and sometimes the 12 and three quarters millimeter</v>

5511
02:23:29.310 --> 02:23:32.940
<v Speaker 6>depending on how often I'm playing or whether or not I don't want to adjust my</v>

5512
02:23:32.941 --> 02:23:33.630
<v Speaker 6>game.</v>

5513
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:34.740
<v Speaker 6>But when I'm looking at a queue,</v>

5514
02:23:34.741 --> 02:23:37.680
<v Speaker 6>it's very hard to tell the difference between a 12 and three quarters and the 13</v>

5515
02:23:37.681 --> 02:23:38.220
<v Speaker 6>millimeter.</v>

5516
02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:39.990
<v Speaker 6>So I buy some fucking calipers,</v>

5517
02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:43.950
<v Speaker 6>millimeter calipers and I get them and then I fit it over the tip.</v>

5518
02:23:43.951 --> 02:23:46.240
<v Speaker 6>And I know exactly what and then I mark it.</v>

5519
02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:48.000
<v Speaker 6>Where the fuck am I going to find that?</v>

5520
02:23:48.001 --> 02:23:52.950
<v Speaker 6>If I'm not going to get it on amazon.com I get it on amazon.com is 13 seconds.</v>

5521
02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:55.620
<v Speaker 6>I type in millimeter Caliper,</v>

5522
02:23:55.621 --> 02:23:56.041
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

5523
02:23:56.041 --> 02:23:56.730
<v Speaker 6>One Click,</v>

5524
02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:57.570
<v Speaker 6>yes please.</v>

5525
02:23:58.140 --> 02:23:58.800
<v Speaker 6>Boom,</v>

5526
02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.850
<v Speaker 6>it sends to my house.</v>

5527
02:23:59.851 --> 02:24:00.511
<v Speaker 6>I open it,</v>

5528
02:24:00.511 --> 02:24:00.811
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

5529
02:24:00.811 --> 02:24:01.650
<v Speaker 6>I now I have it.</v>

5530
02:24:01.651 --> 02:24:03.120
<v Speaker 6>I have these millimeter calipers.</v>

5531
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:06.060
<v Speaker 6>I will never go against Amazon unless they go evil.</v>

5532
02:24:06.090 --> 02:24:09.630
<v Speaker 6>Unless Amazon becomes a tool of of skynet.</v>

5533
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:11.243
<v Speaker 6>Until then</v>

5534
02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:15.740
<v Speaker 5>there is something very powerful with with that one click like Uber,</v>

5535
02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:17.190
<v Speaker 5>Uber,</v>

5536
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.811
<v Speaker 5>Uber's Oss.</v>

5537
02:24:17.811 --> 02:24:19.550
<v Speaker 5>I use Uber all the time.</v>

5538
02:24:19.551 --> 02:24:20.750
<v Speaker 5>People don't know what Uber Is.</v>

5539
02:24:20.751 --> 02:24:21.584
<v Speaker 5>I used Uber</v>

5540
02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:23.080
<v Speaker 6>the first time when I was in Manhattan.</v>

5541
02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:24.520
<v Speaker 6>It's a credible you.</v>

5542
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:25.181
<v Speaker 6>It's incredible.</v>

5543
02:24:25.181 --> 02:24:25.840
<v Speaker 6>You can grate it.</v>

5544
02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:26.820
<v Speaker 6>You use a,</v>

5545
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:27.730
<v Speaker 6>it's like a,</v>

5546
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:30.310
<v Speaker 6>you know like a town car or limo or something like that.</v>

5547
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:31.503
<v Speaker 6>More expensive,</v>

5548
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:32.770
<v Speaker 6>more expensive than a taxi,</v>

5549
02:24:32.771 --> 02:24:33.790
<v Speaker 6>but way better.</v>

5550
02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:38.050
<v Speaker 6>And they pick you up and they're gentlemen and everyone's nice and kind and they</v>

5551
02:24:38.051 --> 02:24:40.030
<v Speaker 6>all want to impress you with like how,</v>

5552
02:24:40.031 --> 02:24:43.600
<v Speaker 6>what a good service Uber is because the more the better job they do in,</v>

5553
02:24:43.601 --> 02:24:44.261
<v Speaker 6>the nicer they are,</v>

5554
02:24:44.261 --> 02:24:45.094
<v Speaker 6>the more likely you already</v>

5555
02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:46.790
<v Speaker 5>use it to there their Yelp,</v>

5556
02:24:46.970 --> 02:24:48.560
<v Speaker 5>it's five star or one star.</v>

5557
02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:53.270
<v Speaker 5>I do gave a dude one star one time because I ordered an Uber from my parents and</v>

5558
02:24:53.271 --> 02:24:57.570
<v Speaker 5>I was so proud of it and he showed up in a fucking Celica with food in the his</v>

5559
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:58.370
<v Speaker 5>trunk and I went,</v>

5560
02:24:58.370 --> 02:24:58.780

<v Speaker 5>you're over.</v>

5563
02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:02.630
<v Speaker 5>And apparently there's a new thing where you can get on Uber.</v>

5564
02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:03.950
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to get a town car,</v>

5565
02:25:03.951 --> 02:25:05.030
<v Speaker 5>you can get like a taxis,</v>

5566
02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:09.530
<v Speaker 5>crazy creep driving you around with his fucking pizza stewing in the trunk.</v>

5567
02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:09.741
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5568
02:25:09.741 --> 02:25:10.960
<v Speaker 5>you get a town car driver.</v>

5569
02:25:10.961 --> 02:25:12.590
<v Speaker 5>He uses his own car and just drives you.</v>

5570
02:25:12.591 --> 02:25:14.780
<v Speaker 5>There it is for those people that may not have,</v>

5571
02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:15.440
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5572
02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:15.651
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

5573
02:25:15.651 --> 02:25:16.520
<v Speaker 5>not that I have a ton of money,</v>

5574
02:25:16.521 --> 02:25:19.910
<v Speaker 5>but like for those people that may not have like a ton of money,</v>

5575
02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:20.710
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

5576
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:21.110
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5577
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:22.160
<v Speaker 5>it's actually a viable option.</v>

5578
02:25:22.161 --> 02:25:23.000
<v Speaker 5>It's a little sketchy if you're a,</v>

5579
02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:23.921
<v Speaker 5>if you're a dude,</v>

5580
02:25:23.921 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

5581
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:24.873
<v Speaker 3>not a bad deal.</v>

5582
02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:27.180
<v Speaker 3>But Celica a little bit of like,</v>

5583
02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I sound like I just used that name,</v>

5584
02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it was,</v>

5585
02:25:29.861 --> 02:25:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Sonata or something.</v>

5586
02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:32.883
<v Speaker 3>Come on Joe.</v>

5587
02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 3>You to pick apart by stories.</v>

5588
02:25:35.010 --> 02:25:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Funny thing though that you have to look at check as to really worry for a dude.</v>

5589
02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:40.361
<v Speaker 3>You know a dude,</v>

5590
02:25:40.361 --> 02:25:41.021
<v Speaker 3>it's sketchy,</v>

5591
02:25:41.021 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's like no one's trying to fuck you on the normal oh fuck dude into your</v>

5592
02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:46.400
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

5593
02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5594
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:47.973
<v Speaker 3>With the premise,</v>

5595
02:25:48.270 --> 02:25:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I want to fuck,</v>

5596
02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:51.310
<v Speaker 3>let's just have fun.</v>

5597
02:25:51.430 --> 02:25:52.560
<v Speaker 3>This is where I live.</v>

5598
02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Spend the night here while,</v>

5599
02:25:54.371 --> 02:25:56.680
<v Speaker 3>and assuming that the dude is not a Dickhead,</v>

5600
02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:59.530
<v Speaker 3>assuming the dude is not going to do something horrible and you know,</v>

5601
02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:01.143
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

5602
02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:02.181
<v Speaker 3>being a woman,</v>

5603
02:26:02.181 --> 02:26:03.100
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be way harder.</v>

5604
02:26:03.101 --> 02:26:05.320
<v Speaker 3>When you hear shit about this kidnapping thing,</v>

5605
02:26:05.470 --> 02:26:07.710
<v Speaker 3>he never heard about a guy getting kidnapped for 10 years,</v>

5606
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:09.380
<v Speaker 3>forced him to fuck some check little boy.</v>

5607
02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:11.410
<v Speaker 3>So Adam Walsh.</v>

5608
02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5609
02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:15.120
<v Speaker 3>by Dude's kidnapped by dudes.</v>

5610
02:26:15.121 --> 02:26:16.240
<v Speaker 3>So not kidnapped by women.</v>

5611
02:26:16.290 --> 02:26:17.140
<v Speaker 3>That's what my point is.</v>

5612
02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:18.910
<v Speaker 3>It's way harder to be a woman,</v>

5613
02:26:19.330 --> 02:26:19.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5614
02:26:19.661 --> 02:26:20.980
<v Speaker 3>and to deal with men.</v>

5615
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Men are creeps that creeps demand and they're creeps to women.</v>

5616
02:26:24.071 --> 02:26:24.904
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

5617
02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:27.670
<v Speaker 3>That is the number one issue with our world.</v>

5618
02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:29.333
<v Speaker 3>Conti men.</v>

5619
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:32.740
<v Speaker 3>If we could cut cunty men like Morrissey once said,</v>

5620
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:34.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a really annoying thing.</v>

5621
02:26:34.271 --> 02:26:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about it on say,</v>

5622
02:26:35.530 --> 02:26:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I love saying that once.</v>

5623
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:38.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way to start a quote.</v>

5624
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I even have a joke about it.</v>

5625
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.721
<v Speaker 3>He said that,</v>

5626
02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:41.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5627
02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.400
<v Speaker 3>that gay,</v>

5628
02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:42.681
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5629
02:26:42.681 --> 02:26:42.970
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

5630
02:26:42.970 --> 02:26:43.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5631
02:26:43.121 --> 02:26:43.931
<v Speaker 3>fall people were gay,</v>

5632
02:26:43.931 --> 02:26:45.100
<v Speaker 3>there wouldn't be any war.</v>

5633
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:46.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like people look at it,</v>

5634
02:26:46.991 --> 02:26:49.030
<v Speaker 3>things like that because they think that it's,</v>

5635
02:26:49.031 --> 02:26:49.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

5636
02:26:49.390 --> 02:26:51.130
<v Speaker 3>it has nothing to do with heterosexuality.</v>

5637
02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Nothing or,</v>

5638
02:26:52.061 --> 02:26:52.900
<v Speaker 3>and the contempt is,</v>

5639
02:26:52.901 --> 02:26:55.100
<v Speaker 3>theater has nothing to do with heterosexual,</v>

5640
02:26:55.570 --> 02:26:57.460
<v Speaker 3>but it does have to do with men.</v>

5641
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:59.770
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with asshole men.</v>

5642
02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.970
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't mean that all men are assholes and that's where things get weird.</v>

5643
02:27:03.971 --> 02:27:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Like I got in this dispute with a bunch of feminists and uh,</v>

5644
02:27:08.861 --> 02:27:13.650
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I said I was making fun of male feminists because uh,</v>

5645
02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:15.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of male feminists that I always,</v>

5646
02:27:15.970 --> 02:27:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I liken them to vampire familiars so if they just trying to get close to the</v>

5647
02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:21.250
<v Speaker 3>WWE,</v>

5648
02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:22.050
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

5649
02:27:22.050 --> 02:27:23.620
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any appeal with women.</v>

5650
02:27:23.621 --> 02:27:24.190
<v Speaker 3>So they like,</v>

5651
02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:29.190
<v Speaker 3>they change who they are and adopt for what like really powerful women want won</v>

5652
02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:33.760
<v Speaker 3>his battle with you because I saw that go down on Twitter.</v>

5653
02:27:33.761 --> 02:27:38.170
<v Speaker 3>But the truth is did you not live enough of a life of a man?</v>

5654
02:27:38.390 --> 02:27:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Like as a man where you,</v>

5655
02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:40.900
<v Speaker 3>at one point you start saying,</v>

5656
02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm very empathetic to all women's rights.</v>

5657
02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I have two daughters and a wife.</v>

5658
02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:47.890
<v Speaker 3>All my animals are female.</v>

5659
02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:50.230
<v Speaker 3>But like I did grow up a boy.</v>

5660
02:27:50.290 --> 02:27:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I was a boy in my whole fucking life and I felt what that felt like.</v>

5661
02:27:53.321 --> 02:27:57.400
<v Speaker 3>And I will always identify with being a man first and not a woman first.</v>

5662
02:27:57.401 --> 02:28:00.700
<v Speaker 3>There are some guys that almost identify with women before they identify with</v>

5663
02:28:00.701 --> 02:28:01.390
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

5664
02:28:01.390 --> 02:28:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5665
02:28:02.010 --> 02:28:02.940
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

5666
02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.410
<v Speaker 3>well there's a lot of gender traders,</v>

5667
02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:08.410
<v Speaker 3>both on the female side and on the men's side.</v>

5668
02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.900
<v Speaker 3>All these feminist identify with being a women woman.</v>

5669
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.890
<v Speaker 3>You're going,</v>

5670
02:28:11.890 --> 02:28:15.610
<v Speaker 3>me to a gal that I was dating once said to me,</v>

5671
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:16.750
<v Speaker 3>never trust a girl,</v>

5672
02:28:16.751 --> 02:28:18.160
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any girlfriends.</v>

5673
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:19.391
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

5674
02:28:19.391 --> 02:28:20.224
<v Speaker 3>why do you say that?</v>

5675
02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:21.261
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

5676
02:28:21.261 --> 02:28:22.094
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

5677
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.700
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5678
02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:25.250
<v Speaker 6>every girl knows that guys want to fuck them.</v>

5679
02:28:25.251 --> 02:28:25.970
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5680
02:28:25.970 --> 02:28:26.301
<v Speaker 6>And I go,</v>

5681
02:28:26.301 --> 02:28:26.960
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5682
02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:27.590
<v Speaker 6>And I go,</v>

5683
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:29.060
<v Speaker 6>and the girls don't want to fuck it.</v>

5684
02:28:29.061 --> 02:28:29.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5685
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:30.051
<v Speaker 6>And she goes,</v>

5686
02:28:30.051 --> 02:28:30.410
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5687
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:31.010
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>

5688
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:31.131
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5689
02:28:31.131 --> 02:28:32.120
<v Speaker 6>how come they don't like you?</v>

5690
02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:35.810
<v Speaker 6>Girls don't like that girl.</v>

5691
02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:37.280
<v Speaker 6>She doesn't have any girlfriends.</v>

5692
02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:39.260
<v Speaker 6>So it's one or two things have happened.</v>

5693
02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:44.030
<v Speaker 6>Either you just moved into town or you fucked everybody's boyfriend.</v>

5694
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:45.403
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

5695
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:46.640

02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And then the other chick,</v>

5705
02:29:04.951 --> 02:29:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Ma,</v>

5706
02:29:05.490 --> 02:29:06.091
<v Speaker 3>don't hit me.</v>

5707
02:29:06.091 --> 02:29:06.924
<v Speaker 3>I got to go.</v>

5708
02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:11.460
<v Speaker 3>That should be a short series Joe Rogan's defining moments</v>

5709
02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:14.640
<v Speaker 3>a moment like that.</v>

5710
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:15.541
<v Speaker 3>That was a good one.</v>

5711
02:29:15.541 --> 02:29:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Man dropped some serious knowledge on me.</v>

5712
02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:20.130
<v Speaker 3>She dropped some serious knowledge on me.</v>

5713
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:22.920
<v Speaker 3>She looked me in the eyes when she said it too.</v>

5714
02:29:22.921 --> 02:29:24.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like a really strong move.</v>

5715
02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:25.150
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

5716
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:27.340
<v Speaker 6>don't ever trust a girl who doesn't have any girlfriends.</v>

5717
02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:30.470
<v Speaker 6>And I remember I seen him cause I,</v>

5718
02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:32.140
<v Speaker 6>I remember saying to our goal,</v>

5719
02:29:32.410 --> 02:29:35.620
<v Speaker 6>I was like cocky because I was like 24 when she said this.</v>

5720
02:29:36.010 --> 02:29:36.401
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

5721
02:29:36.401 --> 02:29:36.731
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

5722
02:29:36.731 --> 02:29:38.220
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck you is say,</v>

5723
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.441
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

02:29:38.441 --> 02:29:39.090

02:29:39.090 --> 02:29:39.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5726
02:29:39.281 --> 02:29:41.020
<v Speaker 6>some girls are assholes and,</v>

5727
02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:42.250
<v Speaker 6>and then I just,</v>

5728
02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:42.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5729
02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:43.420
<v Speaker 6>when she,</v>

5730
02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:44.380
<v Speaker 6>after she said that,</v>

5731
02:29:44.410 --> 02:29:45.243
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>

5732
02:29:45.460 --> 02:29:48.430
<v Speaker 6>the girls know who you are,</v>

5733
02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:49.413
<v Speaker 6>they know who you are.</v>

5734
02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:50.471
<v Speaker 6>And I just went,</v>

5735
02:29:50.471 --> 02:29:51.280
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

5736
02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:52.330
<v Speaker 6>I can't even argue with you.</v>

5737
02:29:52.770 --> 02:29:53.603

5740
02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Bordain put trees.</v>

5741
02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.090

5742
02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

5743
02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Marjorie said to me one night here,</v>

02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:11.070
<v Speaker 2>the phone talking to his black dude and we're sitting in the bag of then blow</v>

5746
02:30:11.861 --> 02:30:12.511
<v Speaker 2>We're sitting down,</v>

5747
02:30:12.511 --> 02:30:15.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a bench in the corner by the window and we're sitting,</v>

5748
02:30:15.001 --> 02:30:15.360
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

5749

<v Speaker 2>we're sitting talking and he's watching me the whole time and I just recently</v>

5750
02:30:18.151 --> 02:30:19.770
<v Speaker 2>tried to just grow a beard for the first time.</v>

5751
02:30:20.370 --> 02:30:21.320
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5752
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:22.290
<v Speaker 2>we get up,</v>

5753
02:30:22.290 --> 02:30:23.880
<v Speaker 2>the guy gets up and he moves.</v>

5754
02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Patrice sits down next to me was the fuck you doing talking to him.</v>

5755
02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:27.391
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5756
02:30:27.391 --> 02:30:27.771
<v Speaker 2>what you have?</v>

5757
02:30:27.771 --> 02:30:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever talk to a black man that doesn't have facial hair?</v>

5758
02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:33.250
<v Speaker 2>What's this have to do with it?</v>

5759
02:30:33.251 --> 02:30:33.551
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

5760
02:30:33.551 --> 02:30:34.384
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>

5761
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:35.543
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

5762
02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Any black man</v>

5763
02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:39.670
<v Speaker 2>has a facial hair.</v>

5764
02:30:39.671 --> 02:30:40.504
<v Speaker 2>We grew up</v>

5765
02:30:41.410 --> 02:30:42.480
<v Speaker 3>so hilarious.</v>

5766
02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Fucking great.</v>

5767
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:45.640
<v Speaker 3>And then I started bombing around in every black dude.</v>

5768
02:30:45.641 --> 02:30:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I knew how to facial hair.</v>

5769
02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:49.690
<v Speaker 3>It was like the greatest little fucking.</v>

5770
02:30:49.950 --> 02:30:50.351
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

5771
02:30:50.351 --> 02:30:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Patrice</v>

5772
02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:51.920
<v Speaker 6>didn't even believe that.</v>

5773
02:30:51.921 --> 02:30:53.540
<v Speaker 6>He was only saying that because it was the funny thing.</v>

5774
02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:54.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a bug with me.</v>

5775
02:30:55.050 --> 02:30:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time he goes,</v>

5776
02:30:56.770 --> 02:30:59.930
<v Speaker 2>you got to learn how to trim your lip because I was white guys,</v>

5777
02:30:59.931 --> 02:31:02.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll let the hair grow into their lip and black guys don't do that.</v>

5778
02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Dates up on the lip.</v>

5779
02:31:03.970 --> 02:31:05.050
<v Speaker 6>Patrice and I had,</v>

5780
02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.410
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5781
02:31:05.410 --> 02:31:06.790
<v Speaker 6>a couple of cool moments,</v>

5782
02:31:06.791 --> 02:31:08.860
<v Speaker 6>but one of the coolest ones was I wasn't even in the room.</v>

5783
02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:13.390
<v Speaker 6>I called up opie and Anthony and a w it was Louis and,</v>

5784
02:31:13.410 --> 02:31:13.440
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5785
02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:14.730
<v Speaker 6>Patrice and uh,</v>

5786
02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:17.950
<v Speaker 6>Anthony and opie and Anthony was talking about guns.</v>

5787
02:31:17.951 --> 02:31:19.410
<v Speaker 6>Like we're talking about guns and he's,</v>

5788
02:31:19.411 --> 02:31:19.561
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

5789
02:31:19.561 --> 02:31:22.320
<v Speaker 6>he worries always about about being attacked and all this different.</v>

5790
02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:23.040
<v Speaker 6>And I go,</v>

5791
02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.770
<v Speaker 6>don't you worry that like maybe your,</v>

5792
02:31:25.780 --> 02:31:29.010
<v Speaker 6>your manifesting this with you with your own.</v>

5793
02:31:29.011 --> 02:31:31.800
<v Speaker 6>Like if you have reality and you're all focus on that,</v>

5794
02:31:31.801 --> 02:31:35.040
<v Speaker 6>you're manifesting an attack and that Patrice goes on.</v>

5795
02:31:35.041 --> 02:31:37.860
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan see Joe Rogan knows about magic.</v>

5796
02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:42.030

02:31:42.361 --> 02:31:45.030
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe Patrice is goofing on what I just said.</v>

5799
02:31:45.031 --> 02:31:45.841
<v Speaker 6>This is beautiful.</v>

5800
02:31:45.841 --> 02:31:46.674
<v Speaker 6>It's an honor.</v>

<v Speaker 6>if you don't know if Freddy Soto was Freddy Soto is a lost treasure.</v>

5873
02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:20.810
<v Speaker 6>This is a few guys that I've met in my life and had like this,</v>

5874
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:26.290
<v Speaker 6>this really undeniable charisma where like if I knew that he was going to be</v>

<v Speaker 6>performing,</v>

5876
02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:28.790
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>

5877
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:29.361
<v Speaker 6>I would find,</v>

5878
02:33:29.361 --> 02:33:29.571
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5879
02:33:29.571 --> 02:33:30.440
<v Speaker 6>we were outside,</v>

5880
02:33:30.470 --> 02:33:32.960
<v Speaker 6>like the comedy store was a weird place where like,</v>

5881
02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.411
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5882
02:33:33.411 --> 02:33:37.190
<v Speaker 6>sometimes a guy would be on stage and you'd like the guy but he didn't want to</v>

5883
02:33:37.191 --> 02:33:37.970
<v Speaker 6>watch.</v>

5884
02:33:37.970 --> 02:33:39.290
<v Speaker 6>But Freddy,</v>

5885
02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:40.610
<v Speaker 6>I would go in,</v>

5886
02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:42.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean I wouldn't watch all of his sets.</v>

5887
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:43.280
<v Speaker 6>I didn't watch anybody.</v>

5888
02:33:43.310 --> 02:33:46.610
<v Speaker 6>All of their sites cause it was too fun to be outside in the parking lot.</v>

5889
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:49.910
<v Speaker 6>But there was a lot of guys who are going every few months to see what's going</v>

5890
02:33:49.911 --> 02:33:50.270
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

5891
02:33:50.270 --> 02:33:51.320
<v Speaker 6>see what's going on with Freddy.</v>

5892
02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:53.030
<v Speaker 6>And Freddy always had something going on.</v>

5893
02:33:53.031 --> 02:33:54.650
<v Speaker 6>He was always on some new angle.</v>

5894
02:33:54.890 --> 02:33:58.160
<v Speaker 6>He was always a developing his delivery.</v>

5895
02:33:58.161 --> 02:33:59.810
<v Speaker 6>He was always getting a little sharper.</v>

5896
02:34:00.250 --> 02:34:01.200
<v Speaker 6>He's just had a,</v>

5897
02:34:01.210 --> 02:34:06.210
<v Speaker 6>a beautiful presence like on stage and knowing the dude from like real life.</v>

5898
02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:10.460
<v Speaker 6>We're all a fraternity of Weirdos,</v>

5899
02:34:10.461 --> 02:34:11.180
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

<v Speaker 6>like standup comedians or if you the worst torture ever for standup comedian</v>

5902
02:34:17.981 --> 02:34:20.770
<v Speaker 6>would be no comedians for the rest of your life.</v>

5903
02:34:21.310 --> 02:34:22.540
<v Speaker 6>Only accountants.</v>

5904
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:25.810
<v Speaker 6>Only accountants and lawyers forever.</v>

<v Speaker 6>of cool ass lawyers.</v>

5909
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:36.030
<v Speaker 6>But what are the odds that you run on to one of them most likely going to run</v>

5910
02:34:36.941 --> 02:34:38.680

5949
02:35:20.761 --> 02:35:22.300
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny because you know,</v>

5950
02:35:22.470 --> 02:35:24.240
<v Speaker 2>that could be written off as like,</v>

5951
02:35:24.570 --> 02:35:24.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5952
02:35:24.691 --> 02:35:26.430
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's like to be a young Mexican man.</v>

5953
02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:26.881
<v Speaker 2>But it's not,</v>

5954
02:35:26.881 --> 02:35:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

5955
02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it's what it seems to be a young man,</v>

5956
02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:29.131
<v Speaker 2>the young man,</v>

5957
02:35:29.131 --> 02:35:30.960
<v Speaker 2>and you just saw it painted in his colors.</v>

5958
02:35:31.170 --> 02:35:32.730
<v Speaker 2>But I dealt with that with my dad.</v>

5959
02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:36.060
<v Speaker 2>But in the same way of your dad being wrong and it was so beautiful.</v>

5960
02:35:36.061 --> 02:35:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Such a beautiful joke.</v>

5961
02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:37.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5962
02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:38.970
<v Speaker 2>That was where it connected.</v>

5963
02:35:38.971 --> 02:35:39.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5964
02:35:39.151 --> 02:35:42.870
<v Speaker 2>that's where bill Cosby stuff connected with a lot of white people back when</v>

5965
02:35:42.871 --> 02:35:44.790
<v Speaker 2>people weren't listening to the black people talk.</v>

5966
02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:46.800
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it was.</v>

5967
02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:48.630
<v Speaker 6>It's just that he,</v>

5968
02:35:48.631 --> 02:35:50.600
<v Speaker 6>he hit a note that Edd,</v>

5969
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:51.620
<v Speaker 6>it was universal.</v>

5970
02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:52.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5971
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.371
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5972
02:35:52.371 --> 02:35:53.870
<v Speaker 6>and what you saw was,</v>

5973
02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:54.741
<v Speaker 6>hey look,</v>

5974
02:35:54.741 --> 02:35:55.790
<v Speaker 6>we all grew up.</v>

5975
02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:59.240
<v Speaker 6>I mean everybody grew up either everybody's alive today,</v>

5976
02:35:59.241 --> 02:36:04.241
<v Speaker 6>either grew up in pushing it as the forties it's the fifties sixties seventies</v>

5977
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:08.360
<v Speaker 6>eighties nineties and two thousands that's it.</v>

5978
02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:11.360
<v Speaker 6>And most likely the older you are,</v>

5979
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:12.920
<v Speaker 6>most likely the older,</v>

5980
02:36:13.010 --> 02:36:14.030
<v Speaker 6>the older you are,</v>

5981
02:36:14.031 --> 02:36:16.060
<v Speaker 6>the dumb or your parents were when they raised here.</v>

5982
02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:16.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5983
02:36:16.850 --> 02:36:18.400
<v Speaker 6>Because people were just dumb or them.</v>

5984
02:36:18.470 --> 02:36:19.730
<v Speaker 6>And you can't blame them.</v>

5985
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:20.930
<v Speaker 6>They grew,</v>

5986
02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:24.620
<v Speaker 6>we imitate our atmosphere and we adapt to our environment.</v>

5987
02:36:24.621 --> 02:36:28.970
<v Speaker 6>And if we grow up in a place where no one knows what the fuck is going on,</v>

5988
02:36:28.971 --> 02:36:30.230
<v Speaker 6>it's easy to lie.</v>

5989
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:33.830
<v Speaker 6>You have your family's caught up in religious calls and the other half of your</v>

5990
02:36:33.831 --> 02:36:35.570
<v Speaker 6>family is fucking crazy.</v>

5991
02:36:35.571 --> 02:36:38.150
<v Speaker 6>And who knows how to live this life.</v>

5992
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.691
<v Speaker 6>Who knows,</v>

5993
02:36:38.691 --> 02:36:40.940
<v Speaker 6>who knows what they're the correct way to go about it.</v>

5994
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:43.760
<v Speaker 6>Not enough information is being exchanged back and forth,</v>

5995
02:36:43.970 --> 02:36:48.230
<v Speaker 6>which in the forties fifties sixties seventies 80s and nineties it's not until</v>

5996
02:36:48.231 --> 02:36:50.870
<v Speaker 6>the two thousands come along that people start like looking around and going,</v>

5997
02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:52.220
<v Speaker 6>what's happening here?</v>

5998
02:36:52.490 --> 02:36:54.320
<v Speaker 6>This is a brief moment in history,</v>

5999
02:36:54.321 --> 02:36:54.651
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6000
02:36:54.651 --> 02:36:55.150
<v Speaker 6>It's uh,</v>

6001
02:36:55.150 --> 02:37:00.150
<v Speaker 6>a couple of decades where at least we're trying to make sense of things.</v>

6002
02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:04.580
<v Speaker 6>There was no effort to try to make sense of things in the 60s and the 50s they</v>

6003
02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:05.810
<v Speaker 6>didn't have the resources,</v>

6004
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:07.220
<v Speaker 6>they didn't have the access.</v>

6005
02:37:07.370 --> 02:37:11.120
<v Speaker 6>Occasionally you got groups like the Communist Party would come along and all</v>

6006
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:12.241
<v Speaker 6>they would do,</v>

6007
02:37:12.241 --> 02:37:14.600
<v Speaker 6>they would propose an alternative way of life.</v>

6008
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:15.140
<v Speaker 6>And then a,</v>

6009
02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:17.590
<v Speaker 6>like Joseph McCarthy would come along and arrest anybody,</v>

6010
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:21.500
<v Speaker 6>went to meetings and then everybody abandoned all that shit at a fear.</v>

6011
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:23.490
<v Speaker 6>And then we move on to the,</v>

6012
02:37:23.491 --> 02:37:24.320
<v Speaker 6>the next stage.</v>

6013
02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:29.320
<v Speaker 6>And then the 60s someone came along with acid and the acid came along and all of</v>

6014
02:37:29.361 --> 02:37:30.470
<v Speaker 6>a sudden for the first time,</v>

6015
02:37:30.471 --> 02:37:33.020
<v Speaker 6>so people grew up with some bullshit buddy Holly,</v>

6016
02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:34.243
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6017
02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:39.620
<v Speaker 6>than done the nonsense music of the 1950s were indoctrinated into the world of</v>

6018
02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:42.710
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic drugs.</v>

6019
02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 6>And then that changed.</v>

6020
02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:46.160
<v Speaker 6>So that was the first wave of information.</v>

6021
02:37:46.161 --> 02:37:48.010
<v Speaker 6>The first wave of information wasn't the Internet.</v>

6022
02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:48.920
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't even books.</v>

6023
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:50.360
<v Speaker 6>It was psychedelics.</v>

6024
02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:51.021
<v Speaker 6>Psychedelics.</v>

6025
02:37:51.021 --> 02:37:51.854
<v Speaker 6>After books,</v>

6026
02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:57.020
<v Speaker 6>books laid a foundation and then in the late fifties early sixties Albert</v>

6027
02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:59.780
<v Speaker 6>Hoffman came along and boom,</v>

6028
02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:03.950
<v Speaker 6>and the universe gave the human beings a big kiss on the lips and then all of a</v>

6029
02:38:03.951 --> 02:38:04.251
<v Speaker 6>sudden,</v>

6030
02:38:04.251 --> 02:38:04.701
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

6031
02:38:04.701 --> 02:38:07.400
<v Speaker 6>we blossom with unique ideas and the Western world,</v>

6032
02:38:07.401 --> 02:38:12.401
<v Speaker 6>the height of intellectual debate and stimulation was introduced to the most</v>

6033
02:38:14.241 --> 02:38:16.400
<v Speaker 6>powerful psychedelic drugs known to man.</v>

6034
02:38:16.401 --> 02:38:19.010
<v Speaker 6>And it all branched out and flooded from there.</v>

6035
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:22.910
<v Speaker 6>And then from those came the very idea of the Internet.</v>

6036
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:27.860
<v Speaker 6>How many people that that did that created the Internet didn't smoke weed?</v>

6037
02:38:28.220 --> 02:38:30.050
<v Speaker 6>How many of them hadn't tried mushrooms?</v>

6038
02:38:30.051 --> 02:38:31.340
<v Speaker 6>How many of them never tried it?</v>

6039
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:32.330
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

6040
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:34.280
<v Speaker 6>the Internet without you might be able to.</v>

6041
02:38:34.310 --> 02:38:35.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

6042
02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:36.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how your brain works.</v>

6043
02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:37.221
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how you can,</v>

6044
02:38:37.221 --> 02:38:38.630
<v Speaker 6>do you know who you are?</v>

6045
02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:39.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

6046
02:38:39.130 --> 02:38:40.700
<v Speaker 6>I you don't know how to do who I am.</v>

6047
02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.350
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine if you had to be me for a day?</v>

6048
02:38:42.351 --> 02:38:44.630
<v Speaker 6>Whether or not you would do it without fucking it up.</v>

6049
02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:45.890
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't be you for a day.</v>

6050
02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.140
<v Speaker 6>If I came home and I tried to be you and your wife would be like,</v>

6051
02:38:48.141 --> 02:38:49.670
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is wrong with you Bert?</v>

6052
02:38:50.250 --> 02:38:51.760
<v Speaker 6>Is she checking for Robbie?</v>

6053
02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

6054
02:38:54.910 --> 02:38:55.150
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

6055
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.421
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6056
02:38:55.421 --> 02:38:56.450
<v Speaker 2>what we'll do,</v>

6057
02:38:58.120 --> 02:38:59.050
<v Speaker 2>we'll it Burt too.</v>

6058
02:39:01.810 --> 02:39:02.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy.</v>

6059
02:39:03.430 --> 02:39:04.181
<v Speaker 2>I could not be you.</v>

6060
02:39:04.181 --> 02:39:06.010
<v Speaker 2>You could be me in a heartbeat.</v>

6061
02:39:06.190 --> 02:39:06.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6062
02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:07.243
<v Speaker 2>he's saying that</v>

6063
02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:08.711
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

6064
02:39:08.711 --> 02:39:09.760
<v Speaker 2>You say that that's not true.</v>

6065
02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:11.670
<v Speaker 2>I could never be painting.</v>

6066
02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:13.540
<v Speaker 6>I can never be my sister.</v>

6067
02:39:13.541 --> 02:39:14.170
<v Speaker 6>I can never,</v>

6068
02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:18.070
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean that each individual unit is like,</v>

6069
02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:20.530
<v Speaker 6>it's more or less effective.</v>

6070
02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:23.380
<v Speaker 6>It's like I would be less effective at being Bert.</v>

6071
02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:25.150
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6072
02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:25.983
<v Speaker 6>Like</v>

6073
02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying,</v>

6074
02:39:27.170 --> 02:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>but like I definitely like if like if it was like freaky Friday and we</v>

02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:37.753
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

6078
02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:39.493
<v Speaker 2>I would be,</v>

6079
02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I would be the mom who got the child's body as opposed to the child.</v>

6080
02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Like in the Lindsay Lohan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jamie Curtis movie.</v>

6084
02:39:53.930 --> 02:39:57.220
<v Speaker 2>There was a movie with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Curtis who was like,</v>

6085
02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay Lohan learned a lot,</v>

6086

6089
02:40:10.791 --> 02:40:12.290

6100
02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:33.241

6101
02:40:33.241 --> 02:40:34.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6102
02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:34.741
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>

6103
02:40:34.741 --> 02:40:35.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6104
02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:37.560
<v Speaker 3>you know the rumors about her that she's a hermaphrodite.</v>

6105
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6106
02:40:37.831 --> 02:40:38.850
<v Speaker 3>What's that rumor about?</v>

6107
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:39.990
<v Speaker 3>A douchey rumor?</v>

6108
02:40:40.050 --> 02:40:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Sweet.</v>

6109
02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:41.131
<v Speaker 3>So I had,</v>

6110
02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I did a show for comedy central long time ago called buzz where we'd,</v>

6111
02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:45.960
<v Speaker 3>it was Ben Bailey show cash cab,</v>

6112
02:40:45.961 --> 02:40:46.794
<v Speaker 3>but with drunk people.</v>

6113
02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:50.250
<v Speaker 3>So pay people about three toms Grover was the head writer and I picked people</v>

6114
02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:54.450
<v Speaker 3>off the street and then we play a game show in the back of a van and a randomly,</v>

6115
02:40:54.451 --> 02:40:57.390
<v Speaker 3>last group we got was a bunch of like three dudes that were fucking hammered.</v>

6116
02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:00.690
<v Speaker 3>The mount you blew into the breathalyzer was your bank.</v>

6117
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:03.180
<v Speaker 3>So if you blew the dude who was the drunkest who was like,</v>

6118
02:41:03.181 --> 02:41:03.961
<v Speaker 3>you just add a zero.</v>

6119
02:41:03.961 --> 02:41:05.520
<v Speaker 3>So if you bought blue 0.36,</v>

6120
02:41:05.521 --> 02:41:09.510
<v Speaker 3>you got a $360 in the bank just for going home and being responsible.</v>

6121
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Then every game we played,</v>

6122
02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:11.601
<v Speaker 3>you could accrue money,</v>

6123
02:41:11.601 --> 02:41:15.390
<v Speaker 3>so could bounce with like 750 bucks for the group and we'll drop you off at home</v>

6124
02:41:15.391 --> 02:41:17.700
<v Speaker 3>and you just made money in [inaudible] stupid fucking show.</v>

6125
02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Are you involved in,</v>

6126
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.620
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of money.</v>

6127
02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:20.101
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

6128
02:41:20.101 --> 02:41:20.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6129
02:41:20.610 --> 02:41:21.443

02:41:59.701 --> 02:42:00.061
<v Speaker 3>stick it.</v>

6156
02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:00.894
<v Speaker 3>My Dad fucked her.</v>

02:42:03.001 --> 02:42:03.900
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd go,</v>

6167
02:42:09.721 --> 02:42:14.250

6168
02:42:14.251 --> 02:42:19.251
<v Speaker 3>offensive and ambiguous means don't pay me enough and not do it.</v>

6174
02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:33.000
<v Speaker 3>I was in not a Freudian slip,</v>

6175
02:42:33.001 --> 02:42:34.440

02:42:50.970 --> 02:42:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I was explaining a joke and I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was explaining to my daughter the tenements of comedy and someone goes,</v>

02:42:58.380 --> 02:42:58.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6191
02:42:58.561 --> 02:42:59.580
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes of word.</v>

6192
02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I Said said apartment building.</v>

6193
02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:02.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6194
02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:03.733
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

6195
02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I got a better one.</v>

6196
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

6197
02:43:05.850 --> 02:43:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

6198
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:11.630
<v Speaker 3>I took a movie pitch out for like fucking literally 10 before someone stopped me</v>

6199
02:43:12.861 --> 02:43:13.340
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

6200
02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I think you're using the term a salt of the earth wrong.</v>

6201
02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I thought salt of the earth was like,</v>

6202
02:43:19.070 --> 02:43:19.501
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

6203
02:43:19.501 --> 02:43:20.870
<v Speaker 3>that just hang around all the time.</v>

6204
02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:23.180
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

6205
02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:23.421
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

6206
02:43:23.421 --> 02:43:25.580
<v Speaker 3>this guy grew up with the salt of the earth.</v>

6207
02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:29.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the type of person that sold you the earth means like the really good</v>

6208
02:43:29.361 --> 02:43:29.751
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

6209
02:43:29.751 --> 02:43:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

6210
02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I just thought it meant people that hung out and were like,</v>

6211
02:43:31.731 --> 02:43:31.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6212
02:43:31.941 --> 02:43:34.220
<v Speaker 3>like you know the dudes that were always on the corner of the salt of the earth.</v>

6213
02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:34.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6214
02:43:34.611 --> 02:43:35.391
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

6215
02:43:35.391 --> 02:43:36.201
<v Speaker 3>Why did you think that?</v>

6216
02:43:36.201 --> 02:43:39.520
<v Speaker 3>You just like heard the expression and never investigated Joe?</v>

6217
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:41.270
<v Speaker 3>At one time I gave a speech,</v>

6218
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:43.310
<v Speaker 3>I thought the word,</v>

6219
02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I thought idiot savant was synonymous with autistic and I said to my boss,</v>

6220
02:43:49.430 --> 02:43:50.263
<v Speaker 3>I said to my,</v>

6221
02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:50.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6222
02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:52.190
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of folks it is,</v>

6223
02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:53.380
<v Speaker 3>but an ironman.</v>

6224
02:43:53.450 --> 02:43:57.500
<v Speaker 3>I thought what I was trying to say is my buddy is really good when it comes to</v>

6225
02:43:57.501 --> 02:44:00.770
<v Speaker 3>meeting people I met say like he's the idiot savant of meeting people.</v>

6226
02:44:00.770 --> 02:44:02.330
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to even be just does it,</v>

6227
02:44:02.510 --> 02:44:04.200
<v Speaker 3>but I see you said the autistic I go,</v>

6228
02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:05.120
<v Speaker 3>he is autistic.</v>

6229
02:44:05.121 --> 02:44:08.120
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to meeting with people and people were like,</v>

6230
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.640
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

6231
02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.130
<v Speaker 3>you're using that role and I was giving a speech in front of like 500 dudes,</v>

6232
02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:14.330
<v Speaker 3>artists,</v>

6233
02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:17.090
<v Speaker 3>autism and being autistic is very unfortunate.</v>

6234
02:44:17.091 --> 02:44:20.420
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the direct opposite of meeting people sometimes.</v>

6235
02:44:20.421 --> 02:44:21.254
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes,</v>

6236
02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:24.680
<v Speaker 3>but if someone is artistic and also a savant,</v>

6237
02:44:24.860 --> 02:44:25.430
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>

6238
02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:26.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6239
02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>he's emotionally troubled,</v>

6240
02:44:27.471 --> 02:44:29.630
<v Speaker 3>but look at the great blank.</v>

6241
02:44:29.631 --> 02:44:31.560
<v Speaker 3>He does idiots.</v>

6242
02:44:31.710 --> 02:44:32.391
<v Speaker 3>Silvana is,</v>

6243
02:44:32.391 --> 02:44:33.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if that's politically correct.</v>

6244
02:44:33.651 --> 02:44:34.221
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

6245
02:44:34.221 --> 02:44:34.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6246
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:35.990
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with an idiot some lot,</v>

6247
02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:36.561
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

6248
02:44:36.561 --> 02:44:37.420
<v Speaker 3>it's like when it comes to math,</v>

6249
02:44:37.530 --> 02:44:39.860
<v Speaker 3>it becomes naturally and they're so good at it.</v>

6250
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.940
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing.</v>

6251
02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6252
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:42.850
<v Speaker 3>So I was trying to say it.</v>

6253
02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:43.221
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6254
02:44:43.221 --> 02:44:43.401
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6255
02:44:43.401 --> 02:44:43.581
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6256
02:44:43.581 --> 02:44:43.761
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6257
02:44:43.761 --> 02:44:43.971
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6258
02:44:43.971 --> 02:44:44.360
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

6259
02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:45.230
<v Speaker 6>It's not just that.</v>

6260
02:44:45.260 --> 02:44:47.600
<v Speaker 6>It's the idea that they're not good at anything else.</v>

6261
02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:50.780
<v Speaker 6>It's like you take a guy that could barely communicate with you,</v>

6262
02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:53.360
<v Speaker 6>but then you put them on a piano when he makes amazing music.</v>

6263
02:44:53.390 --> 02:44:54.500
<v Speaker 6>That's an idiot savant.</v>

6264
02:44:54.740 --> 02:44:55.130
<v Speaker 6>So it,</v>

6265
02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.700
<v Speaker 6>it's to bond.</v>

6266
02:44:55.700 --> 02:44:56.860
<v Speaker 6>This guy's a terrible way to,</v>

6267
02:44:56.890 --> 02:45:01.890
<v Speaker 6>to express it because it's clearly someone who has a troubled brain function or</v>

6268
02:45:03.351 --> 02:45:05.270
<v Speaker 6>a troubled mental function,</v>

6269
02:45:05.271 --> 02:45:05.660
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

6270
02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:06.830
<v Speaker 6>however you want to describe it.</v>

6271
02:45:07.340 --> 02:45:09.290
<v Speaker 6>And they also have,</v>

6272
02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:09.680
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

6273
02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:11.090
<v Speaker 6>a lot of energy floating around.</v>

6274
02:45:11.091 --> 02:45:12.530
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes if they can focus it,</v>

6275
02:45:12.531 --> 02:45:16.430
<v Speaker 6>whether it's on art or whether it's on music or whether it's on whatever it is,</v>

6276
02:45:16.700 --> 02:45:17.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6277
02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:17.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6278
02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:18.500
<v Speaker 6>it could be video games,</v>

6279
02:45:18.501 --> 02:45:19.850
<v Speaker 6>it could be a game,</v>

6280
02:45:19.851 --> 02:45:21.980
<v Speaker 6>it could be something that intrigues them,</v>

6281
02:45:21.981 --> 02:45:22.200
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

6282
02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:22.950
<v Speaker 3>math,</v>

6283
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:23.521
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

6284
02:45:23.521 --> 02:45:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

6285
02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:24.391
<v Speaker 3>Math,</v>

6286
02:45:24.391 --> 02:45:24.850
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

6287
02:45:24.850 --> 02:45:25.683
<v Speaker 3>dancing.</v>

6288
02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:26.730
<v Speaker 3>And when that happens,</v>

6289
02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.150
<v Speaker 3>then they find an outlet for that intense focus.</v>

6290
02:45:30.151 --> 02:45:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Because they're there,</v>

6291
02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:32.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6292
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:36.560
<v Speaker 6>Because the fact that they're limited in various social arenas,</v>

6293
02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:40.100
<v Speaker 6>limited in their understanding of human communication,</v>

6294
02:45:40.101 --> 02:45:42.290
<v Speaker 6>they might not put any resources to that at all.</v>

6295
02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:42.770
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

6296
02:45:42.770 --> 02:45:46.790
<v Speaker 6>one of the awkward aspects of who they are might be that they don't put any</v>

6297
02:45:46.850 --> 02:45:47.750
<v Speaker 6>resources to that.</v>

6298
02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:49.160
<v Speaker 6>They just have blocked that out.</v>

6299
02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:54.490
<v Speaker 6>So instead they can concentrate almost entirely on trying something or making a</v>

6300
02:45:54.531 --> 02:45:54.860
<v Speaker 6>mute.</v>

6301
02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:55.451
<v Speaker 6>A song.</v>

6302
02:45:55.451 --> 02:45:55.680
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

6303
02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:55.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6304
02:45:55.861 --> 02:45:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Well I would have used it wrong if I said it that way too.</v>

6305
02:45:58.080 --> 02:45:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I meant to say it was really good at it.</v>

6306
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.840
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

6307
02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I chose idiot savant.</v>

6308
02:46:02.500 --> 02:46:02.750
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6309
02:46:02.750 --> 02:46:05.320
<v Speaker 6>no there's nothing wrong with saying idiot savant.</v>

6310
02:46:05.350 --> 02:46:07.060
<v Speaker 6>Even as a goof on your friends.</v>

6311
02:46:07.061 --> 02:46:07.870
<v Speaker 6>Cause saying like,</v>

6312
02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:10.130
<v Speaker 6>cause we all know that guy that's not good</v>

6313
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:10.970
<v Speaker 3>at one thing,</v>

6314
02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:11.750
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

6315
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:12.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6316
02:46:12.271 --> 02:46:14.060
<v Speaker 3>or he's not good at a lot of things.</v>

6317
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:16.370
<v Speaker 3>But this is one thing and he's fucking awesome APP.</v>

6318
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6319
02:46:16.930 --> 02:46:21.110
<v Speaker 3>whether he's an awesome mechanic or he's an awesome musician or an awesome</v>

6320
02:46:21.111 --> 02:46:21.860
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>

6321
02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:24.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many comedians that we know that are absolutely hilarious.</v>

6322
02:46:24.381 --> 02:46:27.050
<v Speaker 3>But if Joey Diaz had a function in the real world,</v>

6323
02:46:27.170 --> 02:46:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell me Julie Diaz is not an idiot savant for standup comedy and not,</v>

6324
02:46:30.441 --> 02:46:32.210
<v Speaker 3>and that by saying he's an idiot savant.</v>

6325
02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I would never say he's an idiot because he's a brilliant person.</v>

6326
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:36.770
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to recognize what's funny about something.</v>

6327
02:46:36.771 --> 02:46:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6328
02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:41.930
<v Speaker 3>he's got a true genius perspective when it comes to that,</v>

6329
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:44.260
<v Speaker 3>but if we give,</v>

6330
02:46:44.270 --> 02:46:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Joey had to work in a factory next to you,</v>

6331
02:46:46.251 --> 02:46:49.670
<v Speaker 3>you'd be hating your life except for the fact that the stories would be awesome.</v>

6332
02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>

6333
02:46:50.370 --> 02:46:51.201
<v Speaker 3>Work next to him.</v>

6334
02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:51.760
<v Speaker 3>He'd probably love it.</v>

6335
02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Although you were picking up his job,</v>

6336
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:57.260
<v Speaker 3>the company would only love it if they could enjoy his personality,</v>

6337
02:46:57.261 --> 02:46:59.360
<v Speaker 3>but if the company had to rely on its productivity,</v>

6338
02:46:59.361 --> 02:47:00.230
<v Speaker 3>they'd be fucked.</v>

6339
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:02.510
<v Speaker 3>The Real Kenny powers,</v>

6340
02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:04.400
<v Speaker 3>he's better than that.</v>

6341
02:47:04.401 --> 02:47:04.941
<v Speaker 3>Better than that,</v>

6342
02:47:04.941 --> 02:47:05.391
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

6343
02:47:05.391 --> 02:47:05.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

6344
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:06.583
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6345
02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:07.460
<v Speaker 3>that's a character.</v>

6346
02:47:07.490 --> 02:47:08.660
<v Speaker 3>He's the real deal.</v>

6347
02:47:08.770 --> 02:47:12.290
<v Speaker 3>He's just doesn't fuck around a kind of version of that.</v>

6348
02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6349
02:47:12.690 --> 02:47:14.870
<v Speaker 3>That side sort of a hyper,</v>

6350
02:47:14.871 --> 02:47:15.230
<v Speaker 3>c'mon,</v>

02:47:17.151 --> 02:47:20.690
<v Speaker 3>the guy who comes up with his own way of handling the situation that she ever,</v>

6354
02:47:20.691 --> 02:47:22.910
<v Speaker 3>do you ever watch Sean rouse do standup comedy show?</v>

6355
02:47:22.911 --> 02:47:23.600
<v Speaker 3>I Love Shaun.</v>

6356
02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:24.171

6357
02:47:24.171 --> 02:47:24.560
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

6358
02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:26.240
<v Speaker 3>He's got a lot of physical problems.</v>

6359
02:47:26.241 --> 02:47:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

6360
02:47:26.690 --> 02:47:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6361
02:47:26.990 --> 02:47:27.823
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of,</v>

6362
02:47:27.890 --> 02:47:29.840
<v Speaker 3>he's got real bad arthritis.</v>

6363
02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:30.291
<v Speaker 3>I man,</v>

6364
02:47:30.291 --> 02:47:32.450
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking talented.</v>

6365
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6366
02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:35.460
<v Speaker 3>So fucking talented and he's a beautiful,</v>

6367
02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking idiot savant.</v>

6368
02:47:37.101 --> 02:47:37.934
<v Speaker 3>Like he's almost like,</v>

6369
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:39.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like that person now.</v>

6370
02:47:39.051 --> 02:47:40.170
<v Speaker 3>He's actually a good comic.</v>

6371
02:47:40.171 --> 02:47:40.761
<v Speaker 3>You Fuck No.</v>

6372
02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:41.740
<v Speaker 3>But his personality,</v>

6373
02:47:41.810 --> 02:47:43.460
<v Speaker 3>so like if you put him in a workplace,</v>

6374
02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:44.533
<v Speaker 3>there's no like,</v>

6375
02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:47.900
<v Speaker 3>like there's no dialing that back maybe,</v>

6376
02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:48.261
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

6377
02:47:48.261 --> 02:47:48.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6378
02:47:48.621 --> 02:47:49.101
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6379
02:47:49.101 --> 02:47:51.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what kind of jobs he's had his hand up.</v>

6380
02:47:51.980 --> 02:47:52.600
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6381
02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:54.740
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to do anything but stand up a bunch of,</v>

6382
02:47:54.741 --> 02:47:56.870
<v Speaker 3>you're good at stand up because everything else,</v>

6383
02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:58.850
<v Speaker 3>it seems so boring.</v>

6384
02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:01.790
<v Speaker 3>You ever play that game?</v>

6385
02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you had another job.</v>

6386
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I have other jobs,</v>

6387
02:48:03.861 --> 02:48:08.780
<v Speaker 3>so I try to keep other jobs like UFC and podcasts.</v>

6388
02:48:08.830 --> 02:48:11.050
<v Speaker 3>That's saying no,</v>

6389
02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:11.691
<v Speaker 3>not a job.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Job.</v>

6392
02:48:16.130 --> 02:48:16.963
<v Speaker 3>That's work.</v>

6393
02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:17.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6394
02:48:17.661 --> 02:48:18.560
<v Speaker 3>That is not fun.</v>

6395
02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:20.180
<v Speaker 3>Who's like I said,</v>

6396
02:48:20.181 --> 02:48:25.181
<v Speaker 3>10 o'clock it's 10 oh five work at ups checking boxes in the back of a truck.</v>

6397
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6398
02:48:25.870 --> 02:48:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I see those dudes that listen to these podcasts and the color and they're like,</v>

6399
02:48:28.371 --> 02:48:28.671

<v Speaker 3>you guys doing that podcast makes my life so fucking doable.</v>

6401
02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:33.133
<v Speaker 3>And you think to yourself,</v>

6402
02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:37.940
<v Speaker 3>what a fucking service you get to delivered to like a guy just like yourself.</v>

6403
02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:38.901
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

6404
02:48:38.901 --> 02:48:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Shelf.</v>

6405
02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:39.920
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

6406
02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:40.251
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

6407
02:48:40.251 --> 02:48:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I can say just like me because I just got lucky and really stone wrote an</v>

6408
02:48:43.551 --> 02:48:44.384
<v Speaker 3>article about me.</v>

6409
02:48:44.510 --> 02:48:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6410
02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:45.470
<v Speaker 3>So like I,</v>

6411
02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:45.681
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6412
02:48:45.681 --> 02:48:46.730
<v Speaker 3>but that's all bullshit.</v>

6413
02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:47.290
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6414
02:48:47.290 --> 02:48:50.840
<v Speaker 3>But it was a doorway that opened up that allowed you to be bird.</v>

6415
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:52.123
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6416
02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:54.320
<v Speaker 3>we all got lucky at one point in time.</v>

6417
02:48:54.321 --> 02:48:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky that a friend talked me into going on stage at an open mic night in</v>

6418
02:48:57.561 --> 02:49:01.070
<v Speaker 3>1988 and we were all got lucky in one way or another.</v>

6419
02:49:01.071 --> 02:49:02.330
<v Speaker 3>But from there on,</v>

6420
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:03.770
<v Speaker 3>it's really just about,</v>

6421
02:49:03.890 --> 02:49:06.860
<v Speaker 3>and this is a really important thing for other people to realize.</v>

6422
02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Like people,</v>

6423
02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6424
02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6425
02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:10.650
<v Speaker 6>we've had this discussion on the podcast before and people like,</v>

6426
02:49:10.651 --> 02:49:10.831
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

6427
02:49:10.831 --> 02:49:11.850
<v Speaker 6>you're just counting luck.</v>

6428
02:49:12.390 --> 02:49:13.410
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely not.</v>

6429
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:18.150
<v Speaker 6>There's unquestionably the fact that you're even alive is incredibly fortunate.</v>

6430
02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:20.130
<v Speaker 6>If you look at children that have progeria,</v>

6431
02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:23.130
<v Speaker 6>if you look at people that are born in terrible places in the world,</v>

6432
02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:25.260
<v Speaker 6>just the fact that you're in America,</v>

6433
02:49:25.261 --> 02:49:29.280
<v Speaker 6>you have to concede to a certain amount of luck in this life.</v>

6434
02:49:29.310 --> 02:49:30.510
<v Speaker 6>There's no doubt about it.</v>

6435
02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:32.250
<v Speaker 6>But I'm from then on,</v>

6436
02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.520
<v Speaker 6>what allowed you to move forward and what allowed you to advance yourself to a</v>

6437
02:49:39.271 --> 02:49:42.960
<v Speaker 6>position where you're really comfortable creating comedy on stage?</v>

6438
02:49:43.410 --> 02:49:44.610
<v Speaker 6>It's not a lot of luck.</v>

6439
02:49:44.970 --> 02:49:47.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's sometimes locked pops up,</v>

6440
02:49:47.131 --> 02:49:48.300
<v Speaker 6>but you know when it comes,</v>

6441
02:49:48.570 --> 02:49:50.100
<v Speaker 6>when you actually have done work,</v>

6442
02:49:50.410 --> 02:49:52.260
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to be a comedian,</v>

6443
02:49:52.290 --> 02:49:53.520
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to be a performer,</v>

6444
02:49:53.521 --> 02:49:54.840
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to be someone who people,</v>

6445
02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:58.680
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be some amount of talent and work that's involved there.</v>

6446
02:49:58.680 --> 02:49:59.760
<v Speaker 6>It can't just be luck.</v>

6447
02:50:00.330 --> 02:50:05.330
<v Speaker 6>And so to concentrate on the luck of others is a very negative way of focusing</v>

6448
02:50:06.391 --> 02:50:07.224
<v Speaker 6>on things.</v>

6449
02:50:07.350 --> 02:50:10.710
<v Speaker 6>And it doesn't inspire you because it seems so random and unfair.</v>

6450
02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:14.520
<v Speaker 6>You know when you look at a guy who named the Guy Blank,</v>

6451
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:18.330
<v Speaker 6>this guy all of a sudden has got you selling out arenas and he sells a million</v>

6452
02:50:18.331 --> 02:50:19.890
<v Speaker 6>CD's and why him?</v>

6453
02:50:19.891 --> 02:50:22.740
<v Speaker 6>And he got lucky and if it wasn't for this,</v>

6454
02:50:22.741 --> 02:50:23.670
<v Speaker 6>this lucky fuck,</v>

6455
02:50:23.671 --> 02:50:27.630
<v Speaker 6>and you're doing a disservice to yourself by focusing on that,</v>

6456
02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:29.760
<v Speaker 6>there's that shouldn't even exist to you.</v>

6457
02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:31.410
<v Speaker 6>Well you should do is say,</v>

6458
02:50:31.411 --> 02:50:32.100
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

6459
02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:33.630
<v Speaker 6>look at what's possible.</v>

6460
02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:35.520
<v Speaker 6>Look at what's possible.</v>

6461
02:50:35.521 --> 02:50:36.354
<v Speaker 6>If you're this guy,</v>

6462
02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:37.500
<v Speaker 6>look at what's possible.</v>

6463
02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:41.850
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible and it should make you instead of like shitting on this guy</v>

6464
02:50:41.851 --> 02:50:42.450
<v Speaker 6>instead of like,</v>

6465
02:50:42.450 --> 02:50:45.200
<v Speaker 6>oh Kevin Hart or all the fucking knew</v>

6466
02:50:45.570 --> 02:50:46.403
<v Speaker 2>Ken Young,</v>

6467
02:50:47.270 --> 02:50:49.980
<v Speaker 2>someone who can cook like that.</v>

6468
02:50:49.981 --> 02:50:50.280
<v Speaker 2>You would,</v>

6469
02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:51.570
<v Speaker 2>that you would let people go.</v>

6470
02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:52.091
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6471
02:50:52.091 --> 02:50:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's hilarious.</v>

6472
02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:53.933
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>

6473
02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:55.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

6474
02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:56.213
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean Ken.</v>

6475
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.761
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>

6476
02:50:56.761 --> 02:50:58.110
<v Speaker 2>don't hear that and think I said that,</v>

6477
02:50:58.290 --> 02:50:58.721
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

6478
02:50:58.721 --> 02:51:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but I know what you're saying when you go like he was just a harder,</v>

6479
02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:03.460
<v Speaker 2>better example really.</v>

6480
02:51:03.730 --> 02:51:05.340
<v Speaker 2>I think Kevin's fucking so talented,</v>

6481
02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:07.120
<v Speaker 2>talented people.</v>

6482
02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:09.350
<v Speaker 6>But people will question there.</v>

6483
02:51:09.370 --> 02:51:09.611
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

6484
02:51:09.611 --> 02:51:10.640
<v Speaker 6>it's got to be lucky.</v>

6485
02:51:10.641 --> 02:51:11.060
<v Speaker 6>I've heard,</v>

6486
02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:14.030
<v Speaker 6>I've heard it so many times and you get lucky.</v>

6487
02:51:14.031 --> 02:51:15.140
<v Speaker 6>It's not possible.</v>

6488
02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:18.320
<v Speaker 6>So you just say it because it didn't happen to them and they think that this guy</v>

6489
02:51:18.321 --> 02:51:20.630
<v Speaker 6>got picked somehow that he figured his way through.</v>

6490
02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:24.470
<v Speaker 6>People find a way to justify their continence.</v>

6491
02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6492
02:51:25.230 --> 02:51:25.681
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>

6493
02:51:25.681 --> 02:51:26.400
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

6494
02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think Kevin Young,</v>

6495
02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart,</v>

6496
02:51:29.610 --> 02:51:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have forever.</v>

6497
02:51:31.141 --> 02:51:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I think he's super talented and,</v>

6498
02:51:33.071 --> 02:51:33.990
<v Speaker 2>and even Ken Young,</v>

6499
02:51:33.991 --> 02:51:34.290
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

6500
02:51:34.290 --> 02:51:35.880
<v Speaker 2>but the only argument I would give with,</v>

6501
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.871
<v Speaker 2>with like Ken was at,</v>

6502
02:51:36.871 --> 02:51:40.560
<v Speaker 2>he's a movie star and he got into a movie that happened to blow the fuck up.</v>

6503
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Like people could argue Zach's very lucky.</v>

6504
02:51:42.451 --> 02:51:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I think Zach's very talented,</v>

6505
02:51:43.890 --> 02:51:44.723
<v Speaker 2>just like Ken.</v>

6506
02:51:45.150 --> 02:51:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Like they just happened to gotten to be into the biggest movie of this</v>

6507
02:51:49.321 --> 02:51:50.154
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

6508
02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6509
02:51:51.810 --> 02:51:54.010
<v Speaker 2>The hangovers dub good.</v>

6510
02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

6511
02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:56.760
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying that's how people could argue.</v>

6512
02:51:56.780 --> 02:51:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Luck.</v>

6513
02:51:57.200 --> 02:51:57.470
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

6514
02:51:57.470 --> 02:52:00.710
<v Speaker 6>all know the god that wasn't that good sort of snuck into things.</v>

6515
02:52:00.711 --> 02:52:04.190
<v Speaker 6>And then after awhile people figuring them out or they get better.</v>

6516
02:52:04.191 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 6>I mean those are the only that are available.</v>

6517
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 6>Either they get better or people figure him out and they they,</v>

6518
02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:09.850
<v Speaker 6>they fade away.</v>

6519
02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:10.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6520
02:52:10.390 --> 02:52:13.090
<v Speaker 6>but that's just this weird ass fucking stupid business.</v>

6521
02:52:13.460 --> 02:52:14.980
<v Speaker 6>It's business is super unhealthy.</v>

6522
02:52:15.370 --> 02:52:15.910
<v Speaker 6>I say that.</v>

6523
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:19.270
<v Speaker 6>I would say so that La is like a methadone clinic for attention whores.</v>

6524
02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:21.010
<v Speaker 6>Like you never really get cured.</v>

6525
02:52:21.011 --> 02:52:22.480
<v Speaker 6>You just get hooked on some new shit.</v>

6526
02:52:22.930 --> 02:52:26.860
<v Speaker 6>You just get hooked on some acting shit or some popularity shit.</v>

6527
02:52:26.890 --> 02:52:27.730
<v Speaker 6>We're having kids.</v>

6528
02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:28.821
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6529
02:52:28.821 --> 02:52:29.220
<v Speaker 6>Some people,</v>

6530
02:52:29.220 --> 02:52:29.371
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6531
02:52:29.371 --> 02:52:30.040
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

6532
02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I saw it.</v>

6533
02:52:30.430 --> 02:52:31.260
<v Speaker 3>It definitely does it.</v>

6534
02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:32.001
<v Speaker 3>We had to do like,</v>

6535
02:52:32.001 --> 02:52:32.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6536
02:52:32.550 --> 02:52:33.720
<v Speaker 3>an hour long.</v>

6537
02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:35.033
<v Speaker 3>Are we getting close?</v>

6538
02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:35.471
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6539
02:52:35.471 --> 02:52:35.701
<v Speaker 6>we're on,</v>

6540
02:52:35.701 --> 02:52:36.491
<v Speaker 6>but five minutes away.</v>

6541
02:52:36.491 --> 02:52:39.880
<v Speaker 6>Do we turn into a pumpkin fuck three hour podcasts.</v>

6542
02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:40.630
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

6543
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:42.190
<v Speaker 6>let's wrap this rock this.</v>

6544
02:52:42.650 --> 02:52:44.500
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of comfortable now that Brian's not here.</v>

6545
02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:46.630
<v Speaker 6>It's unfortunate for him.</v>

6546
02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Brian's listening,</v>

6547
02:52:52.390 --> 02:52:53.211
<v Speaker 3>listening to shit.</v>

6548
02:52:53.211 --> 02:52:54.560
<v Speaker 3>That lazy bitch will never hear this.</v>

6549
02:52:54.561 --> 02:52:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Let somebody tweets it to him.</v>

6550
02:52:55.730 --> 02:52:56.990
<v Speaker 3>He texted me and he goes,</v>

6551
02:52:56.991 --> 02:52:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you can download opie and Anthony.</v>

6552
02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:00.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6553
02:53:00.021 --> 02:53:02.810
<v Speaker 3>You were talking nonsense about audible.com one of our sponsors.</v>

6554
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.501
<v Speaker 3>Are they really?</v>

6555
02:53:03.501 --> 02:53:04.370
