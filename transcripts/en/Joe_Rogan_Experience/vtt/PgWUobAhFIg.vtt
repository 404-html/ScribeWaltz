00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable for short bursts,</v>

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.950
<v Speaker 1>don't eat so much</v>

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything you just said,</v>

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a really interesting study</v>

5
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 2>that just came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks ago where they looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the rates of aging in young adults.</v>

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 2>So they looked at different time points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they look at,</v>

8
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 2>they took the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole,</v>

9
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like over a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and the study started when they</v>

10
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:30.761
<v Speaker 2>were like 26 years old and they measured</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 18 different biomarkers of aging.</v>

11
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 2>So they looked at like DNA health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They looked at telomere length.</v>

12
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 2>So tila mirrors are those caps on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of your chromosomes that protected</v>

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are markers for aging.</v>

14
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 2>They looked at hdl cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at c reactive protein,</v>

15
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>which is a inflammatory mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They looked at 18 different things and</v>

16
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:52.910
<v Speaker 2>they looked at these people that were 26</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old and then it did it again when</v>

17
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 2>they were 32.</v>

18
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 2>And then they did it again when there</v>
<v Speaker 2>were 38.</v>

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 2>And what they found was that even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people were all the same</v>

20
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>chronological age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their cells looked very,</v>

21
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.030
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different people age at different</v>

22
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 2>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

23
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 2>if you looked on the cellular level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look 10 years older and some people</v>

24
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 2>look 10 years younger than their</v>
<v Speaker 2>chronological age.</v>

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And I was looking at some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>graphs of people and you can see some</v>

26
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 2>people started out like they started out</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad where they looked old and then they</v>

27
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 2>started getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

28
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 2>they probably started changing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

29
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>their lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other people started going worse.</v>

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Some people stayed the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

31
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very variables going on here.</v>

32
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

33
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their physical appearance also</v>

34
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>correlated with not their chronological</v>
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>

35
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 2>but their biological age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

36
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.183
<v Speaker 2>what it's called.</v>

37
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 2>So if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they showed their picture to people,</v>

38
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 2>random people and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what age they are,</v>

39
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 2>they would guess their biological age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not their chronological age.</v>

40
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So if a person was 38 but they look 28,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person would say,</v>

41
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably 28 and if the person</v>

42
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 2>was 38 but they looked 48,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just looked worn and you know,</v>

43
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the person would guess that they</v>

44
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 2>were much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much older than they were.</v>

45
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>So there was a correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical appearance and the biological</v>

46
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is.</v>

47
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I found this really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting because I think it is</v>

48
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 2>strong evidence for the fact that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet and your lifestyle play a major</v>

49
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>role in the way you age.</v>

50
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

51
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>if I was in the movie world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call somebody,</v>

52
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>but Melissa Mccarthy will be the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

53
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:29.501
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's the funniest woman around a.</v>

54
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>she's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very physically funny for sure.</v>

55
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>She's a very talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because Billy Gardell is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny comic.</v>

57
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You know billy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like on the show.</v>

59
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a straight guy.</v>

60
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course wouldn't want the husband get</v>
<v Speaker 1>one over on the wife.</v>

61
00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>What'd you joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't allow that.</v>

62
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

63
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>What's on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up with that fuck has jerk offs</v>

64
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>run Hollywood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

65
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It is what people want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people want to see that.</v>

66
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

67
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Holly has been hijacked by fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist.</v>

68
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong?</v>

69
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>If you guys can't relate that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking leaving.</v>

70
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever noticed a pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emasculation and movies and in fact the</v>

71
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's people that are</v>

72
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>seriously concerned with coming off as</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive and even if they think</v>

73
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>differently than what would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive choice,</v>

74
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>they will make the progressive choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get like social brownie</v>

75
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:20.501
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

76
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>definitely think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that pertains to</v>

77
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>

78
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not as funny if the dude gets over</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the CIC for someone to come on.</v>

79
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have told you this on the last</v>

80
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>time I was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a deal with a,</v>

81
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>this was years ago at Dennis Larry's</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

82
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And we come out here and take a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings and I felt like they had a</v>

83
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>sitcom idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at first of all,</v>

84
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>every meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75 percent of the room was female</v>

85
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.644
<v Speaker 1>executives.</v>

86
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And of course the first question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every meeting was,</v>

87
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>what's the wife's role?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking one.</v>

88
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>So by the time we got to NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the last one and I had fucking</v>

89
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

90
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>so what's the wedge I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again I was just kidding.</v>

91
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.700
<v Speaker 1>But I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see like in the pilot she's pregnant</v>

93
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:09.751
<v Speaker 1>and I push it down in the cellar stairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm expecting like Dennis to start</v>

94
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:11.580
<v Speaker 1>laughing and in Serpico Jimmy Syrup</v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

95
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And they all just look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have fucking her and append.</v>

96
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day,</v>

97
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to send a dozen roses to the lady</v>

98
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>from NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wonder why I can't get a Gig.</v>

99
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Thank God you throw me a news radio and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few grace under fire.</v>
