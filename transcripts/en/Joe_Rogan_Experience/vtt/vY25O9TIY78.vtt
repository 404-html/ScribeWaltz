<v Speaker 1>What were you saying about hereditary?</v>

8
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>That's supposed to be a terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

9
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they said.</v>

10
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning the media and a like Huffington </v>

11
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so that's why I went because I.</v>

12
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared by anything like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

13
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>so I'm constantly in pursuit of a actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary movie.</v>

14
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>So I went thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

15
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>this might be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not.</v>

16
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're that hard.</v>

17
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That no movies get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the last time I was </v>

18
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think poltergeist when I was a kid</v>

19
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I'm scared of clowns as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult though.</v>

20
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of the last time I </v>

21
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>was really scared and well see?</v>

22
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see they don't make well they're fun.</v>

23
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>

24
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I like and I also like a thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something might get me.</v>

25
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I like the suspense in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never does.</v>

26
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I always get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very anticlimactic for me.</v>

27
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>You like thinking that something might </v>
<v Speaker 1>get you scared and it doesn't.</v>

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not.</v>

29
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when was the last time you were scared </v>

30
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>and the movie said jump scares or that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cheap,</v>

31
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>cheap scares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>

32
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because to make it out loud,</v>

33
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't count.</v>

34
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't go see scary movies at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

35
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're always at home,</v>

36
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strangers.</v>

38
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.400
<v Speaker 1>That one bothered me a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in the weather.</v>

39
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just holding on that list is </v>

40
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>something to come in.</v>

41
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I was just sending out my instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

42
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>instagram stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

43
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>No the strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that one?</v>

44
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one was with Liv.</v>

45
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Tyler Stevens tasks on there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the trying to kill people.</v>

46
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one rocked me.</v>

47
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little.</v>

48
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>A little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Something about the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

50
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>You ever mind fuck yourself and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that there's like someone </v>

51
00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you think you hear something,</v>

52
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you open your door and you listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that actually has happened to me.</v>

53
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I had a peeping Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

54
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I had a real guy outside of my window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't see him.</v>

55
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I only heard him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

56
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>my window was cracked and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started whispering to me through my </v>

57
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk,</v>

58
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I have a joke about it now because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was only way I could deal with it </v>

59
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>without getting too paranoid about it.</v>

60
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a joke about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did,</v>

61
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every time I tell people they're </v>

62
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying.</v>

63
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>that is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it's like,</v>

65
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 1>was kind of flattering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of flattering out of his way to </v>

66
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 1>whisper all the windows he could gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

67
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>He came to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

69
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll see what the guy looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't but my neighbors.</v>

70
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So he came one night and I heard him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started whispering to me.</v>

71
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>

72
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying.</v>

73
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I was watching also let me give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>setup.</v>

74
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Mulholland drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen,</v>

75
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>are you a David Lynch Lynch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I had on,</v>

76
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a David Lynch fan and I had that.</v>

77
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I was probably like 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and uh,</v>

78
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I sleep with my window open because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>place is not have ac,</v>

79
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but I know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

80
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.590
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

81
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you live in Montana?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

82
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just drove in for this today.</v>

83
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>How can I live in la?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived at my place is old and I think </v>

84
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it was built before ace was even</v>

85
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.181
<v Speaker 1>invented so the windows are even old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school so I can't even put like a </v>

86
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>portable fake crank open and the windows</v>
<v Speaker 1>crank open like that.</v>

87
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.831
<v Speaker 1>So you can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to probably like get the </v>

88
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.111
<v Speaker 1>manager to replace the window </v>
<v Speaker 1>installments before I could even put an </v>

89
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:31.320
<v Speaker 1>air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you survived this.</v>

90
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just leave during the day and then at </v>

91
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.590
<v Speaker 1>night I have fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that just blow hot?</v>

92
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's awful.</v>

93
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Or I just spend the night at a friend's </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

94
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the move.</v>

95
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be here now.</v>

96
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.590

<v Speaker 2>so Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice and perfect.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This room does.</v>

99

<v Speaker 2>I hate you.</v>

100
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.850
<v Speaker 2>So we're friends trying to make me feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

101
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't feel bad for your accomplishments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

102
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Random Pink Himalayan salt rocks.</v>

108
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a stuff werewolf outside in a </v>

109
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

110
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's stuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

111
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like a real thing and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill it.</v>

112
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 2>That is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

113
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter if it was just a polar bear.</v>

114
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Scary than that.</v>

115
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>If anybody were to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actual werewolf,</v>

119
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.690

<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably like July of </v>

120
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>this was I think like two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

121
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.510
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't awful.</v>

122
00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like it is like now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of new.</v>

123
00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think La has ever been this hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>in like the beginning of July,</v>

124
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 1>so that's the end of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

125
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:57.251
<v Speaker 1>so anyway I was in my bed watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>mulholland drive and I had been like in </v>

126
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:01.031
<v Speaker 1>and out of like falling asleep and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I heard like a outside </v>

127
00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:06.341
<v Speaker 1>of my window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought at first I thought it was </v>

128
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:07.490
<v Speaker 1>this movie because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Lynch is a weird dude.</v>

129
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like a director's choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to creep people out to put like </v>

130
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.890
<v Speaker 1>murmuring in the background I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that at first.</v>

131
00:05:15.891 --> 00:05:20.891
<v Speaker 1>So I ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like probably 20 minutes later </v>

132
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:20.891
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's telling.</v>

133
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:21.770
<v Speaker 1>My Gut was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the movie.</v>

134
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 1>So I hit mute and all of a sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

135
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.260
<v Speaker 1>come on baby from that sweet pussy.</v>

136
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 1>So you're on the first floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the first floor.</v>

137
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 1>My duplex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

138
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:39.941
<v Speaker 1>anyone that's on the first floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your upstairs neighbors are problematic </v>

140
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 1>because it sounds like they were a horse</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes and they're bowling all the time.</v>

141
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.270
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole.</v>

142
00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no the whole thing,</v>

143
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>living on the first floor is not a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

144
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 1>but we have bars unlike most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows,</v>

145
00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:55.451
<v Speaker 1>so that's not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't scared he was going to </v>

146
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:58.151
<v Speaker 1>come in because the windows open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's bars in front of it so </v>

147
00:05:58.151 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't terrified that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.320
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was funny was that uh,</v>

149
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Ian Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:08.351
<v Speaker 1>Ian Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny comic working with them </v>

151
00:06:08.351 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have at the store?</v>

152
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>No Ice House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ice House.</v>

153
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

155
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>he was staying with me at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had just sold his place and </v>

156
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>receding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't far from here.</v>

157
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And then he was in our extra room at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

158
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>

159
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I think there's somebody outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you like,</v>

160
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>do you want to get indigo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who that was all I had.</v>

161
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.830
<v Speaker 3>What do you say it about Ian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think he can protect me?</v>

162
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.270
<v Speaker 3>He's Jamaican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy.</v>

163
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I love Ian Hart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not the one that called.</v>

164
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Weighs 18 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weighs less than me.</v>

165
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm careful when I hug him a hug.</v>

166
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I hug you more firmly than I hug you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get him to eat meat.</v>

167
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.550
<v Speaker 3>He told me he'll eat all my elk meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

168
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 3>he said he will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

169
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.920
<v Speaker 3>he just won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he will.</v>

170
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

171
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.820
<v Speaker 3>He's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

172
00:06:57.821 --> 00:06:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just doing that to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

173
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 3>he's asked me several times to try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.660
<v Speaker 3>He wants me to cook elk forum and he'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it because he'll know it's a hunted </v>

175
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 3>animal because he's a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want to eat anything that was</v>

176
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:10.870
<v Speaker 3>killed like from a factory farm or along</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>

177
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat meat either.</v>

178
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally I'll have fish.</v>

179
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.630
<v Speaker 3>When Ian and I fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time we fly together,</v>

180
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I take a picture of him five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the flight because he's always like</v>

181
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.180
<v Speaker 3>out cold five minutes and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

182
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:24.910
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's first thing in the morning.</v>

183
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:26.800
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just woke up.</v>

184
00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:29.470
<v Speaker 3>How are you going back to sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always so tired and I do.</v>

185
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

186
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:32.170
<v Speaker 3>you got to get blood work done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your fucking diet.</v>

187
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:34.290
<v Speaker 3>I know it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do that Vegan Diet.</v>

188
00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to be very disciplined.</v>

189
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

190
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:43.501
<v Speaker 3>You have to take all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments and you have to use algae if </v>

191
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.130
<v Speaker 3>algae,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the best source of b12.</v>

192
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not as bioavailable as animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>

193
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.440
<v Speaker 3>You know all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the fat soluble vitamins.</v>

194
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.940
<v Speaker 3>This is just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a nightmare.</v>

195
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 3>You've got to really be on the ball.</v>

196
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not know Ian.</v>

197
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he is on the ball very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

198
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Speaker 1>He was just on my podcast the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he taught it.</v>

199
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>It's called the struggle and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle,</v>

200
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>so I had about life in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just yes,</v>

201
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 1>that's an ongoing that in my dating </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle or the ongoing dating </v>

202
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>struggling and not having air </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning in.</v>

203
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 3>You had a nice fellow with you at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store the other night.</v>

204
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 3>He seemed like a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has since been recorded.</v>

205
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very brief.</v>

206
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you seem like a nice fellow.</v>

207
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I thought so too.</v>

208
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he's not nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had lived a lifestyle that I </v>

209
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we're not.</v>

210
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>We're not compatible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll still be friends.</v>

211
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can get to the point,</v>

212
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>won't be friends because we were friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

213
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So I think we can maintain that if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

214
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle.</v>

215
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Everything is a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The struggle is real evidence.</v>

216
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why I have people on it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just talk about stuff that everyone's.</v>

217
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's struggling with something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple things usually.</v>

218
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

219
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I find this is just a rash </v>
<v Speaker 3>generalization,</v>

220
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:03.351
<v Speaker 3>but I'm good at those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that women when they're in the </v>

221
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 3>prime of their life as a like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like 20,</v>

222
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.610
<v Speaker 3>but like as an actual grown woman with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>career and if they're smart and </v>

223
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 3>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a really hard time finding the</v>

224
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:18.130
<v Speaker 3>right man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

225
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're a that if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dingbat and you'll,</v>

226
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:27.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll morph into whatever lifestyle </v>

227
00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:29.331
<v Speaker 3>your new boyfriend chooses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can be okay because you don't </v>

228
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 3>know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard for a girl to find.</v>

229
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.740
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for a girl who's strong and </v>

230
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.271
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defined a guy who's not intimidated by </v>

231
00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is you.</v>

232
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 3>This is my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

233
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I know so many women who were in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation because women in their </v>

234

00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 3>He just passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rip Joe Jackson.</v>

273
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 3>We were just reading about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have been sending me these things</v>

274
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 3>that Dr Conrad Murray says that Michael </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson was chemically castrated.</v>

275
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

276
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had.</v>

277
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I said that a long time ago that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought he was [inaudible].</v>

278
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that the word for Toronto is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that they use to do two young </v>

279
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:46.140
<v Speaker 3>boys to get them to sing opera better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard this before?</v>

280
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if Aaron Neville has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

281
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just doing a falsetto </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you hear him he talks</v>

282
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.000
<v Speaker 1>like this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson also talk like this too.</v>

283
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.490
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was faint.</v>

284
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Bell is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear?</v>

285
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I speak it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Conrad Murray,</v>

286
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.740
<v Speaker 1>he taught his voice was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Murray has a recording on his </v>

287
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.860
<v Speaker 1>phone that he just played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

288
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.950
<v Speaker 1>There was some documentary I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched and it was Michael Jackson's </v>

289
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.190
<v Speaker 1>like last words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on his deathbed,</v>

290
00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his deep voice</v>

291
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.190
<v Speaker 4>woman to see the door</v>

292
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 3>fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like your girl does.</v>

293
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does like a girl want some Dick.</v>

294
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.070
<v Speaker 3>See that was his real voice to that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not deep,</v>

295
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

296
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Not this joined in a common purpose.</v>

297
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that is his deep voice.</v>

298
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like he's got a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like my eight year old.</v>

299
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Would she has a cold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one said it was deep,</v>

300
00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:57.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that this is what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do all of them.</v>

301
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Why does Janet talk like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the toy.</v>

302
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.940
<v Speaker 1>They all got beaten by their dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean?</v>

303
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So that now they all have this stay low </v>
<v Speaker 1>key they have to talk to.</v>

304
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

305
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 3>do you read the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chemical,</v>

306
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:14.671
<v Speaker 3>castor oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This play her a sound of a real cast </v>

307
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Toronto because there's only one </v>
<v Speaker 3>recording from the early 19 hundreds.</v>

308
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.490
<v Speaker 3>It was like some of the last of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] because they don't do that </v>

309
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.570
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they used to do it.</v>

310
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:27.571
<v Speaker 3>It was very common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would give their children to the </v>

311
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 3>opera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

312
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Will they get us kicked off youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>

313
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 3>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do some finagling.</v>

314
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 3>We get kicked off youtube all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

315
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Things that are other people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>copyrights here.</v>

316
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 3>This is a boy is a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

317
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 3>this is what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he needs to look like.</v>

318
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 3>he was castrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he had no hormones.</v>

320
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.470
<v Speaker 3>His body did not produce testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so this is a grown adult male,</v>

321
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.080
<v Speaker 3>but like saying like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't they just let the women </v>

322
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.080
<v Speaker 3>saying it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

323
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.510
<v Speaker 3>because it's a different thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>different sound.</v>

324
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Like the women sound beautiful and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound like women,</v>

325
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's a sound that [inaudible] has</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a Michael Jackson sound.</v>

326
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 3>The sound is a extremely feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not look,</v>

327
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

328
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Like if you think you see tito and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other Jackson's,</v>

329
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 3>they don't sound nothing with Jermaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not No one looks or sounds</v>

330
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.190
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

331
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely the standout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

332
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>So you think they did this to him when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a kid.</v>

333
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.880
<v Speaker 3>This is where Conrad Murray says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he looked.</v>

334
00:14:28.881 --> 00:14:33.881
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense if you look at his body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at like he didn't have any </v>

335
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.370
<v Speaker 3>muscle tone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very slender.</v>

336
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:37.100
<v Speaker 3>He looked like he had no testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sound like a girl.</v>

337
00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:42.101
<v Speaker 3>He sang like a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell him that it's human nature that </v>

338
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.720
<v Speaker 3>actually it's not bad to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

339
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Think about that voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck's things like,</v>

340
00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:47.630
<v Speaker 3>that's a man.</v>

341
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

342
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And I always thought he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

343
00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I never pictured him like four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took him for a sexual person at all.</v>

344
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Like when people were like they said he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was touching little boys.</v>

345
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I never believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt he was asexual.</v>

346
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:03.401
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get any type of sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any chemistry or any type of tension at </v>

347
00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 1>all from him.</v>

348
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Did you check them out with the Ligo </v>
<v Speaker 3>detector?</v>

349
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I have a gate the gate and I have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual.</v>

350
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I bought mine on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

351
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it's entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true because I've thought about </v>

352
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

353
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.940
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

354
00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>

355
00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I heard those kiss Kratos I know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

356
00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:27.100
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you Joe Jackson knew about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

357
00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:29.210
<v Speaker 3>I bet they did that to that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awful.</v>

358
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 3>So they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use chemical castration.</v>

359
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I heard that that had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always thought it was like for </v>

360
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>some reason I thought it was when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult.</v>

361
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like a personal choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he made.</v>

362
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

363
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:46.390
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea was his dad was trying </v>

364
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:46.390
<v Speaker 3>to preserve his voice.</v>

365
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

366
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.780
<v Speaker 1>So wait a chemical castration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what that means?</v>

367
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.610
<v Speaker 1>But with what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

368
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.760
<v Speaker 1>good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it something that you take that lid </v>

369
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.700
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like shrivel up your balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like something that just makes you </v>

370
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.980
<v Speaker 1>in like in like you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to produce test</v>

371
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.210
<v Speaker 3>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

372
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 3>let's find out here it says allegations </v>
<v Speaker 3>are Joe had Michael received Hormone </v>

373
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Jackson when he was 12 years old in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort to cure his acting and prevent </v>

374
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.431
<v Speaker 3>his voice from deepening an allegation </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mervis Marie previously made and it's </v>

375
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:20.560
<v Speaker 3>2016 self published book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the secret life of Dr Conrad </v>

376
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Murray and Michael Jackson.</v>

377
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:21.850
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

378
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said Joe was physically abusive to </v>

379
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.701
<v Speaker 3>him and his siblings were growing up but</v>
<v Speaker 3>never mentioned undergoing any sort of </v>

380
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:32.490
<v Speaker 3>hormonal treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is what Conrad Murray says,</v>

381
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

382
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:36.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you sound like crazy.</v>

383
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.260
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I believe it is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way sounded just make sense.</v>

384
00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And His dad was just a ruthless prick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was known as being a horrible person.</v>

385
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

386
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would he only do that to one of his </v>

387
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:51.360
<v Speaker 1>sons?</v>

388
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Because he was the only one that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>young enough to do it too.</v>

389
00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:55.620
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the Jackson five when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were taken off like,</v>

390
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.890
<v Speaker 3>oh baby gave me one moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was five,</v>

391
00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:00.600
<v Speaker 3>six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else was grown.</v>

392
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.800
<v Speaker 3>There was too late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

393
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 3>They were all deep in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were already there were already grown </v>

394
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was,</v>

395
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.780
<v Speaker 3>this was the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was the voice ABC.</v>

396
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was so fucking cute too.</v>

397
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:16.680
<v Speaker 3>They try to keep that going forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think that's unfortunate.</v>

398
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.330
<v Speaker 3>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's,</v>

399
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.150
<v Speaker 3>he's a cautionary tale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

400
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's a level of fame that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to where you just fucked up.</v>

401
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.470
<v Speaker 3>You got to fucking famous.</v>

402
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it?</v>

403
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it also like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain type of person only wants that</v>

404
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:36.140
<v Speaker 1>level of fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

405
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Like have you ever thought about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who get to like,</v>

406
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Donald trump level because it </v>

407
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just apply to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

408
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.830
<v Speaker 1>the entertainment industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like CEOS who these multibillion </v>

409
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>dollar own these multibillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

410
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 1>like it takes a certain type of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>to even want that type of clout,</v>

411
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

412
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's something in that </v>

413
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.070
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

414
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a pursuit involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things where you start off </v>

415
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.680
<v Speaker 3>just chasing money and you start off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get involved in a game and it's</v>

416
00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:09.440
<v Speaker 3>all about numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about putting scores up,</v>

417
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:14.470
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think as those scores continue to </v>

418
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.961
<v Speaker 3>pile on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you continue to get more excited about </v>

419
00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:16.961
<v Speaker 3>your progress and you want to keep going</v>
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>

420
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.500
<v Speaker 3>If someone makes a million dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

421
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.880
<v Speaker 3>they don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

422
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:20.930
<v Speaker 3>That's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

423
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:22.190
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want 2 million.</v>

424
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.460
<v Speaker 3>They make 2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a marriage and they get a </v>

425
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:27.460
<v Speaker 3>mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a jet,</v>

426
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.100
<v Speaker 3>they get a jet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fucking island.</v>

427
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I have always wondered like when is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough for people?</v>

428
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Because like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

429
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm the type of person I don't think I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like that.</v>

430
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Like if I had $25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars and somebody was like,</v>

431
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to do this to get another $25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million depending upon what it is.</v>

432
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:51.321
<v Speaker 1>If it was something that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in or something that wasn't </v>

433
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:51.321
<v Speaker 1>aligned with my morals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

434
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already have $25,000,000.</v>

435
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need it that bad.</v>

436
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's different though.</v>

437
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 3>You're saying like if something was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>aligned with your morals,</v>

438
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 3>but if you had $25,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had an opportunity to make 30.</v>

439
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>If it was yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are a couple extra hours a </v>

440
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that all it takes?</v>

441
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just a few.</v>

442
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 3>Five extra hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an extra hour a day.</v>

443
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 3>And we could ramp you up to $30,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>

444
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do that and then we go,</v>

445
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:16.560
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>$75,000,000</v>

447
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:24.771
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to have to work 12 </v>

448
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:24.771
<v Speaker 3>hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

450
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I can just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

451
00:19:27.371 --> 00:19:28.630
<v Speaker 3>I know you think it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but listen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>massage therapists that will be on staff</v>

453

<v Speaker 3>and if we do this for a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you retire comfortably for the rest of </v>

460
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.920

466
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low maintenance.</v>

467
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much is it to buy an island?</v>

468
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on where it is.</v>

469
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>If it's where hurricanes hit all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

470
00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 3>but you get to cheat and get it for 75.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody Richard Branson bought one last</v>

471
00:20:17.121 --> 00:20:22.121
<v Speaker 3>year and right after he bought it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got destroyed literally to the point </v>

472
00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:24.350
<v Speaker 3>where there are no living humans for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time in 300 years on this island.</v>

473
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do research.</v>

474
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just got unlucky.</v>

475
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.650
<v Speaker 3>He just bought it and right after he </v>
<v Speaker 3>bought it,</v>

476
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:38.651
<v Speaker 3>it literally the epicenter of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurricane washed over it and just the </v>

477
00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:43.181
<v Speaker 3>entire island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're listening to this Richard </v>

478
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:43.181
<v Speaker 3>Branson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

479
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:43.181
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to laugh at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull up the story.</v>

480
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Branson's island last time you've talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

481
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>a necker</v>

482
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 2>island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that he's owned for awhile,</v>

483
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.410
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be reopened and a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

484
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.520
<v Speaker 2>so they redid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like back back those necker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way that like niggardly</v>

486
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dangerous word.</v>

487
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Like selfish and stingy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are saying don't use that word </v>

488
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.490
<v Speaker 2>anymore because it sounds too much like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that other one does,</v>

489
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not,</v>

490
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is tricky.</v>

491
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:14.520
<v Speaker 2>You have to pronounce every letter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>delete.</v>

492
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Delete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

493
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's weird when words are </v>

494
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.290
<v Speaker 2>okay sometimes like pussy cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.900
<v Speaker 2>How do you have to have another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now the game,</v>

496
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that on daytime top.</v>

497
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That is weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

498
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:36.520
<v Speaker 2>That you could say pussy cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

499
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 2>But if you say pussy one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

500
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 2>three cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

502
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't like what you did there unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you named your cat pussy.</v>

503
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess octopussy remember that?</v>

504
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.270
<v Speaker 2>That was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's okay.</v>

505
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

506
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.080
<v Speaker 7>I remember seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

507
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.170
<v Speaker 7>this is what I think with when we lived </v>
<v Speaker 7>in New York,</v>

508
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 7>it was a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

509
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.690
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

510
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 7>I remember seeing it like I was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I remember seeing it like.</v>

511
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is a bad word to say it?</v>

512
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.310
<v Speaker 2>That was like a loophole in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

513
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.920
<v Speaker 2>There's some words that are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

514
00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:14.940
<v Speaker 2>how about a dude named Dick Cheney?</v>

515
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.080
<v Speaker 7>Everyone deserves that name.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I don't,</v>

516
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.330
<v Speaker 7>I don't know anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think,</v>

517
00:22:20.331 --> 00:22:21.830
<v Speaker 7>I think that's like one of those older </v>
<v Speaker 7>school ones.</v>

518
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.260
<v Speaker 7>I feel like no one goes by.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If your name is Richard,</v>

519
00:22:24.261 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 7>you go by Richard or rich.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I don't think anybody's like,</v>

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.520
<v Speaker 7>call me Dick.</v>

521
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.680

529
00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.310
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same amount of letters.</v>

530
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 2>It isn't it so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

531
00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Are there any ones like that for girls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will there's a.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't think of one.</v>

534
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no just named him Jack.</v>

535
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different name.</v>

536
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Sounds different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

537

<v Speaker 7>since we're on the,</v>

539
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.170
<v Speaker 7>on the nickname thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you know,</v>

540
00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:20.270
<v Speaker 7>we're not allowed to say tranny anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

541
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.760
<v Speaker 7>You just said it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know because I don't.</v>

542
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.020
<v Speaker 7>I personally don't find anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 7>with the word and now someone could very</v>

543
00:23:27.021 --> 00:23:27.440
<v Speaker 7>well say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

544
00:23:27.441 --> 00:23:29.390
<v Speaker 7>you're not transgender candace,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not bothered by it.</v>

545
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.430
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't affect you,</v>

546
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.490
<v Speaker 7>but I don't know anyone that really used</v>
<v Speaker 7>it in a derogatory way.</v>

547
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:37.860
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

548
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.400
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was just a word that we said to refer</v>

549
00:23:40.401 --> 00:23:44.870
<v Speaker 7>to this type of person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but to me it sounds adorable.</v>

550
00:23:44.871 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 7>Like me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just the nickname</v>

551
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>for transgender to say tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like Jennifer,</v>

552
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:54.221
<v Speaker 2>you call somebody Jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of policing of </v>

553
00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:57.011
<v Speaker 2>language as of late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ramped up because the Internet </v>

554
00:23:57.011 --> 00:24:00.010
<v Speaker 2>people can complain more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the problem is that it's </v>

555
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.371
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not putting any respect on that </v>

556
00:24:03.371 --> 00:24:03.371
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

557
00:24:03.371 --> 00:24:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like it's a birdman.</v>

<v Speaker 2>living as a up comedian.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's what you want,</v>

624
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 2>but even people who who don't do standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to kind of be stand ups.</v>

625
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:03.441
<v Speaker 2>They want to do a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Djs do radio djs secretly want </v>

626
00:27:06.261 --> 00:27:07.830
<v Speaker 2>to be comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they're hilarious.</v>

627
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them to do it secretly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

628
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>That you come in and do morning radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the like.</v>

629
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like the closest thing to what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

630
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:16.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what?</v>

631
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of another </v>
<v Speaker 2>profession which is like standup comedy </v>

632
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 2>where you can like tell jokes and people</v>

633
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.170

634
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a radio is the closest thing to</v>

637
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:34.020

<v Speaker 2>I think that's really what it is.</v>

638
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:39.170
<v Speaker 2>They also want to keep you on your heels</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know that you could do </v>

733
00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:24.501
<v Speaker 7>be the first purge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then it tells the origin of how the </v>

736
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.680
<v Speaker 7>I haven't heard of this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't,</v>

737
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Speaker 7>I didn't enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I enjoy it.</v>

738
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.830
<v Speaker 7>I enjoy it for many reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

739
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.530
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>There was acting problems.</v>

741

<v Speaker 7>that I felt the acting bothered me,</v>

743
00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:48.350
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the story.</v>

744
00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:50.810
<v Speaker 7>I just felt like it's one of those ones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like the premise is really good,</v>

745
00:31:50.811 --> 00:31:53.330
<v Speaker 7>but it's just not executed well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the idea of like,</v>

748
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.480
<v Speaker 7>it was a let down.</v>

749

<v Speaker 2>so she's a black chick who's like capen </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

755
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.670
<v Speaker 2>So I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean by nature I don't understand </v>

756
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:19.670
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's a woman.</v>

757
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.560
<v Speaker 2>She's a black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand it.</v>

758
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

759
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.400
<v Speaker 7>What is there to understand like you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>a womanizer who was also accused of rape</v>

760
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.260
<v Speaker 7>on numerous occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Also been,</v>

761
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a history of racism from his family.</v>

762
00:32:34.531 --> 00:32:35.850
<v Speaker 7>Like his father,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his father.</v>

763
00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:40.851
<v Speaker 7>You said it in his apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you said deny a renting apartments to </v>

764
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:40.851
<v Speaker 7>brown</v>

765
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 2>and black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like that he was raised with that.</v>

766
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

767
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 2>calling Mexicans rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't.</v>

768
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no explanation for supporting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

769
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I think as a black woman she found a </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche.</v>

770
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.790
<v Speaker 2>She did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly what it is.</v>

771
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:57.791
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think necessarily she </v>

772
00:32:57.791 --> 00:32:57.791
<v Speaker 2>believes what she say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

773
00:32:57.791 --> 00:32:57.791
<v Speaker 2>I think that she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

774
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.230
<v Speaker 2>this is a way for me to get famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're how many black she's,</v>

775
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is.</v>

776
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:03.110
<v Speaker 2>She's like the brand new Omarosa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

777
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>she's like new Amarosa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amarosa was on fear factor back in the </v>

778
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

779
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>she's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She accused me of being drunk on the </v>

780
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

781
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Talking to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

782
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 3>she didn't make any sense and so as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was saying,</v>

783
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

784
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you drunk?</v>

785
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

786
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smell liquor on your breath.</v>

787
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

788
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not drunk.</v>

789
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.500
<v Speaker 3>I was high as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't drunk.</v>

790
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.670
<v Speaker 2>That's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

791
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's just was like,</v>

792
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Amaros is out of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a step up.</v>

793
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.170
<v Speaker 2>We think so she could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

794
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 2>have we ever seen Tomi Lahren and her in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same room?</v>

795
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Because I think she could be Tomi Lahren</v>
<v Speaker 2>in blackface.</v>

796
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel.</v>

797
00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 2>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

798
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:45.761
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she needs more than blackface </v>

799
00:33:45.761 --> 00:33:45.761
<v Speaker 2>and need to change the nose a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

800
00:33:45.761 --> 00:33:49.310
<v Speaker 2>There's more it could have been awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of those girls that are</v>

801
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:54.311
<v Speaker 2>like interchangeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's lauren southern and Tomi </v>

802
00:33:54.311 --> 00:33:54.311
<v Speaker 2>Lahren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always get them confused.</v>

803
00:33:54.311 --> 00:33:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

804
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

805
00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't even know Lauren looks </v>

806
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:00.760
<v Speaker 2>like they look similar though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blond hair.</v>

807
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.900
<v Speaker 2>They're both cute blonde conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a market for that.</v>

808
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Of course there is because that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the norm.</v>

809
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's outside the norm is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to stick out and going to be like,</v>

810
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is trendy now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is what are a party now is </v>

813
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're expecting that they're going</v>

814
00:34:17.491 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 2>to attract a younger demographic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The millennials and it is.</v>

815
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's working somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

816
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely getting there some </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

817
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell what someone really </v>

818
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:32.820
<v Speaker 2>believes and what they want you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe right toward the toe.</v>

819
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Like global warming doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

820
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

821
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:39.930
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

822
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.300
<v Speaker 3>that is to me when she said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's indicative of someone who's </v>

823
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.600
<v Speaker 3>trying to follow a line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a line that you're supposed</v>

824
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:51.601
<v Speaker 3>to follow if you are a hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 3>republican supporter and it's like </v>

825
00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:53.920
<v Speaker 3>industry is good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big businesses,</v>

826
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:56.670
<v Speaker 3>good regulation is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:34:56.890 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 3>and then the big one is global warming's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hopes for at least global warming is </v>

828
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:06.970
<v Speaker 3>something that's greatly exaggerated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>these environmentalists in order to fund</v>

829
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.740
<v Speaker 3>our Gore's blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

830
00:35:08.741 --> 00:35:09.460
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

831
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 3>just go down these lines where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the left believes one thing and </v>

832
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:18.991
<v Speaker 3>everybody know there's certain things </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have to believe you're on the </v>

833
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:18.991
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

834
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:18.991
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

835
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Speaker 2>you have to believe you're on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you sound batshit crazy.</v>

836
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Like denying facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those.</v>

837
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be pro life pretty much.</v>

838
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few.</v>

839
00:35:27.821 --> 00:35:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people that are pro abortion,</v>

840
00:35:29.291 --> 00:35:31.470
<v Speaker 2>which is why isn't that what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>with right?</v>

841
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what happened with Tomi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lahren though?</v>

842
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Didn't she lose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lost some contracts she had.</v>

843
00:35:36.491 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 2>It may have been with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>

844
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

845
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 7>because she came out of saying she was </v>
<v Speaker 7>pro choice,</v>

846
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 7>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was the end she suffered.</v>

847
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.480
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're not allowed to have varying </v>

848
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.480
<v Speaker 3>opinions or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like an almost cult,</v>

849
00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.980
<v Speaker 3>like it's very cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

850
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

851
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.770
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens.</v>

852
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 3>I haven't watched that and my wife's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed.</v>

853
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

854
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.660
<v Speaker 7>there's a new episode that comes out </v>
<v Speaker 7>today.</v>

855
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:02.870
<v Speaker 7>I got to watch it but watch one episode </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

856
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 7>this is just too fucked up to reel to </v>
<v Speaker 7>reel.</v>

857
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:12.080
<v Speaker 7>You see the parallels like the kids </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting separated from their moms and </v>

858
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 7>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is literally happening right now.</v>

859
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 7>It's terrifying.</v>

860
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is one of the darker moments </v>

861
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.320
<v Speaker 3>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this era,</v>

862
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.810
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

863
00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge that thousands of kids get</v>
<v Speaker 3>separated from their parents as they </v>

864
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 3>crossed the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

865
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

866
00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

867
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no excuses.</v>

868
00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:29.230
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

869
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video that I made was just a </v>

870
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.590
<v Speaker 3>rant on the podcast about it with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend Duncan,</v>

871
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Duncan trussell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've met only a couple of times,</v>

872
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know him very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone loves him.</v>

873
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.970
<v Speaker 3>So we did this rant or I did this rant </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and it got made into a video </v>

874
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 3>and then all these people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

875
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand the real issue on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the border.</v>

876
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 3>If the real issue in the border </v>
<v Speaker 3>separating parents when their kids,</v>

877
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 3>that's not the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking idiot,</v>

878
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:57.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be keeping criminals </v>

879
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.710
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

880
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.710
<v Speaker 3>You think that lady and her baby are </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminals.</v>

881
00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.520
<v Speaker 3>Criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just imagine.</v>

882
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:05.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can imagine what it'd be like to </v>

883
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:05.530
<v Speaker 3>live in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right next to United States.</v>

884
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:06.160
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right there.</v>

885
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.640
<v Speaker 3>You just walk over there and get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right there.</v>

886
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.450
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over here,</v>

887
00:37:09.451 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Speaker 3>you're far better life right over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your cousin got killed by the cartel for</v>

888
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:15.420
<v Speaker 3>looking at somebody wrong at a taco </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand.</v>

889
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you just.</v>

890
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever goes to jail for it.</v>

891
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how many fucking politicians</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed in Mexico this year?</v>

892
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.370
<v Speaker 3>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

893
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 3>the number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody was just telling me.</v>

894
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more,</v>

895
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:29.520
<v Speaker 3>it's more than a hundred this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politicians murdered in Mexico.</v>

896
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.790
<v Speaker 7>The go to place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're going to murder somebody,</v>

897
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's right there and it's.</v>

898
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.920
<v Speaker 7>And they never investigated anything </v>
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>

899
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.120
<v Speaker 7>And what's the number of 3,232</v>
<v Speaker 7>politicians killed this year.</v>

900
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.610
<v Speaker 7>One hundred and 32.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we know this?</v>

901
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Mexico goes to the polls this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 32 politicians have been </v>

902
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.250
<v Speaker 3>killed since campaigning began.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

903
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.450
<v Speaker 3>that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Record violence.</v>

904
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.710
<v Speaker 3>All because of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all because of the drug war.</v>

905
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.870
<v Speaker 3>If we just made drugs legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be none of this going on.</v>

906
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is worse than the one Pablo Escobar</v>

907
00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:08.320
<v Speaker 3>was out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

908
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar situation.</v>

909
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all fueled by drug money.</v>

910
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this is drug money.</v>

911
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you make drugs illegal,</v>

912
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.870
<v Speaker 3>only criminals are selling drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's massive amounts of money because</v>

913
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.510
<v Speaker 3>people love that cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

914
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 7>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever tried cocaine?</v>

915
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.360
<v Speaker 7>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 7>never made any of them ever.</v>

916
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.550
<v Speaker 7>I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No I won't,</v>

917
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.820
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what I won't try.</v>

918
00:38:28.821 --> 00:38:33.440
<v Speaker 7>Like I prefer like I've done shrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 7>weed and that's it.</v>

919
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 7>How often do you do shrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Often.</v>

920
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 7>How often do you do weed?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even like the only way that I </v>

921
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 7>have is given to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

922
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:46.051
<v Speaker 7>when I'll do light when all judge roast </v>
<v Speaker 7>battle and they pay you and we'd hear </v>

923
00:38:46.051 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 7>the bag of weed and then it takes me </v>
<v Speaker 7>like years to go through it.</v>

924
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 7>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how infrequently.</v>

925
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 7>Like I'll smoke when I'm with friends </v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not,</v>

926
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 7>I don't drink by myself and I don't like</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I go home.</v>

927
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 7>Like I'd had a bottle of liquor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a vodka that's been in my freezer over a</v>

928
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:01.680
<v Speaker 7>year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you're healthy.</v>

929
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.430
<v Speaker 7>I'm very healthy and very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you smoke weed,</v>

930
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 7>you ever get paranoid?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This one time I did an edible.</v>

931
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 7>I ate too much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

932
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 7>Gemara neighbors.</v>

933
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 7>A very funny comic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He gave me an edible one time and this </v>

934
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:19.981
<v Speaker 7>was before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like anybody could just walk into a </v>

935
00:39:19.981 --> 00:39:21.871
<v Speaker 7>dispensary because now you just have to </v>
<v Speaker 7>show your id and you can get anything </v>

936
00:39:21.871 --> 00:39:25.351
<v Speaker 7>from the dispensary,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but this is when you had to have a a </v>

937
00:39:25.351 --> 00:39:25.351
<v Speaker 7>card.</v>

938
00:39:25.351 --> 00:39:28.230
<v Speaker 7>So he went in and got it for me and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was this lemon bar that said award </v>

939
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 7>winning on it and me being the weed </v>
<v Speaker 7>novice,</v>

<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

941
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 7>this is going to be award winning </v>
<v Speaker 7>because of the taste.</v>

942
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:34.440
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like probably upset.</v>

943
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.450
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is like a Paula deen recipe,</v>

944
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:42.451
<v Speaker 7>and so I ate like half of it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 7>by myself and I woke up.</v>

945
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 7>I was laying down and I was in my bed </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I sat up and I said,</v>

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 7>am I talking to myself?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not talking to myself.</v>

947
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.180
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I am talking to myself.</v>

948
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:55.840

<v Speaker 7>I and I was saying this out loud.</v>

949
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.250
<v Speaker 7>I have to check.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went on my phone to get on twitter to </v>

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.871
<v Speaker 7>see the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>make sure the world was still happening </v>

951
00:40:03.871 --> 00:40:03.871

<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

952
00:40:03.871 --> 00:40:04.150
<v Speaker 7>I felt like I was in some weird twilight</v>
<v Speaker 7>zone.</v>

953
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:09.740
<v Speaker 7>It was awful.</v>

<v Speaker 7>So I forced myself to go to sleep.</v>

956
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.980
<v Speaker 7>I woke up the next morning,</v>

1036
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 2>but you'll waste training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes me on the road with him </v>

1037
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.991
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and willing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time we were in like a cvs and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>They like their corsets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read articles that you see you're </v>

1043
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:20.070
<v Speaker 2>not supposed to wear these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it binds.</v>

1044
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for your organs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your organs around the Kardashians wear </v>

1045
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.440

<v Speaker 3>I can say it.</v>

1068
00:45:16.991 --> 00:45:19.630
<v Speaker 3>You can't say it growing up thick </v>
<v Speaker 3>thighs,</v>

1069
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:20.860
<v Speaker 3>a thick ass,</v>

1070
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 7>but even so like women,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can say that and we know that men,</v>

1071
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:29.630
<v Speaker 7>some men are a lot of men like it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but being called fic does net never </v>

1072
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:34.011
<v Speaker 7>makes us feel good about ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even if even if we know that men like </v>

1073
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it still makes it the back of our head.</v>

1074
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 7>We're like,</v>

1075
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:37.850
<v Speaker 3>what does he mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fat?</v>

1076
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.700
<v Speaker 3>What's all this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should have guaranteed this girls out</v>

1077
00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:42.650
<v Speaker 3>there that like being thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1078
00:45:42.651 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1079
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:45.290
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1080
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.900
<v Speaker 7>but a lot of women when they know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've had conversations with other women </v>

1081
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:50.900
<v Speaker 7>that had been like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh look,</v>

1082
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 7>I used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I was in high school,</v>

1083
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.380
<v Speaker 7>I was probably 20,</v>
<v Speaker 7>25 pounds heavier than what I am right </v>

1084
00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lots of carbs,</v>

1085
00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:59.360
<v Speaker 7>lots of carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>lot.</v>

1086
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know how to eat properly </v>
<v Speaker 7>because.</v>

1087
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:06.830
<v Speaker 7>So there was a whole low fat craze.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You remember this when snackwells was </v>

1088
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.110
<v Speaker 7>popping,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you remember that and they,</v>

1089
00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 7>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1090
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.860
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fat,</v>

1091
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:15.890
<v Speaker 7>high fat is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they started doing low fat </v>

1092
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.171
<v Speaker 7>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then they replaced the fat with </v>

1093
00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:18.171
<v Speaker 7>sugar so it would taste palatable,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1094
00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:19.170
<v Speaker 7>because if you take the fat out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the flavors going,</v>

1095
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 7>so like how do we get the flavor back?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they put a bunch of sugar and stuff.</v>

1096
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 7>So you're eating like thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh it's low fat.</v>

1097
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 7>I would come home and he'd like a bag of</v>
<v Speaker 7>like low fat pretzels,</v>

1098
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 7>things like a bag of those snyder's of </v>
<v Speaker 7>Hanover.</v>

1099
00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 7>Brett's a bag,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of those big ones and be like,</v>

1100
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 7>why am I gaining weight?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I didn't know.</v>

1101
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 7>I thought low fat man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh I would.</v>

1102
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 7>It's low fat,</v>

1103
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.310
<v Speaker 3>no fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much of that.</v>

1104
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.580
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of those low fat items </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are way worse for you.</v>

1105
00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even know.</v>

1106
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 7>I mean are people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even think that's a thing.</v>

1107
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 7>Now it's gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gluten free is what's,</v>

1108
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.120
<v Speaker 7>what's popular.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gluten free.</v>

1109
00:46:52.121 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 7>And</v>

1110
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.270
<v Speaker 3>what's the other thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think there's another thing </v>

1111
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.691
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of trending right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just not just gluten </v>

1112
00:47:02.691 --> 00:47:02.691
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're talking about?</v>

1113
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.470
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what I'm thinking about.</v>

1114
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.870
<v Speaker 7>I literally had a brain fart,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there is something else.</v>

1115
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:11.960
<v Speaker 7>Maybe Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a new trendy thing.</v>

1116
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's all like nobody knows what the </v>

1117
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 7>repercussions of any of these things </v>
<v Speaker 7>are.</v>

1118
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.681
<v Speaker 7>Like Paleo might be good for temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in the longterm we don't know the </v>

1119
00:47:20.681 --> 00:47:20.681
<v Speaker 7>damage is going to be doing</v>

1120
00:47:20.681 --> 00:47:22.100
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paleo is real simple.</v>

1121
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.830
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to do any damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paleo is just real food.</v>

1122
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Paleo just means no grain and no rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it means.</v>

1123
00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.300
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No preservatives,</v>

1124
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 3>artificial flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no artificial colors,</v>

1125
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 3>just meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>

1126
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>

1127
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>

1128
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:36.160
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>

1129
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.130
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not the.</v>

1130
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about that trend</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

1131
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Is this going to be able to go like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>low fat trend does.</v>

1132
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a normal thing for people to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said fruits to you.</v>

1133
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:49.090
<v Speaker 3>They can do fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruits.</v>

1134
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this people that eat carnivore diet,</v>

1135
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 3>this is the more most recent one where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they only eat meat.</v>

1136
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.940
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1137
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1138
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that's not good?</v>

1139
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend with pretty severe </v>
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune disease and it's gone because</v>

1140
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:08.881
<v Speaker 3>of eating only carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His daughter had her hip replaced and </v>

1141
00:48:08.881 --> 00:48:08.881
<v Speaker 3>her ankle replaced.</v>

1142
00:48:08.881 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 3>She has terrible arthritis with </v>
<v Speaker 3>carnivore diet gone.</v>

1143
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Some people have a really adverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to carbohydrates,</v>

1144
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 3>fruits and vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1145
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not eating anything and he's been </v>

1146
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:22.380
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a professor.</v>

1147
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant guy.</v>

1148
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.450
<v Speaker 3>What's his cholesterol look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1149
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:27.190
<v Speaker 3>See you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say things like that,</v>

1150
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.030
<v Speaker 3>like you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1151
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.240
<v Speaker 3>That's not where cholesterol comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dietary cholesterol doesn't have any </v>

1152
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.900
<v Speaker 3>impact on blood lipids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any impact on your blood</v>

1153
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:39.901
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where cholesterol is bad when </v>

1154
00:48:39.901 --> 00:48:40.630
<v Speaker 3>you have cholesterol and high </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>

1155
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.380
<v Speaker 3>because when your body is burning a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of carbohydrates,</v>

1156
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.680
<v Speaker 3>your body is in fat storing mode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you eat a bunch of fat and </v>

1157
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're asking me get fat as fuck,</v>

1158
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 3>but if you do just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you adjust the famil fat,</v>

1159
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 3>then your body loses weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe it or not,</v>

1160
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.610
<v Speaker 3>you actually get slim.</v>

1161
00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1162
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I know about that part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know the cholesterol part.</v>

1163
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1164
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.900
<v Speaker 3>If you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one the important thing for </v>

1165
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:06.900
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are on a high fat,</v>

1166
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.551
<v Speaker 3>low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot eat large amounts of </v>

1167
00:49:11.551 --> 00:49:14.131
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates because if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to go right to fat </v>

1168
00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 3>because your body just is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's going to use what's going to</v>

1169
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.910
<v Speaker 3>burn carbohydrates and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take all the fat you take in and just </v>

1170
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:22.330
<v Speaker 3>store it so you just going to get fat as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1171
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without this body positivity,</v>

1172
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 3>that's how do you know that's not what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1173
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.050
<v Speaker 3>That you want to get fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>

1174
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:32.150
<v Speaker 3>So that can be body positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>body positive.</v>

1175
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Is that what that is?</v>

1176
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.750
<v Speaker 7>It's just embraced the fatness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's literally just being like if you're</v>

1177
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.280
<v Speaker 7>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>love your body and that's fine.</v>

1178
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:42.340
<v Speaker 7>Like you can be fat and love your body,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's also promoting,</v>

1179
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:43.900
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unhealthy behaviors.</v>

1180
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.930
<v Speaker 7>I think also,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we want to distinguish between the </v>

1181
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:48.930
<v Speaker 7>two.</v>

1182
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to give people a free pass by </v>

1183
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 3>saying be body positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1184
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:52.090
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fat shame,</v>

1185
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.970

<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do taekwondo Id fat shame.</v>

1188
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.890

<v Speaker 7>stinky armpits.</v>

1190
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 3>It used to be easy to fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shame.</v>

1191
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Now people are super upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1193
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really not.</v>

1194
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:21.170
<v Speaker 7>Well it's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean you should make fun of </v>

1195
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.170
<v Speaker 7>somebody for the way they look.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

1196
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.071
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we shouldn't be promoting an </v>

1197
00:50:25.071 --> 00:50:25.071
<v Speaker 7>unhealthy lifestyle.</v>

1198
00:50:25.071 --> 00:50:29.730
<v Speaker 3>That too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also by Tom Secura said that like </v>

1199
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 3>people making fun of his weight is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why he lost weight.</v>

1200
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 3>He was like fat shaming was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective on me.</v>

1201
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>He lost the weight because people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat shaming.</v>

1202
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of behaviors.</v>

1203
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:40.870
<v Speaker 1>A lot of behaviors or because you felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>shame and we're in.</v>

1204
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.400
<v Speaker 1>We're in a society where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no shame anymore.</v>

1205
00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:46.140
<v Speaker 1>There's no shame with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1206
00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I know people that are like proud of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their alcoholism.</v>

1207
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people bragging about Duis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1208
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hanging around with the wrong people or </v>

1209
00:50:59.960 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 1>they're not my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1210
00:50:59.960 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it.</v>

1211
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.390
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that that's an escape </v>
<v Speaker 3>clause?</v>

1212
00:51:03.391 --> 00:51:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1213
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.710
<v Speaker 3>they're giving themselves an out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I love being an alcoholic.</v>

1214
00:51:07.711 --> 00:51:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

1215
00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to them it's because of we're </v>

1216
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>accepting everything now that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1217
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1218
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fun behavior.</v>

1219
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm fun when I'm drunk and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

1220
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be fun.</v>

1221
00:51:19.111 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.150
<v Speaker 1>there's Uber's take a lyft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you driving?</v>

1223
00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 3>The especially today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no excuse for that,</v>

1225
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.830
<v Speaker 3>especially in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that fucking comedy store parking</v>

1226
00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:35.831
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get out of it because it's </v>

1227
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:35.831
<v Speaker 3>always jammed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lifts and Hoover's.</v>

1228
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:35.831
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is great,</v>

1229
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 3>but also it is annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's annoying.</v>

1230
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:41.261
<v Speaker 3>It's annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's great that people are taking </v>

1231
00:51:41.261 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to drive them around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing about Uber says like how</v>

1232
00:51:43.431 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 3>much background check and they do it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>those freaks.</v>

1233
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1234
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm positive I've gotten into a lyft </v>

1235
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:51.660
<v Speaker 1>driver or uber driver because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1236
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I used to do uber and then they suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I started doing lyft,</v>

1237
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I got an uber at one point </v>

1238
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.970
<v Speaker 1>where somebody was drunker than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe let me get this.</v>

1239
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not checking them right?</v>

1240
00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:03.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

1241
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1242
00:52:06.221 --> 00:52:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like being.</v>

1243
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't drink at all to you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do?</v>

1244
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I have such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonaddictive a personality and I feel </v>

1245
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.721
<v Speaker 1>that most people are addicted to things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's also tough for me,</v>

1246
00:52:22.571 --> 00:52:26.680
<v Speaker 1>like a dating also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because I know I'd see.</v>

1247
00:52:26.681 --> 00:52:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I know that a lot of people that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:30.790
<v Speaker 1>been on dates with or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1249
00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:35.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lifestyle is not conducive to what </v>

1250
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we just don't click in that way</v>

1251
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.700
<v Speaker 3>because you find you go on dates with </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are getting fucked up.</v>

1252
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot,</v>

1253
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:40.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

1254
00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So much so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>UHM,</v>

1255
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.900
<v Speaker 1>weekend nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Weeknights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Any day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Tuesday?</v>

1258
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Why am I not drunk yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1259
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

1260
00:52:50.861 --> 00:52:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the last APP that I got on with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1261
00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:58.621
<v Speaker 1>it's called meet mindful because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to find people who were viewed as</v>

1262
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:05.190
<v Speaker 1>somebody who is just more present and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe likes themself a little bit more </v>

1263
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.480
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have to get drunk all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to be with themselves.</v>

1264
00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd that work out?</v>

1265
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1266
00:53:10.001 --> 00:53:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay $30 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1267
00:53:13.211 --> 00:53:14.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not looking for love right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1268
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid before for like eharmony.</v>

1269
00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what I paid for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid almost $200 for that one.</v>

1270
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:21.910
<v Speaker 1>How would that work out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terribly.</v>

1271
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm hesitant to pay again</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got nothing.</v>

1272
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I got literally nothing</v>

1273
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.090
<v Speaker 7>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm like,</v>

1274
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I feel like one sentence,</v>

<v Speaker 2>dreams and then you sit down with them </v>

1276
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:34.211
<v Speaker 2>on a couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a video with you,</v>

1277

1305
00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.250
<v Speaker 7>When there was a phase where I was </v>
<v Speaker 7>swiping white didn't work out.</v>

<v Speaker 7>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing else.</v>

1316
00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:18.770
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the two are not mutually exclusive.</v>

1317

<v Speaker 7>You're not even sure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muscles.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Twice.</v>

1331
00:55:52.731 --> 00:55:57.731

1353
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 2>If I wanted that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be on tinder.</v>

1354
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those tended to move.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're so lucky.</v>

1356
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't know about any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tinder is the Dick App.</v>

1357
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:50.270
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you just want some Dick and even </v>

1358
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 2>bumble is kind of turning into that,</v>

1360
00:56:56.051 --> 00:57:01.051
<v Speaker 2>I was on that one for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this thing that said that </v>

1361
00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:03.781
<v Speaker 2>there's a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was made me angry that it said his </v>

1362
00:57:03.781 --> 00:57:07.711
<v Speaker 2>tinder and Grindr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they responsible in any way for the </v>

1363
00:57:07.711 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 2>spread of stds from their apps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1364
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1365
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Of course they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't owe a goddamn thing.</v>

1366
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't be in their dicks and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely like they're not,</v>

1367
00:57:17.081 --> 00:57:17.350
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1368
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be sued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's ridiculous.</v>

1369
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 2>But were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they,</v>

1370
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.630
<v Speaker 2>should they take responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take responsibility.</v>

1371
00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:27.631
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guarantee that more people are </v>

1372
00:57:27.631 --> 00:57:27.631

<v Speaker 2>these apps and doing it unsafely.</v>

1379
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:41.160

<v Speaker 2>You want people to be responsible.</v>

1380
00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 2>It's taking personal responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own mistakes.</v>

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking to a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1394
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:20.931
<v Speaker 1>what if you didn't know that rule and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you accidentally leave the curtain open </v>

1395
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:22.230
<v Speaker 1>just because you didn't close it </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1396
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden some dude is</v>

1397
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:29.530
<v Speaker 2>every time I've been in gyms around gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or gay,</v>

1398
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I used to belong to Gold's gym on Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in West Hollywood.</v>

1400
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's where we used to film </v>
<v Speaker 2>newsradio right down the street from.</v>

1401
00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the gym that I worked out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>gay disco.</v>

1403
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:46.430
<v Speaker 2>And when I would go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it's anything wrong with that,</v>

1404
00:58:46.431 --> 00:58:48.650
<v Speaker 2>but when I would go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1405
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You would get that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That girl gets all the time.</v>

1406
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>

1407
00:58:54.381 --> 00:58:55.970
<v Speaker 2>That's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these eyes on me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>someone's trying to fuck you go unsafe </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1409
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:59.870

<v Speaker 2>It's a different feel like girls hitting</v>

<v Speaker 2>on use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want you can come over here </v>

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson when he's not using his </v>
<v Speaker 2>falsetto voice.</v>

1414
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:15.200
<v Speaker 2>But it's an uncomfortable feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that guys want to fuck you.</v>

1415
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I couldn't imagine being a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just trying to navigate my way through </v>

1435
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Here's my e harmony profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The terrifying part is that I don't know</v>

1436
01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:12.461
<v Speaker 2>who it was and it could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be someone I know and even the </v>

1437
01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:13.940
<v Speaker 2>way my neighbors described him was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually,</v>

1438
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:19.030
<v Speaker 2>the way they described him did describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that I know and consider a </v>

1439
01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

1440
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when I showed my neighbor the </v>

1441
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>picture of the person I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1443
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still now in the back of my head,</v>

1444
01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it was so now my friendship with</v>

1445
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:30.320
<v Speaker 2>this person has been a little strained </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of it.</v>

1446
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the life of a girl.</v>

1453
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Well they are,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you wrong them and you cheated on </v>

<v Speaker 2>What's the craziest</v>

1485
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.840
<v Speaker 7>thing a girlfriend has ever done to you?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Have you gotten your car key before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1487
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:34.690
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been pretty good at navigating </v>

1488
01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:35.050
<v Speaker 3>those waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got.</v>

1489
01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got pretty good,</v>

1490
01:02:35.991 --> 01:02:37.700
<v Speaker 3>crazy radar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1491
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.800
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when they're really hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really hot and they're also </v>

1492
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:42.800
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1493
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.010
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this might be worth the risk.</v>

1494
01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:43.850
<v Speaker 3>That's usually what</v>

1495
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.770
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you've seen this.</v>

1496
01:02:45.771 --> 01:02:50.771

1497
01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:54.011
<v Speaker 7>chart and it was like a chart of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 7>to hotness and it's.</v>

1498
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:57.740
<v Speaker 7>It's like all the hot chicks are always </v>
<v Speaker 7>crazy.</v>

1499
01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:02.741
<v Speaker 7>Instead if you'd have to and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>basically tells you in what range you </v>

1500
01:03:02.741 --> 01:03:02.741
<v Speaker 7>have to find the normal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One</v>

<v Speaker 3>woman really funny.</v>

<v Speaker 3>neurotic and they crossover like a venn </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagram.</v>

1504
01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.610
<v Speaker 3>They hit this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit this crossroad there.</v>

1505
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 3>They're like the two interchangeable </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1506
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Completely closely related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotic,</v>

1507
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:28.820
<v Speaker 3>neurotic and erotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right all together and see if you get </v>

1508
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 3>the really erotic women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're almost always psychotic or,</v>

1509
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 3>or neurotic or crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something wrong.</v>

1510
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Red Flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The really fun ones.</v>

1512
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just the ones that really want to </v>

1513
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.370
<v Speaker 3>rock your world there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're crazy.</v>

1514
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:44.830
<v Speaker 7>I've heard that and so if you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>wondering,</v>

1515
01:03:44.831 --> 01:03:49.831
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm very normal again.</v>

1516
01:03:50.591 --> 01:03:53.410
<v Speaker 7>My parents loved me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which means I don't do anal.</v>

1517
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a weird thing,</v>

1518
01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your parents love you too much,</v>

1519
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.670
<v Speaker 3>you might not be as ambitious.</v>

1520
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:06.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that is true,</v>

1521
01:04:06.641 --> 01:04:09.460
<v Speaker 7>like I wish I told her like I think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>definitely ambitious,</v>

1522
01:04:09.461 --> 01:04:11.140
<v Speaker 7>like I'm definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1523
01:04:11.141 --> 01:04:16.141
<v Speaker 7>I've been doing this for like 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 7>now and it's like I have come so far.</v>

1524
01:04:16.331 --> 01:04:17.170
<v Speaker 7>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1525
01:04:17.171 --> 01:04:22.171
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I definitely have goals and achieving </v>

1526
01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:22.171
<v Speaker 7>them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's also,</v>

1527
01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:22.171
<v Speaker 7>I'm also not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1528
01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:25.060
<v Speaker 7>we were talking about earlier like the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ceos of these corporations,</v>

1529
01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:30.061
<v Speaker 7>like I don't have that kind of drive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I just want to do what I love and </v>

1530
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:31.060
<v Speaker 7>make good money doing it to be lifted up</v>
<v Speaker 7>for 10 years.</v>

1531
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.940
<v Speaker 7>Where'd you start here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>At the store.</v>

1532
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:37.420
<v Speaker 7>Not Store,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like in la I started uh,</v>

1533
01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:38.800
<v Speaker 7>the first place I got up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1534
01:04:38.801 --> 01:04:43.801
<v Speaker 7>doing open mics and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't want to go to the store at </v>

1535
01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:46.351
<v Speaker 7>first because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to go there if I'm not </v>

1536
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:46.351
<v Speaker 7>funny yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then who knows,</v>

1537
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:46.351
<v Speaker 7>going to see me and they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1538
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:47.620
<v Speaker 7>she's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When did you get past the store?</v>

1539
01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:51.910
<v Speaker 7>Like December of 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So almost 2015,</v>

1540
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.490
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that was right when I came back.</v>

1541
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was right when you came back because </v>

1542
01:04:59.550 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 7>that was right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was the first.</v>

1543
01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:01.360
<v Speaker 7>Me and [inaudible] were the first people</v>
<v Speaker 7>that Adam passed when he got promoted to</v>

1544
01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:03.450
<v Speaker 7>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1545
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 7>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if Tommy was ever going to </v>

1546
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 7>pass me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know</v>

1547
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's a whole.</v>

1548
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.160
<v Speaker 3>So when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1549
01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 3>when I came back there I got to see like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole new crop.</v>

1550
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole new crop of people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seven years that I was gone.</v>

1551
01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Was it seven years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gone for seven years.</v>

1552
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'd be gone forever if Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Tommy had fired and Adam take over.</v>

1553
01:05:29.321 --> 01:05:30.330
<v Speaker 3>I was still been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

1554
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.450
<v Speaker 3>that was the dumbest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1555
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Miss Decision for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a good decision.</v>

1556
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.840
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was healthy.</v>

1557
01:05:37.841 --> 01:05:39.310
<v Speaker 3>To get away from the store for a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

1558
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.740
<v Speaker 3>sort of changed my comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made it a little less evil.</v>

1559
01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Blazes so harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but haven't you noticed that the energy </v>

1560
01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.120
<v Speaker 3>has changed since taking over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different place.</v>

1561
01:05:54.121 --> 01:05:59.121
<v Speaker 3>It's a different place without Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different place just because of </v>

1562
01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 3>the vibe of the comedy store is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also fortified by the Internet.</v>

1563
01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like people who love the place </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's this iconic historical </v>

1564
01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 3>landmark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Mecca of comedy.</v>

1565
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 3>It really is the Mecca in the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1566
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:13.780
<v Speaker 3>It's the real Mecca work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>

1567
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 3>when I was first starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had heard about the comedy store,</v>

1568
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:22.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Sam kinison started out there </v>

1569
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:22.040
<v Speaker 3>and Richard Pryor was always there and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked.</v>

1570
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.050
<v Speaker 3>That was the place I needed to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store.</v>

1571
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.440
<v Speaker 3>When I came out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was already on a Sitcom and I didn't </v>

1572
01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.010
<v Speaker 3>get passed at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a non paid regular,</v>

1573
01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:32.200
<v Speaker 3>so I was able to go on at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>

1574
01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.560
<v Speaker 3>When I first got here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got passed as a paid regular,</v>

1575
01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 3>it was like the happiest moment of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1576
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1577
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm a paid regular at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that to me was bigger than being on</v>

1578
01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:45.610
<v Speaker 3>a television show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here,</v>

1579
01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 3>but back then the comedy store was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ghost town.</v>

1580
01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.280
<v Speaker 3>It was deserted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was no one.</v>

1581
01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:54.070
<v Speaker 3>There you go on a Friday night to be 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the audience.</v>

1582
01:06:54.071 --> 01:06:58.300
<v Speaker 3>It was just gross and there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>boat acts still floating around.</v>

1583
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 3>So like something happened between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinison Age,</v>

1584
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennison age was like 84,</v>

1585
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:09.630
<v Speaker 3>87,</v>
<v Speaker 3>88 and in that time that guy was just </v>

1586
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:14.280
<v Speaker 3>running rampant and destroying and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a maniac and he was the top of the </v>

1587
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:19.591
<v Speaker 3>world and then he dropped off and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he died and then when he died,</v>

1588
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.280
<v Speaker 3>that place was a ghost town.</v>

1589
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.380
<v Speaker 3>So when I came along right after he </v>
<v Speaker 3>died,</v>

1590
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.200
<v Speaker 3>I came along in [inaudible] 94 and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was no one there.</v>

1591
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:29.410
<v Speaker 3>So it went from being this jam packed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally always here.</v>

1592
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:34.411
<v Speaker 3>Like all these celebrities come to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennison do spots late at night and be </v>

1593
01:07:34.411 --> 01:07:34.411
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1594
01:07:34.411 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 3>that must have been nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Belushi be there and Jack Nicholson</v>

1595
01:07:37.061 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 3>and all these different people and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go there.</v>

1596
01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was John Belushi was probably dead by</v>

1597
01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:45.060
<v Speaker 3>then when the John Belushi died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died in 18.</v>

1598
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:46.860
<v Speaker 3>80 two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 3>He died earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have said John Belushi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've made that up,</v>

1601
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:57.300
<v Speaker 3>but I know Jack Nicholson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other celebrities use </v>

1602
01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Kennison and I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1603
01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.480
<v Speaker 3>nobody famous comes here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a shit hole.</v>

1604
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:03.520
<v Speaker 3>There was nobody there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's different now.</v>

1605
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1606
01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 3>now it's every show sold out every show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every show.</v>

1607
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:10.660
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last time it was crazy.</v>

1608
01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:12.740
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking that the other day was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1609
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 3>what a time for me to be like a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the store.</v>

1610
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Like it</v>

1611
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:21.040
<v Speaker 7>just happened at the perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it just because I know so many </v>

1612
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.800
<v Speaker 7>people that were like were door guys </v>
<v Speaker 7>back when like,</v>

1613
01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:27.801
<v Speaker 7>and I've heard stories like bobby would </v>
<v Speaker 7>tell me stories from when he used to </v>

1614
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:30.641
<v Speaker 7>work there and like Freddy Lockhart and </v>
<v Speaker 7>when they were like door guys and I'm </v>

1615
01:08:30.641 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 7>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that sounds so shitty.</v>

1616
01:08:32.271 --> 01:08:33.530
<v Speaker 7>And like what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were getting paid.</v>

1617
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 7>They're getting paid like $25 for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>

1618
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.310
<v Speaker 7>Awful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I met Bob,</v>

1671
01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.680
<v Speaker 7>That was my first white man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I knew you from fear factor,</v>

1672
01:10:56.681 --> 01:10:58.090
<v Speaker 7>but I also,</v>

01:10:58.091 --> 01:10:59.150
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for,</v>

<v Speaker 7>standup and I'm watching the Chappelle </v>

<v Speaker 7>show and I just remember I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It makes me laugh so much.</v>

1676
01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:09.010
<v Speaker 7>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my feet are strong,</v>

1677
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.280

<v Speaker 7>I like,</v>

1678
01:11:11.281 --> 01:11:16.281
<v Speaker 7>I've tried to do crack impressions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>crack Ad Impressions for jokes before </v>

1679
01:11:16.281 --> 01:11:21.200
<v Speaker 7>and I can't because every time I try to </v>
<v Speaker 7>do an original crack head impression </v>

1682
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:31.020

<v Speaker 7>crackhead is now tyrone Brigham's and it</v>

1683
01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:31.530

1684
01:11:31.531 --> 01:11:36.531
<v Speaker 7>I can't do it because I can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tyrone becomes on certain people that </v>

1685
01:11:36.531 --> 01:11:37.620

<v Speaker 7>that that's the crack head for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

1687
01:11:40.831 --> 01:11:43.400
<v Speaker 7>for the rest of time out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Was only two seasons and that it was 15 </v>

<v Speaker 3>I was on it.</v>

1695
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I was on comedy central at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw like the management and how it was</v>

1696
01:12:14.671 --> 01:12:16.440

<v Speaker 3>It was chaos.</v>

1697
01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 3>And then whenever you tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't funny,</v>

1698
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 3>that are executives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them to manage funny.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Make the most funny and let him and Neal</v>

1703
01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Brennan go figure out what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just get out of the way.</v>

1704
01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Get out of the way and put ads on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1705
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.080

<v Speaker 3>would get more ads.</v>

1711
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:55.870
<v Speaker 3>It was all about people not comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>with advertising with certain kinds of </v>

<v Speaker 3>He died of AIDS like somewhere.</v>

1766
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.040

<v Speaker 3>He died,</v>

1767
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 3>but I got to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when people were dying of AIDS.</v>

1768
01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Back back when AIDS will kill you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't even have medication for that.</v>

1772
01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Broke the Charlie Barnett influenced </v>
<v Speaker 3>dave and Dave would do that kind of </v>

1773
01:16:05.701 --> 01:16:06.810
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1774
01:16:06.811 --> 01:16:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Dave would just do standup in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>club.</v>

1775
01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:12.450
<v Speaker 3>He would just get and people just gather</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and watch him.</v>

1776
01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:14.250
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1777
01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never do that.</v>

1778
01:16:16.591 --> 01:16:21.591
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of detachment to be able to </v>

1779
01:16:21.591 --> 01:16:24.741
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be free in front of a crowd like </v>

1780
01:16:24.741 --> 01:16:25.230
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's powerful.</v>

1781
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:30.270
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've performed in all different types </v>

1782
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.270
<v Speaker 7>of really terrible places,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1783
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:34.531
<v Speaker 7>when you're coming up and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing open mics and bars and coffee </v>

1784
01:16:34.531 --> 01:16:37.891
<v Speaker 7>shops or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I still to this day roll my eyes </v>

1785
01:16:37.891 --> 01:16:40.981
<v Speaker 7>when someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an outdoor venue because it's just </v>

1786
01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:40.981
<v Speaker 7>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1787
01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:42.910
<v Speaker 7>there's nothing to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 7>So like the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1789
01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:47.590

<v Speaker 7>They just disappear into the ether.</v>

1790
01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.820
<v Speaker 7>And so the arenas too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you do stand up,</v>

1791
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.770
<v Speaker 7>not that performed in an arena.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's on my vision board though.</v>

1792

1808
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.580
<v Speaker 2>more basic than then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1809
01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I just want to a plane where if like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can fart freely and not have to worry </v>

1810
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:56.351
<v Speaker 2>about other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time I held a Fart from Cincinnati </v>

1811
01:17:56.351 --> 01:17:56.351
<v Speaker 2>to Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very polite of you.</v>

1812
01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>

1813
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:59.680
<v Speaker 2>on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are sneaky on.</v>

1814
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

1815
01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this to anybody and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>considerate person.</v>

1816
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:08.120
<v Speaker 2>If it was your plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him loose.</v>

1817
01:18:08.121 --> 01:18:10.790
<v Speaker 2>What if it was your plane and you had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stewardess still let it loose.</v>

1818

1819
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.640

<v Speaker 2>Because you can't change it to flight </v>

1820
01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.490
<v Speaker 2>attendant because they have a male </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight attendants because you can't call</v>

1821
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:24.491

<v Speaker 2>Do they really have male flight </v>

1822
01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:24.491

<v Speaker 2>Why did you get into it?</v>

1911
01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe my pain when I was a kid was </v>

1912
01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:34.071
<v Speaker 2>just feeling like I didn't fit in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there when you were telling me </v>

<v Speaker 2>Like that was my pain because I am black</v>

1914
01:22:35.671 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 2>and so I grew up feeling like I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fit in anywhere where you are at,</v>

1915
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.630

<v Speaker 2>My parents are black and someone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

<v Speaker 2>somewhere along the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's mixes,</v>

1919
01:22:48.991 --> 01:22:50.550
<v Speaker 2>there's black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>native American and there's white.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's no white people in this family.</v>

1922
01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:00.380
<v Speaker 2>If you saw my family be like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere along the lines to chimp at </v>

<v Speaker 7>but she had a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 7>childhood than me because no one ever </v>

1962
01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.211
<v Speaker 7>questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She never got her hair pulled by like </v>

1963
01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:44.211
<v Speaker 7>darker skin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>black girls.</v>

1964
01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:44.211
<v Speaker 7>Whereas I did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

1965
01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 7>Why did she not get her hair?</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's darker than me and her hair is </v>

1966
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:48.480
<v Speaker 7>kinkier so just she just came out </v>
<v Speaker 7>different.</v>

1967
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.080
<v Speaker 7>She came out brown.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>

1968
01:24:51.081 --> 01:24:52.560
<v Speaker 7>So we had to complete.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's where,</v>

1969
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:54.090
<v Speaker 7>that's where my pain came from.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>

1970
01:24:54.091 --> 01:24:56.610
<v Speaker 7>I felt like I didn't fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1971
01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.210
<v Speaker 7>so</v>

1972
01:24:57.450 --> 01:25:02.450
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your comedy is so sort of like you </v>

1973
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:04.620
<v Speaker 3>have like a personality that was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>compensating for not fitting in.</v>

1974
01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:06.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I started being funny because I,</v>

1975
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.270
<v Speaker 7>I felt like that could distract people </v>
<v Speaker 7>from,</v>

1976
01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:14.330
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I'll want them to like me and </v>

1977
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.330
<v Speaker 7>accept me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the one thing that everyone can agree</v>

1978
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:15.180
<v Speaker 7>on is that we like jokes and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 7>laughing.</v>

1979
01:25:15.181 --> 01:25:18.210
<v Speaker 7>So I became like a class clown and just </v>
<v Speaker 7>when I was like,</v>

1980
01:25:18.211 --> 01:25:23.211
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people like me now and I don't have to </v>

1981
01:25:23.211 --> 01:25:23.330
<v Speaker 7>worry about them wondering what I am </v>
<v Speaker 7>trying to put me in a box.</v>

1982
01:25:23.331 --> 01:25:24.780
<v Speaker 7>It's like I'm the funny one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's all the matter.</v>

1983
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:27.450
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

1984
01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:29.870
<v Speaker 7>But my pain is not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1985
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.470
<v Speaker 7>there's mild pain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a mile past.</v>

1986
01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:33.630
<v Speaker 7>That's exactly how he described it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cause a lot of comics were like,</v>

1987
01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:36.210
<v Speaker 7>oh it was molested by my father or </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody.</v>

1988
01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:36.720
<v Speaker 7>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1989
01:25:36.721 --> 01:25:38.640
<v Speaker 7>that's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry to hear that,</v>

1990
01:25:38.641 --> 01:25:43.641
<v Speaker 7>but that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But yet people always come to me and </v>

1991
01:25:43.641 --> 01:25:43.641
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have,</v>

1992
01:25:43.641 --> 01:25:44.520
<v Speaker 7>you're not addicted to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you know what I mean?</v>

1993
01:25:44.521 --> 01:25:47.220
<v Speaker 7>Vices and you weren't like touched by an</v>
<v Speaker 7>uncle.</v>

1994
01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.960
<v Speaker 7>So like why are you funny?</v>

1995
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:51.150
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

1996
01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.510
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I got plenty.</v>

1997
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.880
<v Speaker 3>It was mild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you first got on stage where </v>

1998
01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:58.880
<v Speaker 3>you work and what we do for a living?</v>

1999
01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.990
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2000
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:05.030
<v Speaker 7>first got on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did have a day job at that time I was </v>

2001
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 7>working.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

2002
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:08.570
<v Speaker 7>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've had a few jobs.</v>

2003
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:13.571
<v Speaker 7>At one point I was working at Sylvan </v>
<v Speaker 7>learning center and at one point I was </v>

2004
01:26:13.571 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 7>working at it or doing tutoring.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was a center director for a,</v>

2005
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:21.870
<v Speaker 7>at Sylvan learning center at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I was in charge of the facility just </v>

2006
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.130
<v Speaker 7>for like where I was in Glendale and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was also in Santa Clarita.</v>

2007
01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I wasn't,</v>

2008
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:32.290
<v Speaker 7>I was an assistant at the assistant </v>
<v Speaker 7>director at the Glendale and I was a </v>

2009
01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 7>full on center director at Santa </v>
<v Speaker 7>Clarita.</v>

2010
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:35.180
<v Speaker 7>But then after that I also worked at a </v>
<v Speaker 7>nail salon.</v>

2011
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:38.300
<v Speaker 7>I worked at a Vietnamese nail salon for </v>
<v Speaker 7>a minute.</v>

2012
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:40.330
<v Speaker 7>At the front desk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2013
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.580
<v Speaker 7>I worked in Toluca Lake Lake at a place </v>
<v Speaker 7>called oasis nail spa.</v>

2014
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:48.700
<v Speaker 7>Shout out to my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all my Vietnamese nail technicians who </v>

2015
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:48.700
<v Speaker 7>still work there.</v>

2016
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.900
<v Speaker 7>They were very nice and it's right next </v>
<v Speaker 7>to Bob's big boy.</v>

2017
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:56.470
<v Speaker 7>I used to work there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I actually met a lot of people working </v>

2018
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:59.141
<v Speaker 7>there because it's by the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like George Lopez would come in </v>

2019
01:26:59.141 --> 01:27:00.280
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>George Lopez was a little his whole.</v>

2020
01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:05.281
<v Speaker 7>Well when he was still married,</v>
<v Speaker 7>him and his wife and his daughter would </v>

2021
01:27:05.281 --> 01:27:05.281
<v Speaker 7>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2022
01:27:05.281 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 7>So this was before he would drop them </v>
<v Speaker 7>off.</v>

2023
01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.310
<v Speaker 7>I think that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2024
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.350
<v Speaker 7>But you know who did come and get his </v>
<v Speaker 7>nails done?</v>

2025
01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 7>David Allen greer with his.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His wife at the time.</v>

2026
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.970
<v Speaker 7>They have since split as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a bad luck salon.</v>

2027
01:27:14.971 --> 01:27:17.390
<v Speaker 7>Has everyone that comes in there is very</v>
<v Speaker 7>get divorced.</v>

2028
01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it has to do with a salon </v>
<v Speaker 3>or restaurant.</v>

2029
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:26.890
<v Speaker 7>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the hard tissue being in a </v>

2030
01:27:26.890 --> 01:27:26.890
<v Speaker 7>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You've managed to make it work.</v>

2031
01:27:26.890 --> 01:27:27.000
<v Speaker 7>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can make it work.</v>

2032
01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:28.710
<v Speaker 7>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it just takes like.</v>

2033
01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:31.350
<v Speaker 7>But also I think it's the type of people</v>
<v Speaker 7>you are two.</v>

2034
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:34.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One hundred percent or your parents</v>

2035
01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.440
<v Speaker 3>still together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My stepfather and my mother are still </v>

2036
01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.891
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been together since I was a </v>

2037
01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:43.891
<v Speaker 3>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

2038
01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a successful relationship.</v>

2039
01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one that started when I was </v>

2040
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:49.340
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's commitment,</v>

2041
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:49.460
<v Speaker 3>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.740
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very friendly.</v>

2043
01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:53.350
<v Speaker 3>They're very happy with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very friendly to each other.</v>

2044
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.840
<v Speaker 3>So I grew up around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were there.</v>

2045
01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:00.900
<v Speaker 3>They had a healthy relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw terrible relationship with my </v>

2046
01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:00.910
<v Speaker 3>mother and my father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

2047
01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Briefly violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

2048
01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Good.</v>

2049
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Then left that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when we moved in with my,</v>

2050
01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.400
<v Speaker 3>my mother's parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lived there for awhile and then we </v>

2051
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.570
<v Speaker 3>got an apartment after my mom had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2052
01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:17.470
<v Speaker 3>escape from my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2053
01:28:17.471 --> 01:28:19.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my mom met my Stepdad,</v>

2054
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:23.950
<v Speaker 3>it was a totally different relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a hippie and he was like,</v>

2055
01:28:23.951 --> 01:28:26.230

<v Speaker 3>He's into crystals and stuff.</v>

2056

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2057
01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:28.540
<v Speaker 3>he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was you.</v>

2058
01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:32.320
<v Speaker 3>He's an architect and he was just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different kind of guy.</v>

2059
01:28:32.321 --> 01:28:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Smoked Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had long hair.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just different kind of person.</v>

2061
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:37.550
<v Speaker 7>Do you ever wonder about like how you </v>
<v Speaker 7>would have like,</v>

2062
01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.560
<v Speaker 7>what your personnel would be like now if</v>
<v Speaker 7>your mom had stayed with your dad like </v>

2063
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:42.560
<v Speaker 7>longer?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:28:43.301 --> 01:28:44.920

<v Speaker 3>I would've,</v>

2066
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.840
<v Speaker 3>I would've been a dangerous person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't have a tendency towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence because I'm not a violent </v>

2071

2074
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:06.990

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2076
01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 3>It changed my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like having,</v>

2077
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I think for every boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially every boy that grew up,</v>

2078
01:29:12.851 --> 01:29:14.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2079
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 3>situations could have been way worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>than mine.</v>

2080
01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Mine wasn't the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody beat me.</v>

2081
01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't terrible in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get abused,</v>

2082
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 3>but I saw it and I saw a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw plenty of violence,</v>

2083
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:31.710
<v Speaker 3>so it's like I knew it was a thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I grew up around it,</v>

2084
01:29:31.711 --> 01:29:33.150
<v Speaker 3>it would eventually started to affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2085
01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:34.510
<v Speaker 3>And I would have been a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2086
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is you mirror that,</v>

2087
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guys who grow up with dads who </v>

2088
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:44.880
<v Speaker 3>beat their mom are way more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat their wives or their girlfriends or</v>

2089
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:45.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2090
01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:51.290
<v Speaker 3>or maybe the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe just hate it so much because </v>

2091
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:52.230
<v Speaker 3>you've seen it that you would never </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow it.</v>

2092
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2093
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I think for young men like having some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a vent something martial arts </v>

2094
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:06.560
<v Speaker 3>especially because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could actually get out the violence </v>

2095
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.100
<v Speaker 3>were you purge it from your system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to think about it anymore</v>

2096
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 3>as giant.</v>

2097
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 7>Is it really because I have no idea what</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like to be a man.</v>

2098
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.690
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>

2099
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.820
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think I do have a decent amount of </v>

2100
01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.571
<v Speaker 7>testosterone for a woman because I was a</v>
<v Speaker 7>tomboy when I was a little girl and I </v>

2101
01:30:23.571 --> 01:30:26.340
<v Speaker 7>was never into like dresses and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that when I was younger.</v>

2102
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:30.660
<v Speaker 7>I never like envision like getting </v>
<v Speaker 7>married and having this huge wedding.</v>

2103
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:32.490
<v Speaker 7>Those weren't my fantasies when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>kid,</v>

2104
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:33.990
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And whenever it was Halloween,</v>

2105
01:30:33.991 --> 01:30:38.991
<v Speaker 7>I would dress up as a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would be like Count Dracula and my </v>

2106
01:30:38.991 --> 01:30:39.510
<v Speaker 7>sister would be a princess and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 7>like the hulk.</v>

2107
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:46.370
<v Speaker 7>So I've always been kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've always gravitated towards a more </v>

2108
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:47.970
<v Speaker 7>masculine even doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very masculine thing to do.</v>

2109
01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.980
<v Speaker 7>And maybe that's why I tried gay dudes </v>
<v Speaker 7>too.</v>

2110
01:30:49.981 --> 01:30:51.960
<v Speaker 7>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's neither here nor there.</v>

2111
01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:57.890
<v Speaker 7>So is it like hard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like are you guys constantly fighting </v>

2112
01:30:57.890 --> 01:31:00.340
<v Speaker 7>the urge to be violent?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I don't know.</v>

2113
01:31:00.341 --> 01:31:00.610
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not</v>

2114
01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:03.970
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how I looked at it.</v>

2115
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:05.470
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of a weird way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at it,</v>

2116
01:31:05.471 --> 01:31:09.610
<v Speaker 3>but this is the way I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that every man,</v>

2117
01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:15.040
<v Speaker 3>every man who has a functional endocrine</v>
<v Speaker 3>system was testosterone,</v>

2118
01:31:15.041 --> 01:31:18.460
<v Speaker 3>has been involved in sports who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly athletic.</v>

2119
01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.180
<v Speaker 3>There's violence in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if your head was a house,</v>

2120
01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.680
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a room,</v>

2121
01:31:23.681 --> 01:31:25.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a violence room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

2122
01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 3>And you can open up that door there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That door gets opened.</v>

2123
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Crazy shit can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time that door's closed,</v>

2124
01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:35.020
<v Speaker 3>but the more fucked up things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in your life,</v>

2125
01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.800
<v Speaker 3>the more your house gets rocked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more your foundation gets fucked up,</v>

2126
01:31:38.801 --> 01:31:42.370
<v Speaker 3>the more your joy start to creak and </v>
<v Speaker 3>move left and right,</v>

2127
01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:47.080
<v Speaker 3>and things are off center and off plum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that door opens way easier.</v>

2128
01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:50.530
<v Speaker 3>That door is leaking that doors like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gaps.</v>

2129
01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Like the framing is not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2130
01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hinges are loose.</v>

2131
01:31:55.170 --> 01:32:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for someone who's been around a </v>

2132
01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:00.170
<v Speaker 3>lot of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people grew up in a neighborhoods,</v>

2133
01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 3>been involved in gang violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of shit.</v>

2134
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 3>That door is always ready to pop open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just always ready to open.</v>

2135
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Whereas someone who grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my friend todd,</v>

2136
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:12.180
<v Speaker 3>like one of the nicest guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super sweet guy,</v>

2137
01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 3>couldn't imagine a beating anybody up </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was loved.</v>

2138
01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe even too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's all love.</v>

2139
01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>So his door is locked up tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would need to get the key from his </v>

2140
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:23.150
<v Speaker 2>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna get in there.</v>

2141
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I have other friends where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2142
01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.860
<v Speaker 2>If you're brush up against that too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2143
01:32:27.861 --> 01:32:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Joey Diaz,</v>

2144
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2145
01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:36.410
<v Speaker 2>if you knock on that door when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking punch you in that violence ready</v>

2146
01:32:39.411 --> 01:32:44.411
<v Speaker 2>to go and he doesn't do much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it happens,</v>

2147
01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.500
<v Speaker 2>if the wrong thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that door comes swinging open,</v>

2148
01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't teach,</v>

2149
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't teach kids how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their emotions properly.</v>

2150
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:56.450
<v Speaker 2>And did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Mr Rogers documentary?</v>

2151
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:56.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2152
01:32:58.070 --> 01:33:00.140
<v Speaker 2>So there's only so many things you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

2153
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:05.200

<v Speaker 2>What was the last time a girl ran a </v>

<v Speaker 2>By the way?</v>

2161

<v Speaker 2>It might be the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2162
01:33:28.210 --> 01:33:28.370
<v Speaker 2>that noble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chick who was,</v>

2163

<v Speaker 2>But she was running stuff while she was </v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what he was called after A.</v>

2173
01:33:58.511 --> 01:34:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Beard and you have to drive around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bentleys,</v>

2174
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Rolls Royces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what was crazy.</v>

2175
01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.520
<v Speaker 2>These luxurious cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you need.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's piss poor choices.</v>

2177
01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:13.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that at the time.</v>

2178
01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you say?</v>

2179
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Try Mercedes or Rolls Royce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something different.</v>

2180
01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:22.130
<v Speaker 2>It's very vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my question is like,</v>

2181
01:34:22.131 --> 01:34:22.900
<v Speaker 2>do these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2182
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:27.970
<v Speaker 2>when you're going into a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they know it's a cult or do they </v>

2183
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:29.480
<v Speaker 2>think it's literally like a legit </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious organization that they're just</v>

2184
01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:30.050
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They</v>

2185
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:32.690
<v Speaker 3>think it's a legit movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2186
01:34:32.691 --> 01:34:33.890
<v Speaker 3>like what is a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2187
01:34:33.891 --> 01:34:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Because Christianity has often led by </v>
<v Speaker 3>scholars refer to as a cult.</v>

2188
01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:42.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain documentaries on </v>

2189
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Christianity that refer to is a cult of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

2190
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Like go what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cult is a group of people that follow </v>

2191
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 3>an ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They follow a certain way in pattern of </v>

2192
01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:53.441
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people are doing that exact </v>

2193
01:34:53.441 --> 01:34:56.180
<v Speaker 3>same thing until someone from like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking FBI starts calling it a cult.</v>

2194
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.530
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't</v>

2195
01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a red flag would be is if like,</v>

2196
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:06.500
<v Speaker 2>because you know though is if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader is fucking,</v>

2197
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that to me is a red flag because if</v>

2198
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:16.421
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at religious organizations </v>

2199
01:35:16.421 --> 01:35:18.970
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the one thing that's frowned upon </v>

2200
01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:21.281
<v Speaker 2>and like all of them is like too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex or any sex really any type of like </v>

2201
01:35:21.281 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 2>promiscuity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2202
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:24.740
<v Speaker 2>and that's a car I think across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>board with religions just in general.</v>

2203
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 2>None of them were like this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2204
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:31.811
<v Speaker 2>you should have sex to procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like that's it with the person that </v>

2205
01:35:31.811 --> 01:35:31.811
<v Speaker 2>you're married to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with that they were,</v>

2206
01:35:31.811 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 2>they were like this group sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think we might be in the cult,</v>

2207
01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge red flag.</v>

2208
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:40.520
<v Speaker 2>As soon as the dude starts fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's watching and you're like,</v>

2209
01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:42.290
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we get so fucked?</v>

2211
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:52.670
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't trust that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the thing though.</v>

2212
01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:56.840
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing with men like men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get into power,</v>

2213
01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:02.140
<v Speaker 2>anytime a man runs a giant organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has all these followers and he gets to </v>

<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2312
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.060
<v Speaker 2>You remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was</v>

2313
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.330
<v Speaker 3>just going to say they're not doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2314
01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met,</v>

2315
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came to UFC.</v>

2316
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave did.</v>

2317
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Didn't get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made like a million dollars off.</v>

2318
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 3>That song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made some money.</v>

2319
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 3>He made some money and Dana white </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought them to a UFC.</v>

2320
01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Is this because he was gay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2321
01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 3>And then then went to church and said he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't gay anymore.</v>

2322
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:20.670
<v Speaker 3>He was ashamed of being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very sad because he was saying </v>

2323
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:20.670
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2324
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:21.780
<v Speaker 3>he was ashamed of being gay in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2325
01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.970
<v Speaker 3>the church was going to say we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pray the gay away.</v>

2326
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.060
<v Speaker 3>It's one of them deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a.</v>

2327
01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.150
<v Speaker 3>That to me makes me so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

2328
01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:34.230
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with being gay </v>

2329
01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:34.230
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

2330
01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:36.490
<v Speaker 3>this idea that you could change someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>from being gay,</v>

2331
01:41:36.491 --> 01:41:37.880
<v Speaker 3>so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2332
01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:38.940
<v Speaker 3>just be gay.</v>

2333
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 3>You're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all right.</v>

2334
01:41:40.690 --> 01:41:45.690
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just need better people around you </v>

2350
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:19.090
<v Speaker 3>it's just a giant burden.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Relieved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relieved off my back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2354
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:29.520

<v Speaker 3>the stigma is so it's,</v>

2355
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:32.620
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bad for gay people.</v>

2356
01:42:32.621 --> 01:42:36.130
<v Speaker 3>It's bad for straight people because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even bad for people were homophobes</v>

2357
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.260
<v Speaker 3>because they don't realize how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are really gay.</v>

2358
01:42:38.710 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 3>And if they did they would probably be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2359
01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:42.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is normal.</v>

01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>

2418
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:15.980
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she talks to you like that.</v>

2419
01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:16.670
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2420
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm in charge of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2421
01:45:18.741 --> 01:45:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't walk around my dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk through them.</v>

2422
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.400
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Alpha.</v>

2423
01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't get to get on top of me.</v>

2424
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 3>They don't climb on top of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't kiss my face.</v>

2425
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:30.050
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my bed.</v>

2426
01:45:30.150 --> 01:45:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:32.310
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2428
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:34.670
<v Speaker 3>But I know so many people think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird because I wouldn't want my dog and</v>

2429
01:45:34.671 --> 01:45:35.010
<v Speaker 3>my bags.</v>

2430
01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Whitney's dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She loves pits.</v>

2431
01:45:38.370 --> 01:45:43.310
<v Speaker 3>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's adorable.</v>

2432
01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a cute little tiny one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that little one?</v>

2433
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:49.970
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2434
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bulldog.</v>

2435
01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2436
01:45:53.331 --> 01:45:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I like bulldogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like French bulldogs.</v>

2437
01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also one of those ones that like</v>

2438
01:45:58.191 --> 01:46:00.530
<v Speaker 3>those little tiny ones that probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>annoy you.</v>

2439
01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:03.470
<v Speaker 3>I like little dogs to you and like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>keys.</v>

2440
01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.690
<v Speaker 3>I like 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Pomeranians,</v>

2441
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:10.680
<v Speaker 3>like dogs in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only dogs I feel bad for.</v>

2442
01:46:10.681 --> 01:46:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Or those bulldogs with those fat faces </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't walk and they can't breathe.</v>

2443
01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Pugs are like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have nasal problems.</v>

2444
01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:19.970
<v Speaker 3>They're so cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck.</v>

2445
01:46:19.971 --> 01:46:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Did you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:22.430
<v Speaker 3>They looked like I got punched in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

2447
01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 3>but they're so cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's depressing.</v>

2448
01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.640
<v Speaker 3>It's from all the breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2449
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that how they got like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Well they've made them that way on </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose because they want their face to </v>

2451
01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.630
<v Speaker 3>be flattened out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've bred to that characteristic,</v>

2452
01:46:34.290 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2453
01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Good dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get them in Kansas and I'm not getting </v>

2454
01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:45.371
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more realistic for me than getting a </v>

2455
01:46:45.371 --> 01:46:49.631
<v Speaker 3>band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a dog and then you have a man and </v>

2456
01:46:49.631 --> 01:46:49.631
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is one.</v>

2457
01:46:49.631 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Too many things are going to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dog would kill the man</v>

2458
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:55.100
<v Speaker 2>for 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
