00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.400
<v Speaker 1>but I know that it's,</v>

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>especially the border towns,</v>

6
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>they're incredibly dangerous.</v>

7
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just people going down left and right.</v>

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Getting headless and fucking body pack.</v>

9
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It was safe before safe.</v>

10
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting when a culture like drastically changes over a fairly short</v>

11
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

12

<v Speaker 1>I used to go to Mexico and we just go to the spring break thing on TV in like</v>

13
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>the late nineties you know,</v>

14
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.163
<v Speaker 1>maybe like two,</v>

15
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe even the early two thousands it was like no big deal.</v>

16
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.304
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.480
