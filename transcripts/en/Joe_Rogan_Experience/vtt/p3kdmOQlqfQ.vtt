00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>It's over</v>

36
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Kroger.</v>

37
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>

38
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 3>This is all I have.</v>

39
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 3>All I have is a fake smile and an opener wrote something.</v>

40
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.231
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

41
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

42
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 3>this is a text I sent to you last week when I was at,</v>

43
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I thought the worst day of my life until today.</v>

44
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 3>And I came to town to try to organize this and I don't know what the fuck,</v>

45
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't live stream.</v>

46
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.024
<v Speaker 3>What does it,</v>

47
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 3>you have a car.</v>

48
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 3>So this is what I sent to Rogan at the depths</v>

49
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 3>of what I thought was the worst hangover ever.</v>

50
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.641
<v Speaker 1>We're all adults,</v>

51
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:52.971
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

52
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:53.840
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

53
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Even even worrying about this is both</v>

54
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>with cotton candy here.</v>

55
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 3>This is what I wrote to rogue in a week ago.</v>

56
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I get a date right there and hit that bill.</v>

57
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a lot of shit.</v>

58
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.063
<v Speaker 3>A little cool.</v>

59
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a serious panic mode and really want to bail on it.</v>

60
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Meaning this,</v>

61
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great idea,</v>

62
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 3>but I have no idea how to organize it and it's so close.</v>

63
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 3>The comedy store gave us the day and I don't want to fuck them over,</v>

64
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how to make this work.</v>

65
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up and don't know how to put it together.</v>

66
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to put all this on you,</v>

67
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to be the guy responsible for an abortion,</v>

68
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 3>but way far only you and a vague bill burr have committed.</v>

69
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I want to fake a stroke to get out of ruining.</v>

70
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 3>It saved me.</v>

71
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Ps has been a long week.</v>

72
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.263
<v Speaker 2>Rogan,</v>

73
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.363
<v Speaker 2>Rogan,</v>

74
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>very succinctly</v>

75
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 4>rights back.</v>

76
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 5>We'll figure it.</v>

77
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck man.</v>

78
00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:05.024
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

79
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.990
<v Speaker 5>I'll handle it.</v>

80
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.740
<v Speaker 5>Don't sweat it.</v>

81
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.521
<v Speaker 5>It's nothing.</v>

82
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.480
<v Speaker 5>We show up.</v>

83
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.380
<v Speaker 5>We drank.</v>

84
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.180
<v Speaker 5>I smoked pot pot.</v>

85
00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.620
<v Speaker 5>We talk easy.</v>

86
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

87
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 4>fucking Rogan says it's good.</v>

88
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.714
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

89
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Made it road on the man show.</v>

90
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.113
<v Speaker 5>Get two guys.</v>

91
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.591
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

92
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 5>Do you still get hate mail from them?</v>

93
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

94
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.880
<v Speaker 5>The writers,</v>

95
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.531
<v Speaker 5>no one's no,</v>

96
00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 5>but I can say there was a,</v>

97
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.680
<v Speaker 5>there was very little preparation and a,</v>

98
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 5>and there was some funny fucking monologues that were on that show.</v>

99
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.133
<v Speaker 5>We had some fun.</v>

100
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

101
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 5>you don't need preparation then sometimes you do like right now.</v>

102
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.341
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

103
00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:47.091
<v Speaker 4>I had that.</v>

104
00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 4>I had that</v>

105
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.191
<v Speaker 6>fill that out.</v>

106
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.024
<v Speaker 6>That weird.</v>

107
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.590
<v Speaker 6>I like the Doug always.</v>

108
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be the guy responsible for an abortion,</v>

109
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.680
<v Speaker 6>but he's totally had abortions that he's paid for her</v>

110
00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.961
<v Speaker 6>for Christ.</v>

111
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:00.860
<v Speaker 6>You're bringing it down.</v>

112
00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 6>Plus when Donald Trump becomes president,</v>

113
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.610
<v Speaker 6>you're a fucking criminal portion.</v>

114
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 6>Draws it at eight for a plethora of abortions.</v>

115
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.481
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

116
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 4>if you thought this was going to be about the election,</v>

117
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.673
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

118
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 4>it's the end of the world.</v>

119
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Either way.</v>

120
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

121
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.650
<v Speaker 4>If you guys,</v>

122
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.483
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't pay here.</v>

123
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.921
<v Speaker 4>I do have to.</v>

124
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 4>I have to do this.</v>

125
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Brent Ericson Ericson.</v>

126
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 4>We do have our breaking news guy,</v>

127
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Brent Ericson.</v>

128
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Fantastic comic is actually having to watch the CNN coverage.</v>

129
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 4>So anything actually does matter.</v>

130
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 4>He'll run out and be breaking.</v>

131
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 4>He has a laptop.</v>

132
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

133
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 4>kind of lyrics and he's watching it.</v>

134
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.593
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

135
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 4>We can just do four hours before the shows.</v>

136
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 4>I do you have any TV screens?</v>

137
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Are there any laptops?</v>

138
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 4>What are we going to do out there?</v>

139
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Very hasty.</v>

140
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 4>Hastily thrown together yet planned for months.</v>

141
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 4>You texted me about this easily in August,</v>

142
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.733
<v Speaker 4>easily</v>

143
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.511
<v Speaker 6>a year ago.</v>

144
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:17.344
<v Speaker 6>He came up with it.</v>

145
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.083
<v Speaker 6>I realized,</v>

146
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

147
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 6>I think everyone doesn't like me.</v>

148
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 6>When you returned my texts,</v>

149
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 6>they were scared that girl.</v>

150

<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter if you care about does it Kinda does.</v>

159
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 6>What matters the most is that no matter who wins,</v>

00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 6>A guy couldn't form full sentences,</v>

171
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.600
<v Speaker 6>went to actual schools.</v>

172
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.190
<v Speaker 4>That's very racial,</v>

173
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 4>very articulate</v>

174
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.880

<v Speaker 7>That's how I look.</v>

177
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.401
<v Speaker 7>We were happy.</v>

178
00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:04.620
<v Speaker 7>We're having them look at this really articulate,</v>

179
00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:06.210
<v Speaker 7>intelligent guy that's reasonable.</v>

180
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.890
<v Speaker 7>What he does on election day.</v>

181
00:06:07.891 --> 00:06:09.390
<v Speaker 7>It's your tradition not making this up.</v>

182
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.580
<v Speaker 7>He plays basketball on election day.</v>

183
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.721
<v Speaker 7>Good for him.</v>

184
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:14.010
<v Speaker 7>I heard that on CNN today.</v>

185
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 7>That's why I talk shows actually have screeners and go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] you have an interesting story about,</v>

190
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Speaker 4>you could be like Byron Allen on that late night show</v>

191
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.151
<v Speaker 4>going to the zoo.</v>

192
00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:32.500
<v Speaker 4>Completely different.</v>

193
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Bill Furry like to water ski.</v>

195
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:38.950
<v Speaker 4>You brought that up and here's my anecdote.</v>

196
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.110
<v Speaker 4>That fits perfectly right before the commercial.</v>

197
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Don't forget to segway to Kreischer with something completely</v>

198
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.921
<v Speaker 7>different.</v>

199
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 7>Friday night for Chrysler in the machine on showtime.</v>

200
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.233

00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.580
<v Speaker 4>so get some Nachos.</v>

204
00:06:58.581 --> 00:06:59.414

205
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 4>They squeezed that by hand.</v>

206
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 4>That sauce.</v>

207
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 7>I feel about Nachos at the comedy store the same way I feel about whoever the</v>

<v Speaker 4>Press real younger.</v>

214
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.720
<v Speaker 4>If the president really affects your life,</v>

215
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 7>you've made poor choices or you met him.</v>

216
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 7>What if you met that Guy Jon Stewart thing?</v>

217
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 7>50 years old.</v>

218
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 7>But you see the Jon Stewart thing,</v>

219
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 7>your muscles don't know it.</v>

220
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 7>Jon Stewart,</v>

221
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 7>Jon Stewart,</v>

224
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 7>he had with Donald Trump.</v>

225
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 7>It's like in his ass now.</v>

226
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

227
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 7>And Donald Trump's tweets him at one 30 in the morning.</v>

228
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 7>Little Jon Stewart is a pussy and we'll be hopeless in a debate with me.</v>

229
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 7>And he's a liar because he changed his name.</v>

230
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.511
<v Speaker 7>That would go,</v>

231
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 7>that's the best joke.</v>

232
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 7>Cause he goes,</v>

233
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 7>his real name's Jon Stewart or his real name is John [inaudible] and Burger</v>

234

<v Speaker 7>Liebowitz Chin.</v>

236
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 7>And then Jon Stewart wrote back,</v>

237
00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 7>John Jay,</v>

238

<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

<v Speaker 7>And Donald Trump's real name is fuck face bond sticker with by clowns.</v>

240
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 7>Stick mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Pick camp heritage.</v>

244
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.510
<v Speaker 7>And at the end of it,</v>

245
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 7>one 30 in the morning,</v>

246
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 7>Trump tweets him at one 30 in the morning.</v>

247
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 7>Little Jon Stewart is a pussy</v>

248
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 7>and we'd be hopeless in a debate with me.</v>

249
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't even</v>

254
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 4>That means he was walking around talking to himself.</v>

255
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.691

<v Speaker 7>giant fish place down in the Cape and your sound system on stage was connected</v>

633
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 10>You're not comfortable with what we're doing.</v>

634
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 10>Trump's Trump's winning New Hampshire.</v>

635
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 10>Hillary's winning Virginia.</v>

643
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.340
<v Speaker 10>I don't want that on.</v>

644
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.031
<v Speaker 10>Why is it illegal?</v>

645
00:21:32.031 --> 00:21:32.930
<v Speaker 10>What's illegal about this?</v>

646
00:21:32.931 --> 00:21:35.970
<v Speaker 10>Having a baby on stage while people are drinking booze and smoking pot.</v>

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.150
<v Speaker 5>You should never have one fucking person.</v>

772
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.900
<v Speaker 5>nobody should want that fucking position.</v>

1088
00:34:42.641 --> 00:34:42.851
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

1089
00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:43.151
<v Speaker 11>And I'm like,</v>

1090
00:34:43.151 --> 00:34:44.410
<v Speaker 11>when I just pick three,</v>

1091
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.120
<v Speaker 11>it just stick with that.</v>

1092
00:34:46.121 --> 00:34:46.461

1094
00:34:46.631 --> 00:34:47.321
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to change it.</v>

1095
00:34:47.321 --> 00:34:48.670
<v Speaker 11>Then all of a sudden they send me an email.</v>

1096
00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:48.911
<v Speaker 11>They go,</v>

1097

1099
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.163
<v Speaker 11>But if you want it,</v>

<v Speaker 11>go fuck yourself.</v>

1104
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.700
<v Speaker 11>I'm not doing that.</v>

1105
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.410
<v Speaker 11>So for like a week I couldn't do it.</v>

1106
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:03.850
<v Speaker 11>And then after like 10 days,</v>

1107
00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:05.950
<v Speaker 11>it was cool to be back on it again cause it kind of like,</v>

1108
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.120
<v Speaker 11>oh he's not coming back.</v>

1109
00:35:07.121 --> 00:35:07.221
<v Speaker 11>We,</v>

1110
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:08.054
<v Speaker 11>we need them,</v>

1111
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:09.640
<v Speaker 11>we need them.</v>

1112
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.360
<v Speaker 11>So we clicked on revenue and top 10 were celebrity boob jobs.</v>

1113
00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.620
<v Speaker 11>So we make our money.</v>

1114
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.660
<v Speaker 11>How come they needed a 10 days ago,</v>

1115
00:35:16.661 --> 00:35:16.841
<v Speaker 11>Joe?</v>

1116
00:35:16.841 --> 00:35:17.980
<v Speaker 11>And all of a sudden they don't need it now.</v>

1117
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.090
<v Speaker 11>And I'm on Facebook again.</v>

1118
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 11>Why is that</v>

1119
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 6>point as well?</v>

1120
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 6>You're making some great points.</v>

1121
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.731
<v Speaker 11>I am.</v>

1122
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 11>I'm making tremendous points and I hear the sarcasm in your voice.</v>

1123
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.503
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

1124
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:27.463
<v Speaker 11>no.</v>

1125
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.490
<v Speaker 11>He goes down.</v>

1126
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.220
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

1127
00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.620
<v Speaker 11>me smokes a little fucking weed and all of a sudden I'm,</v>

1128
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.550
<v Speaker 11>I'm the Moron in the rock.</v>

1129
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.930
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

1130
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:41.511
<v Speaker 5>I haven't said that.</v>

1131
00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:42.950
<v Speaker 5>I still need that shoulder workout.</v>

1132
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.833
<v Speaker 5>You don't telling me about him?</v>

1133
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.110
<v Speaker 5>I worry about the fingerprint thing.</v>

1134
00:35:48.111 --> 00:35:48.740
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

1135
00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.190
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

1136
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.300
<v Speaker 5>You put Gary Johnson,</v>

1137
00:35:50.301 --> 00:35:51.650
<v Speaker 5>just one Puerto Rico.</v>

1138
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.023
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1139
00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:58.520
<v Speaker 5>Powerful.</v>

1140
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.353
<v Speaker 5>Puerto Rico.</v>

1141
00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.200
<v Speaker 5>Puerto Rico is like one strange child that you had with your mistress,</v>

1142
00:36:03.201 --> 00:36:04.490
<v Speaker 5>so you don't really like to talk about,</v>

1143
00:36:04.491 --> 00:36:05.330
<v Speaker 5>but you give them money.</v>

1144
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.061
<v Speaker 5>They're not really,</v>

1145
00:36:08.061 --> 00:36:10.700
<v Speaker 5>it's more like a beautiful child that we have hidden the attic.</v>

1146
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 5>Well that's,</v>

1147
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.860
<v Speaker 5>that's probably a better description you're writing,</v>

1148
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.330
<v Speaker 5>but they're not really a state,</v>

1149
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1150
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:18.320
<v Speaker 5>They both,</v>

1151
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.430
<v Speaker 5>they're a part of the United States.</v>

1152
00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.360
<v Speaker 5>People that were enjoying their lives and then we showed up I think is what</v>

1153
00:36:23.361 --> 00:36:24.194
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

1154
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.260
<v Speaker 5>but there and shit.</v>

1155
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they want to be a state.</v>

1156
00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.013
<v Speaker 5>No idea.</v>

1157
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:30.590
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

1158
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:30.820
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

1159
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.790
<v Speaker 5>Look at Pico,</v>

1161
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.920
<v Speaker 5>but it's one of those weird ones like Guam where you're like,</v>

1162
00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:34.401
<v Speaker 5>what's going on?</v>

1163
00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:35.234
<v Speaker 5>Aware where,</v>

1164
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.823
<v Speaker 5>who owns this?</v>

1165

<v Speaker 13>I think I took this too late.</v>

1309
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 13>I'm going to walk down.</v>

1310
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 13>I'm busting Manson's balls like,</v>

1311
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:21.941
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

1312
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 13>it's a block away.</v>

1313
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 13>We can just walk like fucking men.</v>

1314
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.751
<v Speaker 13>I'm manning up.</v>

1315
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:30.751
<v Speaker 13>I'm putting on a fake comedy face to do this shit under extreme circumstances.</v>

1316
00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:36.031
<v Speaker 13>You can walk down here and I know he's going to get on stage and you know it's</v>

1317
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:38.190
<v Speaker 13>going to be on stage.</v>

1318
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.060
<v Speaker 13>You think it's happening.</v>

1319
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.810
<v Speaker 13>I can go on and on and on,</v>

1320
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:48.490
<v Speaker 13>but it's going to be funny because I thought the dynamic of Manson and Rogan,</v>

1321
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.890
<v Speaker 13>you'd be so treacherous.</v>

1322
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.571
<v Speaker 11>It was.</v>

1323
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 11>It was.</v>

1324
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.710
<v Speaker 11>It was.</v>

1325
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.020
<v Speaker 11>It was alarmingly like,</v>

1326
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.500
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.970
<v Speaker 11>like almost like a high school reunion.</v>

1328
00:41:58.971 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 11>Joseph's while somebody goes,</v>

1386
00:43:41.551 --> 00:43:46.551
<v Speaker 13>We were talking about this earlier when when you feel the heat coming off of you</v>

1387
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.370
<v Speaker 13>and you just think that's your imagination and then you put your sunglasses on</v>

1388
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:54.780
<v Speaker 13>and they fog up.</v>

1394
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.470
<v Speaker 13>I didn't know what I was talking about.</v>

1395
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.180

<v Speaker 11>It went great.</v>

1397
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:16.860
<v Speaker 11>I remember saying,</v>

<v Speaker 11>I never realized what a bundle of nerves you are.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1521
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 7>if you'd have really voted for the winter,</v>

1522
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:02.290
<v Speaker 7>you would have voted for Gore the first time.</v>

1523
00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:03.981
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1526
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.850
<v Speaker 6>That's the only time I didn't vote and I was on a TV show,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the x show,</v>

1528
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.640
<v Speaker 6>and I said out loud on this TV.</v>

1529
00:48:11.641 --> 00:48:12.031
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1530
00:48:12.031 --> 00:48:12.990
<v Speaker 6>my vote doesn't count.</v>

1531
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:13.883
<v Speaker 6>I'm not voting.</v>

1532
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.750
<v Speaker 6>Everyone don't vote besides,</v>

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.070
<v Speaker 6>you ruined the future that is now</v>

1538
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:34.290
<v Speaker 7>Al Gore won by a half a million votes in the popular vote.</v>

1539
00:48:34.291 --> 00:48:35.730
<v Speaker 7>That's how you know the system's broken.</v>

1540
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.770
<v Speaker 7>That's how a lot of fucking people,</v>

1541
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.320
<v Speaker 7>a half a million people die in a fire.</v>

1542
00:48:40.321 --> 00:48:43.940
<v Speaker 7>And it's the worst tragedy in American history people.</v>

1543
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:45.343
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1545
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.240
<v Speaker 7>But at half a million,</v>

1548
00:48:57.361 --> 00:49:01.620
<v Speaker 7>your patch of dirt is more significant than you as an individual and us as a</v>

1549
00:49:01.621 --> 00:49:03.000
<v Speaker 7>collective that can share ideas.</v>

1550
00:49:03.001 --> 00:49:05.760
<v Speaker 7>It's more important to have fucking electoral college bill burr.</v>

<v Speaker 11>I told him to get me a hotel and I was like,</v>

1723
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:11.463
<v Speaker 11>you could do that.</v>

1731
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:30.380
<v Speaker 11>because they know what did Ralphie break that bed?</v>

1973
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 7>I wrote a blog and I was mocking something that someone did that was ridiculous.</v>

1974
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 7>Like some guy who grew his fingernails or the longest in the world and he lost</v>

1975
01:01:48.441 --> 01:01:50.060
<v Speaker 7>control of his left arm.</v>

1976
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:54.290
<v Speaker 7>Like his nerves died in his left arm because he has these fingernails that are</v>

1977
01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:56.660
<v Speaker 7>like seven feet long and he never cuts them.</v>

1978
01:01:56.661 --> 01:02:00.650
<v Speaker 7>And I wrote this whole thing about it and this guy emailed me back about body</v>

1983
01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.160

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:09.610
<v Speaker 7>they want to be a sponsor on your potty.</v>

1993
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:26.280
<v Speaker 7>screwed into the top of their head and cut in their ears and split and their</v>

1994
01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:30.530

<v Speaker 7>dick in his balls anymore.</v>

1997
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 7>He had some weird relationship with his boyfriend was boyfriends like that Dick</v>

1998
01:02:39.661 --> 01:02:40.351
<v Speaker 7>is useless.</v>

1999
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.310
<v Speaker 7>You're going to cut it off.</v>

2000
01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:41.641
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

2001
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:41.881
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

<v Speaker 7>master,</v>

2003
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.600
<v Speaker 7>and he's this guy ties rubber bands around his dick until there's no circulation</v>

2004
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 7>in his dick and balls.</v>

2005
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 7>It all goes black.</v>

<v Speaker 7>needs a rubber band and not have circulation in their penis.</v>

2008

<v Speaker 10>it's a cell death.</v>

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:35.870
<v Speaker 3>What do you think I was picking on?</v>

2326
01:12:35.871 --> 01:12:36.704

<v Speaker 4>Trump.</v>

2335
01:12:47.351 --> 01:12:48.184
<v Speaker 4>Trump.</v>

01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:50.530

01:12:50.531 --> 01:12:51.040
<v Speaker 4>Thanks man.</v>

2338
01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.240
<v Speaker 4>I bought it downtown.</v>

2339
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:53.120
<v Speaker 4>Sweet.</v>

2340
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.953

<v Speaker 4>A hundred bucks suits downtown baby Brendan Walsh.</v>

2342
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen can't tell the difference either.</v>

2343
01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:04.450
<v Speaker 4>You cannot tell the difference between a hundred dollars suit and $1,000 to</v>

2344
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 4>tell.</v>

2345
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:05.141
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2346
01:13:05.141 --> 01:13:06.700
<v Speaker 4>I'd never owned $1,000 suit,</v>

2347
01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:08.283
<v Speaker 4>but you've seen him.</v>

2348
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.131
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him.</v>

2349
01:13:09.131 --> 01:13:09.281
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2350
01:13:09.281 --> 01:13:09.701
<v Speaker 4>you go.</v>

2351
01:13:09.701 --> 01:13:11.710
<v Speaker 4>Do you watch prosecuting attorneys?</v>

2352
01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:12.251
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

2353
01:13:12.251 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

2354
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.970
<v Speaker 4>the defense attorneys are the ones with the fucking expensive suits.</v>

2355
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.320
<v Speaker 3>See The da down at the store buying $100 suit.</v>

2356
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:24.900
<v Speaker 3>What's your predictions?</v>

2357
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.701
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking,</v>

2358
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:27.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2359
01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:28.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for comedy,</v>

2360
01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.170
<v Speaker 4>but this is too funny the way it's going.</v>

2361
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.221
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny.</v>

2362
01:13:34.221 --> 01:13:34.940
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>

2363
01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.650
<v Speaker 4>This is fucking riveting.</v>

2364
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.513
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the,</v>

2365
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:38.583
<v Speaker 4>this is tremendous.</v>

2366
01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:41.110
<v Speaker 16>Amazing is that on top of all the drama,</v>

2367
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.810
<v Speaker 16>everybody in California just got really fucking high.</v>

2368
01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.070
<v Speaker 4>They're all stone and watching it right now,</v>

2369
01:13:48.071 --> 01:13:49.210
<v Speaker 4>like this is it.</v>

2370
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:49.721
<v Speaker 7>Finally.</v>

2371
01:13:49.721 --> 01:13:52.480
<v Speaker 7>We don't have to feel like we're fucking criminals for doing something that</v>

2372
01:13:52.481 --> 01:13:53.500
<v Speaker 7>doesn't even hurt you.</v>

2373
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:55.170
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>

2374
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 4>That leads to heroin and fucking other things.</v>

2375
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.160
<v Speaker 7>Best Gateway drug for me is alcohol.</v>

2376
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:09.000
<v Speaker 16>I wonder if they're going to smoke weed in pornos while not wearing condoms.</v>

2377
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno if the condom thing has passed has</v>

2378
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:12.281
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2379
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:12.800
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>

2380
01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.633
<v Speaker 5>that's a good joke.</v>

2381
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Is it weird if on the condom thing I wrote in Gary Johnson</v>

2382
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 5>didn't really get an answer there.</v>

2383
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 5>I guess instead of instead of using condoms,</v>

2384
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 5>you have to use Johnson weld.</v>

2385
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:35.380
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like some kind of Dick Repair Kit doesn't it?</v>

2386
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:43.760
<v Speaker 5>Five seconds after what happened?</v>

2387
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Who did you drop the trap?</v>

2388
01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:47.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2389
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.490
<v Speaker 5>how dare you there.</v>

2390
01:14:48.491 --> 01:14:48.881
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

2391
01:14:48.881 --> 01:14:49.271
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

2392
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:49.571
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

2393
01:14:49.571 --> 01:14:49.931
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

2394
01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:50.321

2395
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

2401
01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:55.480
<v Speaker 5>Just to recap.</v>

2408
01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Too early to call and other than that,</v>

2409
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:07.150
<v Speaker 5>everything else is mustard color.</v>

2410
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.170
<v Speaker 5>I feel like this was frozen.</v>

2411
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.601

<v Speaker 5>It's been frozen for three hours.</v>

2418
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:24.521
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2419
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:27.060
<v Speaker 5>Wolf Blitzer is really thinking about this point.</v>

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:18.601
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2454
01:16:18.601 --> 01:16:21.600
<v Speaker 5>this is shattering my world because I'm such a conspiracy nut.</v>

2455
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:23.850
<v Speaker 5>I just thought like they got fucking,</v>

2456
01:16:23.851 --> 01:16:24.660
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:24.781
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2458
01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:26.100
<v Speaker 5>they want Hillary to be president,</v>

2459
01:16:26.101 --> 01:16:29.100
<v Speaker 5>so they got the craziest fucking monster to run against her and now my whole</v>

2460
01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:33.900
<v Speaker 5>world's being shattered because it looked like I've been wrong all these years,</v>

2461
01:16:33.901 --> 01:16:34.291
<v Speaker 5>that it's,</v>

2462
01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:36.660
<v Speaker 5>the elections aren't fucking rig from top to bottom.</v>

2463
01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:38.123
<v Speaker 5>I think they,</v>

2464
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:40.170
<v Speaker 5>they rig it to a certain extent,</v>

2465
01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:42.840
<v Speaker 5>but there's only so much they could do without being really obvious.</v>

2466
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.520
<v Speaker 5>Mean you can have.</v>

2467
01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.190
<v Speaker 5>because there's a bunch of people that want to run it all.</v>

2469
01:16:47.191 --> 01:16:47.880
<v Speaker 5>They just can't get up,</v>

<v Speaker 5>get on the same page.</v>

2472
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.680
<v Speaker 5>Trumps the one that said it was rigged and now he's about to win this shit.</v>

2473
01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:53.710

<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

2475
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:59.130
<v Speaker 5>But he kind of proved it was along the way along with wikileaks exposing what</v>

2476
01:16:59.131 --> 01:16:59.641
<v Speaker 5>they did,</v>

01:17:07.771 --> 01:17:08.100
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

3034
01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:29.021
<v Speaker 13>conspiracy theories because a million years ago it was Viet VHS.</v>

3035
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 13>Rogan was showing a no,</v>

3036
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:33.350
<v Speaker 13>we faked the moon landing.</v>

<v Speaker 11>Behold a pale horse.</v>

3041
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:40.650

3043
01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.170
<v Speaker 11>came from,</v>

3047
01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 13>later in years,</v>

3048
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:52.670
<v Speaker 13>but it was him.</v>

3049
01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:57.030
<v Speaker 13>That was the first conspiracy guy about the moon landing and he's [inaudible]</v>

3050
01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:58.730
<v Speaker 13>grow as he is now.</v>

3051
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.350
<v Speaker 13>So you just shut up and you watch four hours of VHS and you go,</v>

3052
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:04.820

3054
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:11.660
<v Speaker 13>And then you can go now Google is brand new and you go debunk and he's here all</v>

3859
02:02:29.050 --> 02:02:30.180
<v Speaker 15>why do we need states?</v>

3860
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:32.320
<v Speaker 15>States are like</v>

02:02:35.731 --> 02:02:38.010
<v Speaker 5>We arbitrarily draw and decide,</v>

3863
02:02:38.011 --> 02:02:38.690
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3864

<v Speaker 5>They just thought this was Wyoming.</v>

3866
02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:49.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't go there with my fucking gay porn and people would get mad at me.</v>

3867
02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:51.630
<v Speaker 5>Throw me in a fucking prison.</v>

3868
02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:52.650

3869
02:02:52.651 --> 02:02:53.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3870
02:02:53.250 --> 02:02:54.310
<v Speaker 5>It is ridiculous,</v>

3871
02:02:54.330 --> 02:02:54.911
<v Speaker 5>but it's great.</v>

3872
02:02:54.911 --> 02:02:55.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a great feeling up.</v>

3873
02:02:55.981 --> 02:02:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Your progress as you drive across the country.</v>

3874

3877
02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:12.980
<v Speaker 5>We can't all decide collectively without electoral colleges,</v>

3878
02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:14.850
<v Speaker 5>without senators and representative.</v>

3879
02:03:14.851 --> 02:03:15.960
<v Speaker 5>We don't need representatives.</v>

3880
02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.190
<v Speaker 5>We don't ride horses.</v>

<v Speaker 17>I want to go to that.</v>

3892
02:03:38.650 --> 02:03:39.341
<v Speaker 17>We're going to do it in this,</v>

3893
02:03:39.341 --> 02:03:40.174

<v Speaker 17>They make a difficult shot.</v>

3900
02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:50.860
<v Speaker 17>What about this job?</v>

3901
02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.890
<v Speaker 17>What if we divvy it up into 50 different countries?</v>

3902
02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:55.420
<v Speaker 17>No,</v>

3903
02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:56.253
<v Speaker 17>no.</v>

3906
02:03:58.780 --> 02:03:59.380
<v Speaker 17>A designer.</v>

3907
02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:00.340
<v Speaker 17>Why would you do that?</v>

3908
02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:02.710
<v Speaker 17>Cause then you'd stay away from certain countries,</v>

3909
02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:04.860
<v Speaker 17>but you're all be vulnerable.</v>

3910
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:08.650
<v Speaker 17>They can pick you off where we can all fucking go to war and he's 50 dude,</v>

3918
02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:19.361
<v Speaker 15>If we,</v>

<v Speaker 15>if we had a war of the countries,</v>

02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:51.150
<v Speaker 18>That's not a politician,</v>

4294
02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:54.360
<v Speaker 18>but it doesn't matter like he wasn't a politician when he got elected.</v>

4295
02:17:54.361 --> 02:17:55.230
<v Speaker 18>That was the whole thing.</v>

4296
02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:55.630
<v Speaker 18>No,</v>

4297
02:17:55.630 --> 02:17:55.900
<v Speaker 18>no,</v>

4298
02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:56.733
<v Speaker 18>no.</v>

4299
02:17:59.010 --> 02:18:02.490
<v Speaker 18>You're talking about going from never being a politician to the highest fucking</v>

4300
02:18:02.491 --> 02:18:03.150
<v Speaker 18>office ever.</v>

4301
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:04.950
<v Speaker 18>Exactly what Trump is doing.</v>

4302
02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:09.300
<v Speaker 18>Exactly what form you fucking lunatic.</v>

4303
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:13.890
<v Speaker 4>That is sexist shit right there.</v>

4304
02:18:13.891 --> 02:18:17.020
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say I didn't stay there.</v>

4305
02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:20.410
<v Speaker 4>That is the bullshit.</v>

4306
02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:21.293
<v Speaker 4>That is</v>

4307
02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:24.413
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

4308
02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:28.040
<v Speaker 18>I was a white knight and I was trying to fuck Stair Tiana.</v>

4309
02:18:28.041 --> 02:18:29.420
<v Speaker 18>I'd be yelling at you right now.</v>

4310
02:18:29.421 --> 02:18:29.661

02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:35.240
<v Speaker 18>It's fucking bullshit.</v>

4313
02:18:35.330 --> 02:18:36.650
<v Speaker 18>I'll wait till you're done.</v>

4314
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:38.080
<v Speaker 18>If you do think,</v>

4315
02:18:38.081 --> 02:18:38.571
<v Speaker 18>oh cool.</v>

4316
02:18:38.571 --> 02:18:39.560

4318
02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:52.993
<v Speaker 4>time</v>

02:18:54.390 --> 02:18:55.830
<v Speaker 4>he took his shirt off.</v>

4320
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:59.490
<v Speaker 4>We reacted to it.</v>

4321
02:19:02.590 --> 02:19:03.730
<v Speaker 18>Who's that fucking dope?</v>

4322
02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:05.650
<v Speaker 18>Who fucked up New York City?</v>

4323
02:19:05.651 --> 02:19:06.910
<v Speaker 18>Just cause he had $1 billion.</v>

4324
02:19:06.911 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 18>He was never an office.</v>

4325
02:19:07.991 --> 02:19:08.620
<v Speaker 18>Do you think that?</v>

4326
02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:09.130
<v Speaker 18>Yeah,</v>

4327
02:19:09.130 --> 02:19:13.120
<v Speaker 18>that fucking guy jerk off total fucking shirt off and he's got his desk.</v>

4328
02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:14.150
<v Speaker 18>So there you go.</v>

4329
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:15.850
<v Speaker 18>Mrs Bloom back.</v>

4330
02:19:19.390 --> 02:19:21.090
<v Speaker 18>Well it doesn't,</v>

4331
02:19:21.550 --> 02:19:21.701
<v Speaker 18>no,</v>

4332
02:19:21.701 --> 02:19:22.690
<v Speaker 18>I'm saying that guy,</v>

4333
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:27.890
<v Speaker 18>that guy was a jerk off and he actually transcended the state constitution and</v>

4334
02:19:27.891 --> 02:19:28.221
<v Speaker 18>was like,</v>

4335
02:19:28.221 --> 02:19:28.641
<v Speaker 18>fuck it.</v>

4336
02:19:28.641 --> 02:19:28.911
<v Speaker 18>I'm not.</v>

4337
02:19:28.911 --> 02:19:31.790
<v Speaker 18>Then being in the fucking guy here and continued on.</v>

4338
02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:32.810
<v Speaker 18>That was bullshit.</v>

4339
02:19:33.050 --> 02:19:33.883
<v Speaker 18>And this is the thing.</v>

4340
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:37.910
<v Speaker 18>If you fucking do the thing about all of this shit is if you criticize Hillary,</v>

4341
02:19:37.911 --> 02:19:39.380
<v Speaker 18>it means automatically you're a sexist.</v>

4342
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:40.520
<v Speaker 18>I didn't say that.</v>

4343
02:19:40.521 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 18>I just said that the first lady voted for Trump.</v>

4344
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:46.400
<v Speaker 18>If Hillary was really</v>

4345
02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:50.030
<v Speaker 18>no words in my mouth,</v>

4346
02:19:50.031 --> 02:19:51.200
<v Speaker 18>that's not what I said.</v>

4347
02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:53.270
<v Speaker 18>I'm putting what you said.</v>

4348
02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:58.130
<v Speaker 18>You said that someone with no experience can't take on the highest office of the</v>

4349
02:19:58.131 --> 02:19:58.520
<v Speaker 18>world.</v>

4350
02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.480
<v Speaker 18>And I said,</v>

4351
02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 18>but Trump just did that.</v>

4352
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 18>That's all I said.</v>

4353
02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:07.820
<v Speaker 18>Trump has had no experience and he's going to take over in the orbit.</v>

4354
02:20:07.821 --> 02:20:09.530
<v Speaker 18>That's all I was the point I was making.</v>

4355
02:20:09.531 --> 02:20:10.364
<v Speaker 18>I was not saying,</v>

4356
02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:12.920
<v Speaker 18>I don't understand what your point is.</v>

4357
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:18.680
<v Speaker 18>Why is Hillary is no different than a reality TV show stars,</v>

4358
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:19.211
<v Speaker 18>ladies.</v>

4359
02:20:19.211 --> 02:20:20.100
<v Speaker 18>That's like what your point.</v>

4360
02:20:20.110 --> 02:20:22.150
<v Speaker 18>You said the first lady right now,</v>

4361
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:25.940
<v Speaker 18>Michelle Obama could never be president because you can't go from a no</v>

4362
02:20:25.941 --> 02:20:28.540
<v Speaker 18>experience to running the biggest office in the world.</v>

4363
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:31.910
<v Speaker 18>I said I disagree because that's why 100% never said that.</v>

4364
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.241
<v Speaker 18>I,</v>

4365
02:20:32.241 --> 02:20:35.720
<v Speaker 18>that's what I thought you said June 1st I mean</v>

4366
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:40.640
<v Speaker 18>once you inferred.</v>

4367
02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:42.410
<v Speaker 18>I don't think so.</v>

4368
02:20:42.411 --> 02:20:43.244
<v Speaker 18>I'm,</v>

4369
02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:44.630
<v Speaker 18>I'm almost positive.</v>

4370
02:20:44.631 --> 02:20:48.110
<v Speaker 18>I just reacted to what you said so we can rewind it,</v>

4371
02:20:48.111 --> 02:20:48.771
<v Speaker 18>but if you did it,</v>

4372
02:20:48.771 --> 02:20:49.950
<v Speaker 18>you did it.</v>

4373
02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:54.980
<v Speaker 18>So you have a Twitter handle.</v>

4374
02:20:54.981 --> 02:20:55.670
<v Speaker 18>Hold on,</v>

4375
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:56.503
<v Speaker 18>hold on.</v>

4376
02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:58.790
<v Speaker 18>We got voted and like she would have to run.</v>

4377
02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:01.790
<v Speaker 18>I never said any of that.</v>

4378
02:21:01.850 --> 02:21:05.040
<v Speaker 18>All I said was the first lady has experienced</v>

4379
02:21:05.310 --> 02:21:05.590
<v Speaker 10>fence.</v>

4380
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:06.423
<v Speaker 10>Oh good.</v>

4381
02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:12.730
<v Speaker 10>How long were you said was you guys to be in dispute?</v>

4382
02:21:12.731 --> 02:21:13.410
<v Speaker 10>You're both.</v>

4383
02:21:13.410 --> 02:21:13.771
<v Speaker 18>We're not.</v>

4384
02:21:13.771 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 18>We're just disagreeing guys.</v>

4385
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:17.940
<v Speaker 18>The point that I'm making,</v>

4386
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:21.930
<v Speaker 18>if you're married to someone not in the field that you're in,</v>

4387
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:24.660
<v Speaker 18>does not make you qualified to do that job.</v>

4388
02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:25.650
<v Speaker 18>That's all I just said.</v>

4389
02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:28.420
<v Speaker 10>If you're married to a,</v>

4390
02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:31.890
<v Speaker 10>to a guy who built houses and you don't build houses,</v>

4391
02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:35.490
<v Speaker 10>that doesn't mean that I want to live in something that you just fucking built.</v>

4392
02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:36.271
<v Speaker 10>That's all I'm saying.</v>

4393
02:21:36.271 --> 02:21:36.450
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4394
02:21:36.450 --> 02:21:38.100
<v Speaker 10>you make some good points there.</v>

4395
02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:38.890
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4396
02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:39.180
<v Speaker 10>Kind of.</v>

4397
02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:40.013
<v Speaker 10>You'd like to say,</v>

4398
02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:40.321
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

4399
02:21:40.321 --> 02:21:40.580
<v Speaker 10>Whoa,</v>

4400
02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:41.413

4401
02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:42.691

4402
02:21:42.691 --> 02:21:44.040
<v Speaker 10>Tiana would also like to speak.</v>

4403
02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:44.781
<v Speaker 18>Well,</v>

4404
02:21:44.781 --> 02:21:45.980
<v Speaker 18>I'm just saying that like,</v>

4405
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:51.010
<v Speaker 18>of course you're saying that if she is Jesse because you're married to somebody</v>

4406
02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:52.880
<v Speaker 18>with a job.</v>

4407
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.710
<v Speaker 18>I feel,</v>

4408
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:58.570
<v Speaker 18>I feel like,</v>

4409
02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:02.090
<v Speaker 18>I feel like I'm listening to somebody.</v>

4410
02:22:02.091 --> 02:22:05.360
<v Speaker 18>Talk about where the Cleveland Indians were the best team in baseball last year.</v>

4411
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:07.130
<v Speaker 10>I mean it's already pretty much,</v>

<v Speaker 18>Everybody knows is Bob Backlund cliff.</v>

4424
02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:36.360
<v Speaker 11>This is therefore what you think.</v>

4425
02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:37.840
<v Speaker 11>That's all I was trying to try and set.</v>

02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:38.060
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

4427

4428
02:22:40.971 --> 02:22:42.890
<v Speaker 10>If you don't know how to do the job,</v>

4429
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:45.590
<v Speaker 10>why do we have democracy?</v>

4430
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:47.000
<v Speaker 10>Why are we voting?</v>

4431
02:22:47.390 --> 02:22:49.670
<v Speaker 10>We're fucking all dumb on this panel.</v>

4457
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:47.750
<v Speaker 10>My point was that democracy is flawed in that idiots can vote.</v>

4458
02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:51.320
<v Speaker 10>We're saying they can run to what they do.</v>

4459
02:23:51.350 --> 02:23:52.400
<v Speaker 10>They know what they do,</v>

4460
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:53.570
<v Speaker 10>but we vote for that.</v>

4461
02:23:53.571 --> 02:23:53.930
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

4462
02:23:53.930 --> 02:23:54.860
<v Speaker 10>Honest question.</v>

4463
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:56.030
<v Speaker 10>What's the solution?</v>

4464
02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:56.211
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:00.350
<v Speaker 10>Really?</v>

4468
02:24:00.350 --> 02:24:02.470
<v Speaker 10>There's no way I barely can keep putting that.</v>

4469
02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:04.310
<v Speaker 10>Paying attention to what the fuck I'm doing.</v>

4470
02:24:04.490 --> 02:24:05.340
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what you do.</v>

4471
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:07.640
<v Speaker 11>You know what I think the solution is?</v>

4472
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:12.110
<v Speaker 11>We just have to wait for idiots to die and we have to hope that like smarter</v>

4473
02:24:12.111 --> 02:24:13.370
<v Speaker 11>people keep getting born.</v>

4474
02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:15.700
<v Speaker 15>That's true.</v>

4475
02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:18.500
<v Speaker 15>That's why the Duggar's need to be executed.</v>

4476
02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.140
<v Speaker 15>We're not going anywhere else there.</v>

4477
02:24:21.141 --> 02:24:22.490
<v Speaker 15>I just had two daughters.</v>

4478
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:25.880
<v Speaker 15>You're part of the problem.</v>

4479
02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:26.991
<v Speaker 15>It's narrow.</v>

4480
02:24:26.991 --> 02:24:27.820
<v Speaker 15>Tiana</v>

4481
02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:29.350
<v Speaker 10>necessarily disagree with you,</v>

4482
02:24:29.351 --> 02:24:32.350
<v Speaker 10>but I think even those people that just a victim of circumstance.</v>

4483
02:24:32.410 --> 02:24:32.680
<v Speaker 10>Shit.</v>

4484

<v Speaker 10>Hillary won Nevada.</v>

4485
02:24:40.090 --> 02:24:41.380
<v Speaker 15>What were the odds on that?</v>

4486
02:24:41.381 --> 02:24:45.190
<v Speaker 15>Two 38 to 15 going into the fourth quarter.</v>

4487
02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:49.660
<v Speaker 15>Hillary's so excited with it had passed out.</v>

4488

4490
02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.710
<v Speaker 11>There's no waiting for Pennsylvania.</v>

4491
02:24:57.610 --> 02:24:59.020
<v Speaker 11>They have a called Wisconsin yet,</v>

4500
02:25:08.441 --> 02:25:09.540
<v Speaker 11>She has to get Wisconsin.</v>

4501
02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:13.420
<v Speaker 11>If she gets like the mustard colored sticks.</v>

02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:56.031
<v Speaker 1>Morgan Murphy,</v>

4579
02:27:56.031 --> 02:27:56.960
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you should be.</v>

4580
02:27:56.961 --> 02:27:58.610
<v Speaker 1>It could be as the main site.</v>

4581
02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:01.280
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking about a charitable donation.</v>

4582
02:28:01.850 --> 02:28:02.730
<v Speaker 1>All the money that we're,</v>

4584
02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.810
<v Speaker 1>we're not taking money from it.</v>

4585
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.861
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hope I or all the guests</v>

4588
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:12.530
<v Speaker 14>you would be with me.</v>

4589
02:28:12.531 --> 02:28:16.870
<v Speaker 14>We're not going to give this to a fucking charity that's going to get 90% to pay</v>

4590
02:28:16.871 --> 02:28:18.450
<v Speaker 14>a z o and make dijour.</v>

4591
02:28:18.470 --> 02:28:19.221
<v Speaker 14>It's absolutely,</v>

4592
02:28:19.221 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 14>absolutely we have to figure out to do with the money</v>

4593
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:23.023
<v Speaker 19>and we'll go with that.</v>

4594
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:24.560
<v Speaker 19>But we're not taking a dime.</v>

4595
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.981
<v Speaker 19>No.</v>

4596
02:28:24.981 --> 02:28:26.180
<v Speaker 19>We'll find something weird again.</v>

4597
02:28:26.190 --> 02:28:26.580
<v Speaker 19>A Kona.</v>

4598
02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:27.610
<v Speaker 19>Keep it here.</v>

02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:29.150
<v Speaker 19>We give it to the surplus card.</v>

4600
02:28:32.930 --> 02:28:33.920
<v Speaker 19>Oh my God.</v>

4601
02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:37.700
<v Speaker 19>Why don't you just sponsor people who want to move from this country?</v>

4602
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:40.920
<v Speaker 19>Why don't you sponsor people's trips out of the advocate?</v>

4603
02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:42.620
<v Speaker 19>That's the smartest move.</v>

4604
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:44.480
<v Speaker 19>Cause honestly,</v>

4605
02:28:44.481 --> 02:28:44.960
<v Speaker 19>when it,</v>

4606
02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:47.330
<v Speaker 19>the hardest thing is finding someone to help you move.</v>

4607
02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:48.850
<v Speaker 19>We found one bit,</v>

4608
02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:49.400
<v Speaker 19>I'm sorry.</v>

4609
02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:49.580

02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:54.710
<v Speaker 19>and you'll get selected.</v>

02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:56.030
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 11>The end of the day,</v>

02:39:42.010 --> 02:39:43.030
<v Speaker 11>That's your best bet.</v>

5000
02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:47.980
<v Speaker 11>To try to get someone with two fucking asis to give a fuck.</v>

5001
02:39:48.370 --> 02:39:53.020
<v Speaker 11>Is this the desk basically a trust fund kid to get them to give a shit about</v>

5002
02:39:53.021 --> 02:39:55.600
<v Speaker 11>anybody below someone who just owns a Chili's,</v>

5003
02:39:55.601 --> 02:39:57.130
<v Speaker 11>forget about the people who work there.</v>

5004
02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:58.630
<v Speaker 11>It's fucking impossible.</v>

5005
02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:59.820
<v Speaker 7>Most likely,</v>

5006
02:40:00.210 --> 02:40:01.200
<v Speaker 7>most likely,</v>

5007
02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:04.410
<v Speaker 7>depending upon how they're raised by their parents.</v>

5008
02:40:04.650 --> 02:40:07.800
<v Speaker 7>If they get really lucky and they find a conscientious parent,</v>

5009
02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:09.750
<v Speaker 7>it tries to explain to them things,</v>

5010
02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:12.300
<v Speaker 7>they'll get a more nuanced perspective of life,</v>

5011
02:40:12.570 --> 02:40:15.360
<v Speaker 7>but they're never to have the same perspective as a guy like Mike Tyson.</v>

5012
02:40:15.361 --> 02:40:19.770
<v Speaker 7>He grows up in a horrible neighborhood and learns how to just be the best of the</v>

5013
02:40:19.771 --> 02:40:24.771
<v Speaker 7>best with a fury that you cannot stop and that is only awarded to people that</v>

5014
02:40:25.381 --> 02:40:26.214
<v Speaker 7>are suppressed.</v>

5015
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:29.790
<v Speaker 7>There's this weird thing that happens with human beings when we're suppressed.</v>

5016
02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:32.760
<v Speaker 7>When added that emerges is very bizarre.</v>

5017
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:33.601
<v Speaker 7>Intense,</v>

5018
02:40:33.601 --> 02:40:38.601
<v Speaker 7>like almost Super Nova type energy that you see from people like Eddie Murphy or</v>

5019
02:40:38.761 --> 02:40:40.830
<v Speaker 7>Richard Pryor or Chris Rock.</v>

5020
02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:41.880
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of them.</v>

5021
02:40:41.970 --> 02:40:42.803
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

5022
02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:45.010
<v Speaker 11>I'll Trump Greg Fitzsimmons</v>

5023
02:40:47.890 --> 02:40:48.520
<v Speaker 11>sorry,</v>

5024
02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:49.480
<v Speaker 11>bring away to the Joe.</v>

5025
02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:50.670
<v Speaker 11>You guys just weren't there.</v>

5026
02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:51.090
<v Speaker 11>Sorry.</v>

5027
02:40:51.090 --> 02:40:51.940
<v Speaker 18>Can I say that?</v>

5028
02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:52.620
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>

5029
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:54.330
<v Speaker 18>have you heard that study about like,</v>

5030
02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:56.790
<v Speaker 18>you know how they tried to figure out like if everybody eat,</v>

5031
02:40:56.820 --> 02:40:59.700
<v Speaker 18>they always say like anybody can be president of the United States,</v>

5032
02:40:59.701 --> 02:40:59.971
<v Speaker 18>right?</v>

5033
02:40:59.971 --> 02:41:00.691
<v Speaker 18>Like anybody,</v>

5034
02:41:00.691 --> 02:41:03.810
<v Speaker 18>everybody in America has the same opportunities.</v>

5035
02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:08.760
<v Speaker 18>But what they've found is that some people have one opportunity and other people</v>

5036
02:41:08.761 --> 02:41:12.210
<v Speaker 18>have many opportunities and that's the difference.</v>

5037
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:14.380
<v Speaker 18>So are you saying the world is unfair?</v>

5038
02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:22.051
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

5039
02:41:22.051 --> 02:41:24.960
<v Speaker 11>but you're saying you're saying</v>

5040
02:41:32.610 --> 02:41:33.900
<v Speaker 11>100% agree with you.</v>

5041
02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:35.333
<v Speaker 11>The world is</v>

5042
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:35.881
<v Speaker 18>fair,</v>

5043
02:41:35.881 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 18>but what you're expecting is people have the advantage to take the time to have</v>

5044
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:40.350
<v Speaker 18>the,</v>

5045
02:41:40.350 --> 02:41:40.641
<v Speaker 18>the,</v>

5046
02:41:40.641 --> 02:41:40.911
<v Speaker 18>the,</v>

5047
02:41:40.911 --> 02:41:42.720
<v Speaker 18>the maturity to give a shit.</v>

5048
02:41:42.721 --> 02:41:43.710
<v Speaker 18>They're not going to do it.</v>

5049
02:41:43.711 --> 02:41:44.760
<v Speaker 18>That's not what I'm expecting.</v>

5050
02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:50.100
<v Speaker 18>That we have not been connected since the second you said 50% of it.</v>

5051
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:51.780
<v Speaker 18>I'll take 49</v>

5052
02:41:53.430 --> 02:41:54.263
<v Speaker 7>great example.</v>

5053
02:41:54.730 --> 02:41:55.501
<v Speaker 7>The Oscars.</v>

5054
02:41:55.501 --> 02:41:56.610
<v Speaker 7>Watch the Oscars right?</v>

5055
02:41:56.611 --> 02:41:58.530
<v Speaker 7>They're always talking about more and more diversity,</v>

5056
02:41:58.590 --> 02:42:02.400
<v Speaker 7>but it never changes because you're asking for somebody to give up their</v>

5057
02:42:02.401 --> 02:42:06.450
<v Speaker 7>nomination or their seat in the fucking show and they're never going to fucking</v>

5058
02:42:06.451 --> 02:42:10.350
<v Speaker 7>do it because they're cool change for everybody else as long as they get there</v>

5059
02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:11.550
<v Speaker 7>and that's why I won't fucking,</v>

5060
02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:14.010
<v Speaker 7>it's very hard to get anybody changed.</v>

5061
02:42:14.011 --> 02:42:15.200
<v Speaker 7>Could you ask him the sacrifice</v>

5062
02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:16.310
<v Speaker 18>because they're selfish.</v>

5063
02:42:16.610 --> 02:42:17.443
<v Speaker 11>It's good.</v>

5064
02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:18.600
<v Speaker 11>It's good to teach.</v>

5065
02:42:18.601 --> 02:42:20.880
<v Speaker 11>Somebody has on a yellow dress on CNN.</v>

5066
02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:22.693
<v Speaker 11>Beautiful.</v>

5067
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:25.740
<v Speaker 11>Don't you guys think that famine thinking</v>

5068
02:42:26.750 --> 02:42:28.220
<v Speaker 7>because there's a limited,</v>

5069
02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:32.450
<v Speaker 7>there's a limited ability to communicate with people you didn't know just</v>

5070
02:42:32.451 --> 02:42:33.070
<v Speaker 7>recently.</v>

5071
02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:33.221
<v Speaker 11>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 11>It's like,</v>

5077

5085
02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:57.490
<v Speaker 11>it doesn't taste good.</v>

5086
02:42:57.491 --> 02:42:58.324
<v Speaker 11>Powerful.</v>

5087
02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:00.300
<v Speaker 11>It's like mouthwash and the gum.</v>

5091

<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 11>you know something if you actually researched it,</v>

5171
02:45:27.621 --> 02:45:29.840
<v Speaker 11>it's still just as cause confusing.</v>

5172
02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:31.760
<v Speaker 11>I'm sure cause I looked at all,</v>

5173
02:45:31.761 --> 02:45:32.630
<v Speaker 11>I had all my shy,</v>

5174
02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:33.500
<v Speaker 11>my cheat sheet.</v>

5175
02:45:33.501 --> 02:45:38.360
<v Speaker 11>I was in and out in 30 seconds but like every fucking amendment was just like,</v>

5176
02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:43.420
<v Speaker 11>hey this is a man men to make sure the sun doesn't burn out and then we need the</v>

5177
02:45:44.121 --> 02:45:45.310
<v Speaker 11>sun to heat the earth.</v>

5178
02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:45.711
<v Speaker 11>You're like,</v>

5179
02:45:45.711 --> 02:45:45.951
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

02:45:45.951 --> 02:45:46.671
<v Speaker 11>I'm for this.</v>

5181
02:45:46.671 --> 02:45:48.110
<v Speaker 11>And then the next thing would be the argument.</v>

5182
02:45:48.111 --> 02:45:48.800
<v Speaker 11>It can be like,</v>

5183
02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:52.010
<v Speaker 11>actually this doesn't prevent the sun from burning out.</v>

5184
02:45:52.011 --> 02:45:53.480
<v Speaker 11>It's the exact opposite.</v>

5185
02:45:53.690 --> 02:45:57.230
<v Speaker 11>This is pouring water on the sun and by the end of it you're just like I don't,</v>

5186
02:45:57.231 --> 02:45:58.370
<v Speaker 11>I don't know who do I believe.</v>

5187
02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:01.580
<v Speaker 11>And then you just look at who was Ford Nra,</v>

5188
02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:02.870
<v Speaker 11>Ed Begley Jr.</v>

<v Speaker 11>It was all over the same day.</v>

5190
02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:06.410
<v Speaker 11>I knew like who agrees with this?</v>

5191
02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:08.030
<v Speaker 11>Who does this disagree with?</v>

5192
02:46:08.031 --> 02:46:08.990
<v Speaker 11>And that's what you went with.</v>

5193
02:46:09.890 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 11>That</v>

5194
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.873
<v Speaker 19>was it.</v>

5287
02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:40.460
<v Speaker 19>No condoms.</v>

5288
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:41.180
<v Speaker 19>No ICAD.</v>

5289
02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:41.750

<v Speaker 4>love it.</v>

5294
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:54.870
<v Speaker 19>Well because I think uh,</v>

5295
02:48:55.250 --> 02:48:57.730
<v Speaker 19>porn is ruining men and I think that if,</v>

5296
02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:58.040
<v Speaker 19>if,</v>

5297
02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:58.873
<v Speaker 19>if,</v>

5298
02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:04.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5299
02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:07.110
<v Speaker 4>she's and how she's right.</v>

5300
02:49:08.820 --> 02:49:09.211
<v Speaker 18>I get it.</v>

5301
02:49:09.211 --> 02:49:10.044

<v Speaker 18>I'm sorry.</v>

5304
02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:17.940
<v Speaker 18>I think that the one thing that porn is doing is like not making men like go out</v>

5305
02:49:20.681 --> 02:49:23.500
<v Speaker 18>and try to be like fucking like pickup chicks.</v>

5306
02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:27.550
<v Speaker 18>And I feel like if they stopped watching porn and tried to be resourceful,</v>

5307
02:49:27.551 --> 02:49:28.480
<v Speaker 18>that would be fucking</v>

5308
02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:35.280
<v Speaker 18>pornography.</v>

5309
02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:38.070
<v Speaker 18>No Man to try their thing.</v>

5310
02:49:38.450 --> 02:49:39.750
<v Speaker 18>She wants to get hit on.</v>

5311
02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:40.531
<v Speaker 18>I thought it was,</v>

5312
02:49:40.531 --> 02:49:41.364
<v Speaker 18>she cared about.</v>

5313
02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:43.621
<v Speaker 18>No,</v>

5314
02:49:43.621 --> 02:49:44.454
<v Speaker 18>that's not it.</v>

5315
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:49.890
<v Speaker 18>Millennials are having less sex than their parents.</v>

5316
02:49:49.891 --> 02:49:51.390
<v Speaker 18>Like guys don't want to go out and</v>

5317
02:49:57.580 --> 02:49:58.430
<v Speaker 18>just start a curious,</v>

5318
02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:00.600
<v Speaker 18>just out of curiosity,</v>

5319
02:50:00.690 --> 02:50:05.690
<v Speaker 18>how could they possibly know if millennials are having less sex than their past?</v>

5320
02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:08.970
<v Speaker 18>How do you know they do research?</v>

5321
02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:11.483
<v Speaker 18>How</v>

5322
02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:21.900

5329
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:37.330

5330
02:50:38.451 --> 02:50:42.350
<v Speaker 18>and porn and like why would they want to go out and fucking meet women?</v>

5331
02:50:42.570 --> 02:50:43.560
<v Speaker 18>I voted no.</v>

5332
02:50:43.890 --> 02:50:45.600
<v Speaker 18>I'm not saying they need to meet me,</v>

5333
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:50.940
<v Speaker 18>meet me spitting in each other's mouths</v>

5334
02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:55.750
<v Speaker 5>with the women in his life and he wants just release.</v>

5335
02:50:56.370 --> 02:50:57.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm fine with that.</v>

5336
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:59.880
<v Speaker 5>His testicles</v>

5337
02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:04.530
<v Speaker 5>influencing my decision.</v>

5338
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:05.463
<v Speaker 5>Are you released</v>

5339

<v Speaker 5>and it helps to man.</v>

5340
02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:12.090
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes if you watch other people,</v>

5341
02:51:12.091 --> 02:51:12.924
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>everything in excess including washing your fucking hands,</v>

5349
02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:40.000
<v Speaker 18>It was pushes it further underground and makes it more dangerous so the girls</v>

5350
02:51:40.191 --> 02:51:42.260
<v Speaker 18>have to have sex in worse places.</v>

5351
02:51:42.290 --> 02:51:42.771
<v Speaker 18>That's all.</v>

<v Speaker 15>I'm going to take the next several shades of gray was the biggest selling book</v>

5422
02:54:17.691 --> 02:54:19.790
<v Speaker 15>in the history of fucking human beings.</v>

5423
02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:21.380
<v Speaker 15>Okay.</v>

5424
02:54:21.380 --> 02:54:24.380
<v Speaker 15>It brought back were we're running down a row.</v>

5425
02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:25.513
<v Speaker 15>Yes.</v>

5426
02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:28.253
<v Speaker 15>Crazy,</v>

5427
02:54:28.370 --> 02:54:33.220
<v Speaker 15>crazy bitches across the globe when asking random dudes and spit them out,</v>

5428
02:54:33.470 --> 02:54:35.510
<v Speaker 15>do you understand what the fuck happened?</v>

5429
02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:38.630
<v Speaker 15>One person wrote a crazy book to cracked.</v>

5430
02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:41.840
<v Speaker 15>That's so true.</v>

5431
02:54:41.841 --> 02:54:44.090
<v Speaker 15>It's like we got to keep that door shut.</v>

5432
02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:48.510
<v Speaker 18>The lady that's all that.</v>

5433
02:54:48.511 --> 02:54:53.511
<v Speaker 18>I just think that it's more interesting to not try to push me in certain</v>

5434
02:54:54.770 --> 02:54:56.740
<v Speaker 18>positions that I can do anymore.</v>

5435
02:54:57.410 --> 02:54:58.640
<v Speaker 18>I think a really good point.</v>

5436
02:54:59.320 --> 02:54:59.510
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

5437
02:54:59.510 --> 02:55:04.510
<v Speaker 18>I just think it gives men a negative imagery and a false of what a woman's body</v>

5438
02:55:04.911 --> 02:55:09.260
<v Speaker 18>is like and instead of paying attention to what I need and what I want porn and</v>

5439
02:55:09.261 --> 02:55:12.650
<v Speaker 18>then you can't get off and then they can't get off because they're just thinking</v>

5440
02:55:12.651 --> 02:55:13.660
<v Speaker 18>about Sa.</v>

5441
02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:16.190
<v Speaker 18>They can't in your circumstance,</v>

5442
02:55:16.191 --> 02:55:17.480
<v Speaker 18>but that's what part is.</v>

5443
02:55:17.850 --> 02:55:20.450
<v Speaker 18>I'm just telling you it's all I can think that's what porn is though.</v>

5444
02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:21.950
<v Speaker 18>Porn is a false imagery.</v>

5445
02:55:21.951 --> 02:55:22.580
<v Speaker 18>It's just something.</v>

5446
02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:22.760
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

5926
03:11:37.741 --> 03:11:40.500

5931
03:11:43.561 --> 03:11:45.000
<v Speaker 19>but we can make fun of what's going on.</v>

5932
03:11:45.001 --> 03:11:45.880
<v Speaker 19>But now it's a fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

5936
03:11:46.801 --> 03:11:50.370
<v Speaker 10>The what part of the reason Doug wanted to cancel it because he figured Hilary</v>

5937
03:11:50.371 --> 03:11:51.204
<v Speaker 10>was gonna win.</v>

5938
03:11:51.420 --> 03:11:51.871
<v Speaker 10>And he was like,</v>

5939
03:11:51.871 --> 03:11:52.060
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

5940

03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:53.170
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

5942
03:11:53.170 --> 03:11:57.860
<v Speaker 10>that was the excuse I gave Rogan when I was begging him to make me get,</v>

5943
03:11:58.230 --> 03:11:59.940
<v Speaker 10>please don't make me do this.</v>

5944
03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:02.280
<v Speaker 17>And then my life got worse.</v>

5945
03:12:02.340 --> 03:12:02.411
<v Speaker 17>Oh,</v>

5946
03:12:02.411 --> 03:12:03.091
<v Speaker 17>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

5947
03:12:03.091 --> 03:12:04.650
<v Speaker 17>I thought if we were starting at seven,</v>

5948
03:12:04.651 --> 03:12:05.670
<v Speaker 17>I thought it was going to be over.</v>

5949
03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.940
<v Speaker 17>I just thought everyone was going to vote for Hillary because she was more than</v>

5950
03:12:08.941 --> 03:12:09.391
<v Speaker 17>made guy.</v>

5951
03:12:09.391 --> 03:12:10.590
<v Speaker 17>He was a reality show star.</v>

5952
03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:12.450
<v Speaker 17>And then I was like halfway through I was like,</v>

5953
03:12:12.451 --> 03:12:13.200
<v Speaker 17>Oh shit,</v>

5954

5955
03:12:14.641 --> 03:12:15.474

5956
03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:17.850
<v Speaker 17>And then somewhere halfway through that I was like,</v>

5957
03:12:17.851 --> 03:12:18.481
<v Speaker 17>oh my God,</v>

5958
03:12:18.481 --> 03:12:19.680
<v Speaker 17>this guy might be president.</v>

5959
03:12:21.090 --> 03:12:22.460
<v Speaker 17>This is fucking terrifying.</v>

5960
03:12:22.780 --> 03:12:24.940
<v Speaker 17>You and I know you knew it was hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 17>Still about 6:59 PM and ever since then I'm like,</v>

5962
03:12:28.411 --> 03:12:29.121

5964
03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:31.470
<v Speaker 17>this is fucking crazy.</v>

5965
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.330
<v Speaker 17>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 19>which is one of the most,</v>

6025
03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:19.700
<v Speaker 19>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

6026
03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:21.160
<v Speaker 19>You're putting those words in my mouth.</v>

6027
03:14:21.890 --> 03:14:22.970
<v Speaker 19>Well then stop doing that.</v>

03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:43.020
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6040
03:14:43.020 --> 03:14:44.820
<v Speaker 6>make a salient point.</v>

6041
03:14:44.850 --> 03:14:46.290
<v Speaker 6>If it gets uncomfortable.</v>

6042
03:14:46.590 --> 03:14:47.460
<v Speaker 6>It's right here.</v>

6043
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:48.530
<v Speaker 6>I think he's been Borgen.</v>

6044
03:14:48.531 --> 03:14:49.364
<v Speaker 6>I think</v>

6045
03:14:49.690 --> 03:14:51.820
<v Speaker 19>make a good point and they're going to watch this again.</v>

6046
03:14:53.220 --> 03:14:55.600
<v Speaker 19>Here it comes to qualified person and you go,</v>

6047
03:14:55.601 --> 03:14:55.841
<v Speaker 19>okay,</v>

6048
03:14:55.841 --> 03:14:56.790
<v Speaker 19>why didn't she make it go?</v>

6049
03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:59.090
<v Speaker 19>There's clearly people in this country who are raises,</v>

6050
03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:01.210
<v Speaker 19>who are misogynistic or homophobic,</v>

6051
03:15:01.230 --> 03:15:02.860
<v Speaker 19>who are Zena phobic?</v>

6052
03:15:02.890 --> 03:15:04.690
<v Speaker 19>How can you just blow off all of those?</v>

6053
03:15:04.691 --> 03:15:07.060
<v Speaker 19>Like like how many felonies do you have to be accused of</v>

6054
03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:09.760
<v Speaker 19>things as well?</v>

6055
03:15:09.761 --> 03:15:11.140
<v Speaker 19>I'm not saying he's a good guy.</v>

6056
03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:11.520
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>

6057
03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:14.740
<v Speaker 19>I'm just saying that you can't literally just say the reason why you're not</v>

6058
03:15:14.741 --> 03:15:19.300
<v Speaker 19>voting for Clinton is because you're a misogynist is actually sexist shit.</v>

6059
03:15:19.450 --> 03:15:21.050
<v Speaker 19>She's almost people who voted for him.</v>

6060
03:15:22.250 --> 03:15:23.083
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

6061
03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:24.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're saying.</v>

6062
03:15:25.250 --> 03:15:25.501
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6063
03:15:25.501 --> 03:15:25.870
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>

6064
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:26.021
<v Speaker 19>No,</v>

6065
03:15:26.021 --> 03:15:29.200
<v Speaker 19>I don't believe that all the people voted for Trump are smart enough to assess</v>

6066
03:15:29.201 --> 03:15:30.520
<v Speaker 19>every wrong doing that.</v>

6067
03:15:30.521 --> 03:15:31.990
<v Speaker 19>They think Clinton that I did.</v>

6068
03:15:31.991 --> 03:15:32.770
<v Speaker 19>I think that they,</v>

6069
03:15:32.770 --> 03:15:34.360
<v Speaker 19>I think that's cause you live out here.</v>

6070
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:35.051
<v Speaker 19>Sure.</v>

03:15:35.051 --> 03:15:38.650
<v Speaker 19>I live in a bubble because you live out here and you think everybody who doesn't</v>

6072
03:15:38.651 --> 03:15:41.320

6073
03:15:41.410 --> 03:15:42.011
<v Speaker 19>Oh Shit.</v>

6074
03:15:42.011 --> 03:15:42.041
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

03:15:42.500 --> 03:15:43.151
<v Speaker 6>is drawn away.</v>

6077
03:15:43.151 --> 03:15:43.984
<v Speaker 6>By the way.</v>

6078
03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:47.980
<v Speaker 6>Would it be to be in the middle of a breakup and have bill burr walk in the door</v>

6079
03:15:47.981 --> 03:15:48.460

6091
03:16:19.391 --> 03:16:19.621
<v Speaker 17>he says,</v>

6092
03:16:19.621 --> 03:16:23.070
<v Speaker 17>because people are sexist and you're ignoring all of this other shit and they're</v>

<v Speaker 7>that's our big romance.</v>

6644
03:34:58.781 --> 03:34:59.201
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

6645
03:34:59.201 --> 03:35:00.760
<v Speaker 7>like in a pretty woman,</v>

6646
03:35:01.690 --> 03:35:03.280
<v Speaker 7>the hooker with a heart of gold,</v>

03:35:03.430 --> 03:35:04.060
<v Speaker 7>hope,</v>

03:35:04.060 --> 03:35:04.421
<v Speaker 7>hope.</v>

6649
03:35:04.421 --> 03:35:08.770
<v Speaker 7>Some rich businessman comes and rescues or we hope that some person pretends to</v>

6650
03:35:08.771 --> 03:35:10.960
<v Speaker 7>be someone other than what they really are.</v>

6651
03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:12.250
<v Speaker 7>Then it gets into office.</v>

6652
03:35:12.251 --> 03:35:13.360
<v Speaker 7>Then once they get in there,</v>

6653
03:35:13.420 --> 03:35:14.253
<v Speaker 7>they show us.</v>

6654
03:35:14.320 --> 03:35:19.150
<v Speaker 7>They really have purely altruistic intentions and they want to take care of us,</v>

6655
03:35:19.390 --> 03:35:21.220
<v Speaker 7>but we've never found anybody like that.</v>

6656
03:35:22.390 --> 03:35:22.930
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

6657
03:35:22.930 --> 03:35:23.741
<v Speaker 7>They get inside.</v>

6658
03:35:23.741 --> 03:35:25.090
<v Speaker 7>They just want to get their dick sucked.</v>

6699
03:36:35.020 --> 03:36:36.370
<v Speaker 10>So lopsided.</v>

6700
03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:41.400
<v Speaker 18>And then I heard today that a lot of people like it when people were pulling,</v>

6701
03:36:41.860 --> 03:36:43.180
<v Speaker 18>like a lot of people said,</v>

6704
03:36:44.471 --> 03:36:47.890

03:36:47.891 --> 03:36:49.540
<v Speaker 18>were so liberal lie.</v>
