1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.290
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

3
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.123
<v Speaker 1>There's</v>

4
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.921
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo,</v>

5
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.701
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cowen,</v>

6
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub,</v>

7
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.741
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo.</v>

8
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>The man introduced me to marijuana for him.</v>

9
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I will forever be grateful for medical reasons.</v>

10
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:13.861
<v Speaker 1>Medical reasons,</v>

11
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>medical reasons.</v>

12
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.531
<v Speaker 1>totally illegal.</v>

14
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't even know</v>

15
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>what is it that goes into effect?</v>

16
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.651
<v Speaker 1>It's now,</v>

17
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>it was midnight that night.</v>

18
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>What's legal?</v>

19
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana recreationally legal.</v>

20
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.093
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

21
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You got to be 18 or 21 I think you have to be 21 but now with attorney general</v>

22
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Jeff sessions,</v>

23
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>if he gets confirmed,</v>

24
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>can he override the federal powers do not painted.</v>

25
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>He would go against the will of Trump.</v>

26
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Trump for all of his faults that you might find in him,</v>

27
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a populist.</v>

28
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

29
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I think the best argument is that a guy like him,</v>

30
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of influence him with the,</v>

31
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the opinion of the country,</v>

32
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.561
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

33
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of an interesting thing because it might be one of the first</v>

34
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:58.681
<v Speaker 1>times ever,</v>

35
00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

36
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>the opinion of the country might significantly influenced some guy who's just</v>

37
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>completely foreign to the idea of politics.</v>

38
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a good thing.</v>

39
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Like many things in life,</v>

41
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:12.871
<v Speaker 1>very practical.</v>

42
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>This is not perfect.</v>

43
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's perfect like many things in life,</v>

44
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>but it might ultimately be a good thing to completely shake up the system.</v>

45
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>The thing that troubles people that oppose that idea is all the Wall Street guys</v>

46
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>he's bringing in like right away he's bringing in all these billionaires and</v>

47
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.664
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs.</v>

48
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>He's bringing a lot of business people to practical as well,</v>

49
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>so who understand the economy will sit and wait,</v>

50
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

51
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>it might be good.</v>

52
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>That might be a good thing and you might,</v>

53
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>that might be what they need to honestly figure out the economy and isn't a,</v>

54
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not saying it's impossible,</v>

55
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's definite,</v>

56
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it possible that you could be a billionaire and still want to fix the</v>

57
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:52.884
<v Speaker 1>fucked up?</v>

58
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you have everything you've ever wanted.</v>

59
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these guys,</v>

60
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>they do operate on that,</v>

61
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

62
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.890
<v Speaker 1>infinite growth idea,</v>

63
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>like to constantly want to give bigger yards,</v>

64
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>bigger match.</v>

65
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.733
<v Speaker 1>It's bigger houses,</v>

66
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible that God could be just an intelligent guy that did really</v>

67
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.054
<v Speaker 1>well in business.</v>

68
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Like even some of the things Trump said himself.</v>

69
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.281
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

70
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:11.461
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

71
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I took advantage of these loopholes,</v>

72
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>but let's get rid of him.</v>

73
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't think about what he did for a long time,</v>

74
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>which was he was at,</v>

75
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>he owned what hotels,</v>

76
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>buildings and wanted to give you the best experience possible.</v>

77
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>A guy like that who has,</v>

78
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>he has a massive ego of course is it's going to do,</v>

79
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>he wants a legacy he can point to.</v>

80
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>He wants to go down as the greatest presidents who wants to fix the fix these</v>

81
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.491
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

82
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:33.271
<v Speaker 1>I can see that.</v>

83
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Hope my worry.</v>

84
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>That's where his ego's my worry is that a guy like that is used to getting his</v>

85
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:38.334
<v Speaker 1>way all the time.</v>

86
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 1>That did.</v>

87
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>The nature of the presidency is one in which you don't get your way,</v>

88
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>where you have to compromise what you've got to like.</v>

89
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you get very frustrated with the power.</v>

90
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.624
<v Speaker 1>You don't have</v>

91
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot though in business like he's filed for chapter 11 multiple times,</v>

92
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>like he's had a lot of failures as as all business,</v>

93
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>most successful people have.</v>

94
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.771
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

95
00:02:58.771 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I wonder when,</v>

96
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>what's</v>

97
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>going to happen when he can't convince companies to do his bidding,</v>

98
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:10.381
<v Speaker 2>when a lot of his policies maybe don't give his voter base the jobs they wanted</v>

99
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.620
<v Speaker 2>because he can't implement the policies he wants.</v>

100
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>That's when it's going to be interested.</v>

101
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we'll see an assassination attempt?</v>

102
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Jesus crushed printed Shab what?</v>

103
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:20.614
<v Speaker 2>Man?</v>

104
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to happen.</v>

105
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.861
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

106
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:24.694
<v Speaker 2>It was a crazy,</v>

107
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell me people are upset.</v>

108
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.911
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

109
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people that's always pasta.</v>

110
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 2>What kind of people?</v>

111
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>People have tried to kill the president many times.</v>

112
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Most of America,</v>

113
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Hillary won the popular vote.</v>

114
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Actually currently it by what?</v>

115
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.931
<v Speaker 2>55 500,000 but the crazy thing about the debate between Hillary and Trump,</v>

116
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Trump's done some debug things or whatever,</v>

117
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 2>but when he goes,</v>

118
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you guys know what pizza gate is about.</v>

119
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.523
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

120
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>are you familiar with it?</v>

121
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Pizza Gate?</v>

122
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

123
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.453
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

124
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.720
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

125
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

126
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

127
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.791
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

128
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 2>But I never heard of him.</v>

129
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 2>He's explained to me and I said,</v>

130
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to explain it.</v>

131
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get to it,</v>

132
00:03:58.391 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just [inaudible] shit.</v>

133
00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.771
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

134
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

135
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>

136
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.174
<v Speaker 2>Before you go into it,</v>

137
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>it's been debunked.</v>

138
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>It's the biggest bunch of bullshit.</v>

139
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

140
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 2>it's fake news.</v>

141
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>They felt moved his fake news.</v>

142
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.423
<v Speaker 2>It's the fee.</v>

143
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 2>So the debit credit for the power,</v>

144
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>the power structure and the Democratic Party are pedophiles and they all</v>

145
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 2>communicate with each other with those secret paddles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's in Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza and apparently they have art that's like</v>

229
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.380
<v Speaker 1>this kind of famous pedophile like Pat Art,</v>

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.890
<v Speaker 1>which is close to the man love is that finishes.</v>

231
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>What about those paintings?</v>

232
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

233
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

234
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.801
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

235
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

236
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.611
<v Speaker 1>he's not saying,</v>

237
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>he's just saying it's just also with some hands on what it would do.</v>

238
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:39.771
<v Speaker 1>But Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are the paintings that they're being accused of having love?</v>

240
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

241
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.021
<v Speaker 1>but not that.</v>

242
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Not the symbol.</v>

243
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.221
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

244
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>there's some paintings that were connected to,</v>

245
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

246
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>There was some like very bizarre.</v>

247
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It disturbed the shit out of me so much.</v>

248
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.051
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

249
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spend any time looking at this.</v>

250
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.811
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

251
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I know for sure though,</v>

252
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.521
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

253
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>100% that speaker of the House Guy,</v>

254
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Hastert.</v>

255
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

256
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>they've got put away for like 15 months for being an admitted child molester.</v>

257
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

258
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you could only get in the idea that this guy was the speaker of</v>

259
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>

260
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Yikes.</v>

261
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>He was the speaker of the house and he was fucking kids when he was a wrestling</v>

262
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>coach and eating pizza and now this is a different guy.</v>

263
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.033
<v Speaker 1>Well that was stabbed.</v>

264
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.791
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it.</v>

265
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was.</v>

266
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was because he's old and he's very sick and ill,</v>

267
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>but it means nothing to me.</v>

268
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you could take,</v>

269
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>get a admitted kit fucker and you only give him 15 months.</v>

270
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>That's shit.</v>

271
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>There's more to the story.</v>

272
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is.</v>

273
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is more of the story,</v>

274
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:41.471
<v Speaker 1>but the facts remain that that guy got a very short sentence end was the speaker</v>

275
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>of the house and it was like a child molester.</v>

276
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.741
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

277
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>100% was normal.</v>

278
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>But there are always going to be pedophiles now,</v>

280
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>but instead of having this like gigantic blanket attitude that what he's saying</v>

281
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>is ridiculous and then getting super emotional about it.</v>

282
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's just look at the actual fact that a guy who was a pedophile was the</v>

283
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>speaker of the House has nothing to do with this store.</v>

284
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.341
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

285
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

286
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 1>But to mock the idea that people were pedophiles can't get the high positions of</v>

287
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>power was exactly what you were doing.</v>

288
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:12.101
<v Speaker 1>It's not an old one.</v>

289
00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It's where are you getting real emotional?</v>

290
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was getting emotional because this story was proven through many</v>

291
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.510
<v Speaker 1>independent lines of inquiry I believe to be,</v>

292
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 1>to be literally a hoax.</v>

293
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>And when you give it a voice,</v>

294
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>when it's a hoax and you know these people look at it way closer to anybody at</v>

295
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>this table and it's not about the conspiracies to here.</v>

296
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.571
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to do is,</v>

297
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to say guys,</v>

298
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.401
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

299
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:34.881
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

300
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

301
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>this was kind of a,</v>

302
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>this was a big hoax and so many different people who looked at who,</v>

303
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it,</v>

304
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>they don't have an agenda.</v>

305
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>They looked into it and I'm like,</v>

306
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

307
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:43.971
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

308
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a fake story,</v>

309
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but one of those fake science.</v>

310
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

311
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.763
<v Speaker 1>Just makes sense.</v>

312
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Do we really want to spend time on fake Remy?</v>

313
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about real stories.</v>

314
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Let me establish where I am.</v>

315
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I know the very brief outline of what it's all about.</v>

316
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I know that a lot of people think are pedophiles and crazy and Satan worshipers</v>

317
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 3>and there was that some spirit cooking thing,</v>

318
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 3>some bizarre thing that was a released in an email about something that Podesta</v>

319
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:08.650
<v Speaker 3>was going to get into.</v>

320
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:08.971
<v Speaker 3>True,</v>

321
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:09.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

322
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

323
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:10.951
<v Speaker 3>that's true,</v>

324
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's like some bizarre,</v>

325
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck it is.</v>

326
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

327
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

328
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we've not even knows.</v>

329
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 3>All that won't speak up over here.</v>

330
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Looked into it deeply and I,</v>

331
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll conspiracy theories make sense to me now.</v>

332
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

333
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.713
<v Speaker 3>Every single one.</v>

334
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.803
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

335
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 3>That's annoying.</v>

336
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.661
<v Speaker 3>Kind of.</v>

337
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I can a guy speak in general terms without being checked every got damn time.</v>

338
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.141
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

339
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

340
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:40.741
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

341
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:41.574
<v Speaker 3>It's general.</v>

342
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.893
<v Speaker 3>When it got dead,</v>

343
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 3>he beat him every God damn time.</v>

344
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 3>I would say damn time,</v>

345
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 3>but 90% of the time do you know who you're explaining this shit any would you</v>

346
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 3>admit?</v>

347
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 3>And speaking in general terms,</v>

348
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.340
<v Speaker 3>what do I got to give you actual numbers.</v>

349
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 3>But Eddie would you admit it?</v>

350
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 3>You admit that human beings,</v>

351
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.211
<v Speaker 3>you me,</v>

352
00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>all of us tend to get a feeling and then we have what's called confirmation</v>

353
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.141
<v Speaker 3>bias,</v>

354
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 3>which is we'll find,</v>

355
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 3>we'll find we all,</v>

356
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 3>we all do it.</v>

357
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.221
<v Speaker 3>I do it,</v>

358
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 3>we'll do it.</v>

359
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 3>We'll find,</v>

360
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll find facts to support our feeling.</v>

361
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 3>That's so human.</v>

362
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

363
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.670
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is hear an argument between me and my wife and I'll fucking</v>

364
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 3>justify it any way I can.</v>

365
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Cause I find facts to get until the Highland on,</v>

366
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:17.934
<v Speaker 3>on my side.</v>

367
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:19.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

368
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 3>So let's all be careful about confirmation bias.</v>

369
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean all I'm saying is like to just to get super emotional and say it's</v>

370
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>

371
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't necessarily think it is impossible.</v>

372
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 3>If that speaker of the house guy was in place,</v>

373
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 3>this story particularly in particular pizza gate,</v>

374
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:38.784
<v Speaker 3>you just got to love them.</v>

375
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I know zero about story,</v>

376
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 3>but let me,</v>

377
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.323
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

378
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm from where I am.</v>

379
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I looked into it very little.</v>

380
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:45.730
<v Speaker 3>I saw it was,</v>

381
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

382
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just let this scuffle go on and then look into it when the dust</v>

383
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 3>settles and a couple of weeks and that scared that figure out exactly what it</v>

384
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.061
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

385
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 3>whether it's bullshit or real.</v>

386
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.441
<v Speaker 3>It made me,</v>

387
00:10:56.441 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 3>me looking into it made me want to shut the fuck up about conspiracy theories</v>

388
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:01.270
<v Speaker 3>because people,</v>

389
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

390
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 3>people get killed when you actually look into it and I'm like Brian,</v>

391
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 3>count when you actually look into it.</v>

392
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

393
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 3>With LP to fucking mind.</v>

394
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:09.864
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

395
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Shim it.</v>

396
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

397
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.933
<v Speaker 3>I trust.</v>

398
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust you need a politician.</v>

399
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.603
<v Speaker 3>That shit.</v>

400
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying truth is somewhere in the middle.</v>

401
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:22.951
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

402
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:27.951
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody picks a position and I bet it's probably not nearly as fucked</v>

403
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 3>up as everybody's making it out to be,</v>

404
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.380
<v Speaker 3>but there's some weird,</v>

405
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:31.891

<v Speaker 3>I was like really?</v>

408
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:34.370
<v Speaker 3>In the UFO shows too.</v>

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.260
<v Speaker 3>There's smoke,</v>

410
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 3>there's fire guys,</v>

00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

413
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.231
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

414
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:37.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

415
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't stopped,</v>

416
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.040
<v Speaker 3>isn't pedestrian.</v>

417
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

418
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

419
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.823
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe so.</v>

420
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

421
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.001
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

422
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:42.834
<v Speaker 3>I care about that.</v>

423
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 3>And you just storm troops over there in the middle of what I'm saying is I'm</v>

424
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:51.330
<v Speaker 3>reacting to what I had read from credible sources as we wish.</v>

425
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:54.200
<v Speaker 3>You can cite what it says she</v>

426
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.123
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

427
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

428
00:11:55.341 --> 00:11:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

434
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw it up on one of the big screen and then we'll knock this out.</v>

435
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

436
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 2>All I got to say is,</v>

437
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to get into it,</v>

438
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 2>but all you need to do is go to youtube and watch the conspiracy of silence.</v>

439
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a documentary.</v>

440
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>How long has it was supposed to be on the BBC,</v>

441
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 2>but they never aired it.</v>

442
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:14.314
<v Speaker 2>Who made it?</v>

443
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.183
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

444

00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Who made it important?</v>

447
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

448

<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

450
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.041
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

451
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:21.791
<v Speaker 2>Disney made it.</v>

452
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:21.891
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

453
00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I've done don't you believe to have Disney made it?</v>

454
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.160
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell is pizzagate?</v>

455
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.073

462
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Here's a computer as well.</v>

463
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.800
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because the two,</v>

464
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 2>you guys are so on the opposite end of the holes and conspiracy thing.</v>

465
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Complete Ahmoud tend to immediately go towards conspiracies.</v>

466
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:50.881
<v Speaker 2>He tends to immediately go towards the mainstream [inaudible].</v>

467
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Those guys guys want someone to convince me.</v>

468
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not that what it is is I tend to not trust shit.</v>

469
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.170
<v Speaker 2>They say he tends to trust everything they say.</v>

470
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.093
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Scenario,</v>

471
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.700
<v Speaker 2>that's not a fair characterization.</v>

472
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 2>On the macro story side,</v>

473
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:09.971
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

474
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 2>you're one of those guys.</v>

475
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.043
<v Speaker 2>I read</v>

476
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post</v>

477
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 2>New York Times,</v>

478
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.821
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

479
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:23.400
<v Speaker 2>the second oldest magazine in the world.</v>

480
00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:24.234
<v Speaker 2>You read all of them.</v>

481
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.841
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the Bulls?</v>

482
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how those editorial boards,</v>

483
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 2>you study the bullshit he do.</v>

484
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 2>You know how those editorial boards work?</v>

485
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you know you?</v>

486
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you really think that the entire editorial board of the New York Times or the</v>

487
00:13:37.021 --> 00:13:40.540
<v Speaker 2>wall or the economist or the Wall Street Journal where people who run the</v>

488
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 2>country in the world get their information?</v>

489
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you think all those people are lying game together and being conspiratorial</v>

490
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 2>to give us fake news and for what?</v>

491
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Is that really what you believe?</v>

492
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.813
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly it.</v>

493
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.541
<v Speaker 2>It's been proven.</v>

494
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 2>They spent $500 million.</v>

495
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 2>It's Eddie put up two books that I do believe.</v>

496
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 2>So everything that the New York Times,</v>

497
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 2>The Wall Street Journal,</v>

498
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 2>the Economist reports,</v>

499
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.230
<v Speaker 2>not everything.</v>

500
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:06.020
<v Speaker 2>And what the,</v>

501
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 2>just the agenda.</v>

502
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Just getting me a gen y.</v>

503
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Speaker 2>There's an agenda.</v>

504
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 2>21 is,</v>

505
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't Eddie,</v>

506
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but I want you to tell me,</v>

507
00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 2>you know what the new world order is.</v>

508
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.531
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

509
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:15.364
<v Speaker 2>but do you know,</v>

510
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.820
<v Speaker 2>of course you don't because you think people are controlling everything like the</v>

511
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:21.000
<v Speaker 2>world economy or the oil markets.</v>

512
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.660
<v Speaker 2>How'd you know how oil is priced?</v>

513
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how oil is priced?</v>

514
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

515
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:24.971
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

516
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:25.141
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

517
00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 2>it's an open market commodity.</v>

518
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a world commodity,</v>

519
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

520
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 2>So it really depends on how much is available in that given day.</v>

521
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:31.991
<v Speaker 2>So exam,</v>

522
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 2>for an example,</v>

523
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.210
<v Speaker 2>you may have an oil tanker that it's on its way to a country and then somebody</v>

524
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>on the market in the market place bids on that oil and wants that oil and that</v>

525
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 2>ship will turn back around and go to that market.</v>

526
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:48.790
<v Speaker 2>It all depends on what the marketplace and what all the different players who</v>

527
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 2>need oil and the amount of oil that's available,</v>

528
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>whether it's crude or raw,</v>

529
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:53.504
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be.</v>

530
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

531
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different factors that go into pricing oil.</v>

532
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Look at what happened,</v>

533
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:04.661
<v Speaker 2>look at what happened when we came up with ways to shale to to get the the oil</v>

534
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 2>out of the Shales Sands,</v>

535
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:06.674
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

536
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Well what happened?</v>

537
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 2>The price of oil went down because the United States became an exporter of oil.</v>

538
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 2>There was such,</v>

539
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 2>there was an oil glut and that's why Russia is having a major problem because</v>

540
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>they're oil used to be $100 a barrel,</v>

541
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:17.781
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

542
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 2>$47 a barrel or something.</v>

543
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying is that that's how oil is priced.</v>

544
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.000
<v Speaker 2>That's helped design.</v>

545
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.521
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about,</v>

546
00:15:24.521 --> 00:15:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I know this,</v>

547
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 2>if an organism called the world economy called the u s economy,</v>

548
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 2>where there are so many different moving parts and so many different competing</v>

549
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:33.254
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

550
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.621
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

551
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:38.621
<v Speaker 2>say that one group of seven men or whoever they might be or 21 men controls</v>

552
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 2>things is holding the strings is Hollywood movie stuff.</v>

553
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 2>It would be impossible.</v>

554
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to control anything.</v>

555
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Even in Washington,</v>

556
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:49.540
<v Speaker 2>it's such a chaos fuck job.</v>

557
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 2>So when you are so far on the other Goddamn side,</v>

558
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.243
<v Speaker 2>there's an unknown.</v>

559
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.620
<v Speaker 2>The dudes in the middle there somewhere we'll rolling.</v>

560
00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible,</v>

561
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 2>but I mean people have influenced people like the people that run the World</v>

562
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:03.381
<v Speaker 2>Bank,</v>

563
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 2>people that have massive influence over just enormous sums of money.</v>

564
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think it's possible they can have some influence due to the</v>

565
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the shrine?</v>

566
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.650
<v Speaker 2>They all try and they try to have some [inaudible] at the top,</v>

567
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 2>but he knows what's going on.</v>

568
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:19.890
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is that it,</v>

569
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.500
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

570
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:20.830
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

571
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 2>they're competing with each other.</v>

572
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.620
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different competing.</v>

573
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

574
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the issue.</v>

575
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.370
<v Speaker 2>The World Bank is a massive bureaucracy.</v>

576
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

577
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.280
<v Speaker 2>the IMF has a massive bureaucracy.</v>

578
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

579
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

580
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I completely understand.</v>

581
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.811
<v Speaker 2>I think there,</v>

582
00:16:33.811 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some sort of control and manipulation involved.</v>

583
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

584
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.973
<v Speaker 2>let me give you an example.</v>

585
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 2>So let's say let's take the,</v>

586
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.331
<v Speaker 2>let's take the,</v>

587
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:42.320
<v Speaker 2>let's take the division.</v>

588
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

589
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.060
<v Speaker 2>let's take the Latin American Bank,</v>

590
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

591
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

592
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a subsidiary of the World Bank,</v>

593
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.231
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

594
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:51.500
<v Speaker 2>And I sat next to this guy on the plane and talked to him and he said that so</v>

595
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 2>much of them,</v>

596
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.440
<v Speaker 2>the sort of projects and the money,</v>

597
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 2>what they were there for was to essentially invest,</v>

598
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:57.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

599
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 2>give investments.</v>

600
00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

601
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 2>give money to investments in the Latin American economy,</v>

602
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

603
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.840
<v Speaker 2>to build up the Latin American economy in one way or another.</v>

604
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 2>And I'm generalizing,</v>

605
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 2>what happens sometimes is that that bank no longer becomes necessary because the</v>

606
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 2>economy of Latin America,</v>

607
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:13.791
<v Speaker 2>whatever that country is,</v>

608
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:14.624
<v Speaker 2>is running on its own.</v>

609
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 2>So now here's a conspiracy for you,</v>

610
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:17.294
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense.</v>

611
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

612
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.341
<v Speaker 2>but now they go,</v>

613
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:19.611
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

614
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:23.060
<v Speaker 2>well we got 3,500 people who are working at the bank,</v>

615
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 2>the Latin American Bank.</v>

616
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.100
<v Speaker 2>If there's nothing,</v>

617
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 2>if there's nothing left for them to do,</v>

618
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>we've got to come up with something that for them to do and they might,</v>

619
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 2>they now they have a vested interest in staying in business because he had 3,500</v>

620
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 2>people whose jobs are at stake now.</v>

621
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 2>You can come up with projects that are fake or you'll like,</v>

622
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you guys still need us,</v>

623
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:40.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

624
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:41.660
<v Speaker 2>because we should do this and that.</v>

625
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.310
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

626
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:43.941
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>

627
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call that conspiracy theory,</v>

628
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I would call that people who are just want to hold onto their jobs.</v>

629
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 2>And do you come up with reasons to exist?</v>

630
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what operation mockingbird is?</v>

631
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

632
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.920

633
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Of course she don't.</v>

634

<v Speaker 2>I don't buy</v>

635
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 2>because if you did you wouldn't be saying all that shit that,</v>

636
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.930
<v Speaker 2>did you hear what I said?</v>

637
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Did I say anything that has any real idea?</v>

638
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:03.121
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck you said?</v>

639

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 2>So good fight to the operation.</v>

642
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:10.794
<v Speaker 2>Mockingbird.</v>

643
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>You're strong.</v>

644
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Where can I look that up?</v>

645
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.763

647
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.720

<v Speaker 2>So it up to him.</v>

649
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:19.921
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

650
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Why do you believe she,</v>

651
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:21.751
<v Speaker 2>we know.</v>

652
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 2>What operation do you believe in all these conspiracy theories like operation</v>

653
00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.553
<v Speaker 2>mockingbird.</v>

654
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe documentary on Youtube over the economist?</v>

655
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:33.331
<v Speaker 2>Why would you believe?</v>

656
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:34.111
<v Speaker 2>And you don't even know who made it,</v>

657
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but you believe in a documentary versus talking about some shit you've never</v>

658
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:39.361
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

659
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Just because it's on youtube.</v>

660
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not real.</v>

661
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:42.984
<v Speaker 2>It's on youtube.</v>

662
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about about this documentary that</v>

663
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:48.290
<v Speaker 2>you believe that document.</v>

664
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what it is you believe that has really no.</v>

665
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you why you were being seen it.</v>

666
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Why do you believe and I think people talk.</v>

667
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.321
<v Speaker 2>There's evidence.</v>

668
00:18:58.321 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I see the evidence.</v>

669
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't read about it.</v>

670
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I see him stepping in as you both have your friends.</v>

671
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>We've gotten so crazy here that you guys are arguing and we haven't even</v>

672
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 2>discussed what this movie's about.</v>

673
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Like it hasn't even been whether or not it is a operation mockingbird,</v>

674
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 2>whether it was a conspiracy theory or whether it was a real event.</v>

675
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even discuss what it is and you guys are at each other's throats.</v>

676
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy.</v>

677
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean we didn't,</v>

678
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.700

720
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Shit that you've never done when you actually,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and control communism infiltration.</v>

725
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.443
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 4>a broadcasting companies and they wanted to own the media.</v>

727
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to magazines,</v>

728
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 4>newspapers,</v>

729
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 4>CNN is part of that shit.</v>

730
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Cooper is admitted a CIA agent.</v>

731
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.711
<v Speaker 4>He admits it.</v>

00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:08.951
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 4>he actually worked for them like when he was in college.</v>

737
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:15.380
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was?</v>

738
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 4>It did when you're in your internship or something like that to go to the CIA</v>

739
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 4>college to be a CIA agent?</v>

740
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

741
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

742
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

743
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Speaker 4>They make random internationally.</v>

744
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.540
<v Speaker 4>CIA and it's,</v>

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 4>Uber is not a CIA agent.</v>

746
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 4>He could look into it.</v>

747
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Guys looking for the CIA.</v>

748
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 4>CIA had had to do some operation mockingbird.</v>

749
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 4>We're going to control the media.</v>

750
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 4>You buy into the media.</v>

751
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.690
<v Speaker 4>That's why you don't know about operation mockingbird.</v>

752
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 4>You've been caught</v>

753
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:44.870
<v Speaker 4>in the media.</v>

754
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

755
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 4>They got you strong song a long time ago.</v>

756
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 4>Metro pro vaccine,</v>

757
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:50.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

758
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.401
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

759
00:21:50.401 --> 00:21:51.234
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

760
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.210
<v Speaker 4>You're anti vaccine all the,</v>

761
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.093
<v Speaker 4>all the way across.</v>

762
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

763
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Have you not,</v>

764
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.790
<v Speaker 4>not where for smallpox to theory and measles and all the things and mumps</v>

765
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 4>seems aren't the same.</v>

766
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 4>So when you talk about vaccines,</v>

767
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.831
<v Speaker 4>they're not all the same.</v>

768
00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

769
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.933
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>

770
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

771
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 4>can be safe and some can be dangerous school.</v>

772
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:10.220
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

773
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:10.561
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

774
00:22:10.561 --> 00:22:11.051
<v Speaker 4>I can understand.</v>

775
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 4>That's all I'm going to say about that.</v>

776
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.610
<v Speaker 4>That's a reasonable thing with any of that.</v>

777
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Many doctors agree on that.</v>

778
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

779
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 4>You know what happened in 1986 Ronald Reagan signed a bill that made big Pharma</v>

780
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 4>immune to lawsuits because big Pharma was about to say,</v>

781
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 4>fuck making vaccines.</v>

782
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Too many people are suing us,</v>

783
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.970
<v Speaker 4>so Ronald Reagan had to come and say,</v>

784
00:22:30.971 --> 00:22:32.140
<v Speaker 4>keep making them all.</v>

785
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Make a bill where no one can see you want to be.</v>

786
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.291
<v Speaker 4>They can't be sued.</v>

787
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:35.561
<v Speaker 4>That didn't,</v>

788
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 4>they can't be sued.</v>

789
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 4>They can't be sued if Pharma gets sick all the time.</v>

790
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Folks for vaccines,</v>

791
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.783
<v Speaker 4>vaccines,</v>

792
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.200
<v Speaker 4>they can't get sued for vaccines.</v>

793
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 4>If you want to sue anybody for vaccines or a kid gets fucked up from vaccines,</v>

794
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 4>you go to the vaccine court.</v>

795
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

796
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.630
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

797
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 4>it's a federal agency where they give out,</v>

798
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many fucking buildings that damn don't have allergic reactions</v>

799
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 4>to vaccines of course reactions,</v>

800
00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:59.523
<v Speaker 4>but you can't,</v>

801
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.630
<v Speaker 4>but since 1986 what happened is since 1986 since big Pharma said,</v>

802
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:05.170
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

803
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.040
<v Speaker 4>we can't get sued.</v>

804
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 4>That's when if you actually look at that,</v>

805
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 4>things are not just go hook polio.</v>

806
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 4>What about Polo?</v>

807
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 4>What about smallpox?</v>

808
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.550
<v Speaker 4>When you look at what happened,</v>

809
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.000
<v Speaker 4>they fucking greenlit.</v>

810
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 4>They're like each vaccines cause you can make truly in dog.</v>

811
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.253
<v Speaker 4>And they went,</v>

812
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.640
<v Speaker 4>so now the kid can bless his shot.</v>

813
00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:22.210
<v Speaker 4>64 it's crazy.</v>

814
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.341
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

815
00:23:22.341 --> 00:23:22.760
<v Speaker 4>no but that,</v>

816
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.300
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

817
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 4>that's the prize mode.</v>

818
00:23:24.631 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>

819
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.320
<v Speaker 4>So so,</v>

820
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 4>so that would make sense.</v>

821
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:27.371
<v Speaker 4>So if you said to me,</v>

822
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:28.204
<v Speaker 4>hey bri,</v>

823
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.021
<v Speaker 4>the once,</v>

824
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:32.230
<v Speaker 4>once the pharmaceutical companies saw that there was a lot of money in getting</v>

825
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

826
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 4>preventative vaccines and it goes up to 64 when it used to be six or 10 or</v>

827
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:38.050
<v Speaker 4>whatever when I was a kid.</v>

828
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

829
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:39.843
<v Speaker 4>now you go,</v>

830
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 4>oh well that makes sense.</v>

831
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Because what is big?</v>

832
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:44.470
<v Speaker 4>What does big Pharma do?</v>

833
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 4>They manipulate the</v>

834
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.431
<v Speaker 2>FDA.</v>

835
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:47.830
<v Speaker 2>They manipulate government.</v>

836
00:23:47.831 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 2>CDC,</v>

837
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.861
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

838
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 2>They all this so that they write so that they can be saying something very much</v>

839
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 2>like you can spirit slow</v>

840
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 2>down switch teams</v>

841
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.690
<v Speaker 2>in a CIA operation.</v>

842
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Mockingbird.</v>

843
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not conspiracy.</v>

844
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.440
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

845
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense from a business point of view,</v>

846
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:11.721
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

847
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:11.991
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

848
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>which I can understand is insidious.</v>

849
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.380
<v Speaker 2>When you have huge corporations in cahoots with government can't fucking</v>

850
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.450
<v Speaker 2>vaccines are dangerous and shit,</v>

851
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 2>they don't care.</v>

852
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 2>And we can't get sued.</v>

853
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.330
<v Speaker 2>White tests that green.</v>

854
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.880
<v Speaker 2>They're convincing the sea CDC with money.</v>

855
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Hey pass this motherfucker.</v>

856
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Really Quaker points for using in cahoots in a sentence correctly.</v>

857
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:31.970
<v Speaker 2>5,000 points.</v>

858
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just common sense,</v>

859
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.860
<v Speaker 2>common sense.</v>

860
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

861
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 2>They own the media.</v>

862
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't think the fucking people that run shit on the media,</v>

863
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.130
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be an idiot to fucking nothing.</v>

864
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>The people that run shit own the media on entertainment,</v>

865
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.540
<v Speaker 2>on everything we can cousin gangster</v>

866
00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 2>shit don't on the fucking need and you don't own the TV.</v>

867
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean that you can't get credible information on a lot of topics like the</v>

868
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:01.911
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>

869
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 2>like the war,</v>

870
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:03.584
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

871
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 2>If you know where to look,</v>

872
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you can't get credible information on the number set of what's</v>

873
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:09.481
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

874
00:25:09.481 --> 00:25:10.314
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

875
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 2>But Eddie's port Washington Post is that the control all that,</v>

876
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 2>the main stream media is all controlled.</v>

877
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 2>That ain't real shit.</v>

878
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 2>That's all controlled as part of the agenda.</v>

879
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 2>It's all slowly inch by inch,</v>

880
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 2>take away the guns and that's fucking,</v>

881
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 2>that's control everybody and implode economies fucking start civil wars.</v>

882
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Like love that chat.</v>

883
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they liked that.</v>

884
00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:40.121
<v Speaker 2>I think that the love that you said to me that the mainstream media and on</v>

885
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:45.310
<v Speaker 2>whether it's on the right or the left has agendas and has been corrupted and has</v>

886
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:50.411
<v Speaker 2>allowed their own personal points of view to infiltrate the news and so report</v>

887
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 2>on fairly and so report in a bias fashion and the news is no longer,</v>

888
00:25:57.021 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I said Jack active as it was or should be now.</v>

889
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.333
<v Speaker 2>Now that makes sense.</v>

890
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 2>If you say for example,</v>

891
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:07.691
<v Speaker 2>that gt or GE owns certain news organizations and that's a conflict of it or</v>

892
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 2>could be a conflict of interest and we have to be very careful because they may</v>

893
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>not report on ges practices.</v>

894
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 2>If they're irresponsible.</v>

895
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Now I can have a conversation because that would make sense to me.</v>

896
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 2>That would make sense because,</v>

897
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:21.830
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

898
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 2>when you say that everybody in the New York Times the Washington Post,</v>

899
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a CIA once you know this is what I'm saying.</v>

900
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 2>There's an operation that the CIA is not a conspiracy theory,</v>

901
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:32.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

902
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Operation Mockingbird,</v>

903
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:39.180
<v Speaker 2>they operation paperclip taken all the Nazis after World War II,</v>

904
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 2>operation paperclip taking thousands of Nazi into</v>

905
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 4>the government and creating NASA,</v>

906
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 4>NASA,</v>

907
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Nazi scientists,</v>

908
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.470
<v Speaker 4>and you believe this,</v>

909
00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 4>they're masters of propaganda.</v>

910
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.070
<v Speaker 4>The Nazis were masters.</v>

911
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 4>They put out films just to get people get they just to get people,</v>

912
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 4>the people to get used to killing people.</v>

913
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 4>Like if there were a certain condition,</v>

914
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.630
<v Speaker 4>they put out propaganda films and go watch this shit of a deranged people on the</v>

915
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 4>street killing people.</v>

916
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 4>People thought they would watch these news reels and they thought there was</v>

917
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 4>demented people on the streets killing people.</v>

918
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 4>And that was never happening.</v>

919
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted the people to agree that we can kill those people.</v>

920
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

921
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

922
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Cause they're crazy.</v>

923
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 4>They're no one's killing anybody,</v>

924
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:28.610
<v Speaker 4>but it was all part of a propaganda gender.</v>

925
00:27:28.611 --> 00:27:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Have</v>

926
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 3>a little perspective on that.</v>

927
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 3>So Einstein came from Germany and a lot of the Jewish scientists and the 30s</v>

928
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 3>when there was this rise of antisemitism,</v>

929
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Speaker 3>migrated,</v>

930
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 3>immigrated to the United States.</v>

931
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.160
<v Speaker 3>What about the Nazis to the operation?</v>

932
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Paperclip was now,</v>

933
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.600
<v Speaker 3>and then when we realize that the Nazis were very close to creating a nuclear</v>

934
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:48.811
<v Speaker 3>bomb,</v>

935
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 3>that they had some really amazing scientists.</v>

936
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.351
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

937
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:52.540
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

938
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.700
<v Speaker 3>they knew a lot of stuff that,</v>

939
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:54.061
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

940
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:55.590
<v Speaker 3>There was a real scientific tradition.</v>

941
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Remember where,</v>

942
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.560
<v Speaker 3>that's where Einstein came out of a lot of,</v>

943
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

944
00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

945
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.040
<v Speaker 3>the antisemitism that rose up in the 30s is y w a lot of historians have</v>

946
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:08.310
<v Speaker 3>credited the United StatesStates' ability to create a nuclear bomb before the</v>

947
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Nazis because of that immigration.</v>

948
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 3>So antisemitism in Germany actually pushed a lot of these brilliant scientists</v>

949
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.820
<v Speaker 3>toward the UK,</v>

950
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 3>toward the United States.</v>

951
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Didn't a bunch of the Nazi guys go to a Russia as well go the Russian special</v>

952
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

953
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.160
<v Speaker 3>half of them went to the state,</v>

954
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 3>probably will probably when Russia took,</v>

955
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 3>took half of Germany,</v>

956
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.030
<v Speaker 3>remember?</v>

957
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.130
<v Speaker 3>So there was east Berlin and West that was,</v>

958
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:32.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

959
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.911
<v Speaker 3>east Germany,</v>

960
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:33.511
<v Speaker 3>west Germany.</v>

961
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:34.110
<v Speaker 3>So when they,</v>

962
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.270
<v Speaker 3>when they took his Germany,</v>

963
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 3>nobody's getting out of East Germany.</v>

964
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.500
<v Speaker 3>It was understandably.</v>

965
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:37.771
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

966
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:38.211
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

967
00:28:38.211 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be intelligent,</v>

968
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 3>pragmatic,</v>

969
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 3>and the war is essentially over right,</v>

970
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 3>it's understandable to want to get their brightest minds of course,</v>

971
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 3>and bring them over.</v>

972
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

973
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 3>you've already conquered them,</v>

974
00:28:49.111 --> 00:28:49.351
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

975
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:54.351
<v Speaker 3>This is post World War II till to let them linger and become used by the</v>

976
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:56.730
<v Speaker 3>establishment that you just defeated.</v>

977
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:57.863
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

978
00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 3>These are super geniuses.</v>

979
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.080
<v Speaker 3>If you're a genius dude,</v>

980
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:01.910
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>

981
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:02.780
<v Speaker 3>but torturing,</v>

982
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.980
<v Speaker 3>experimenting on these physicists,</v>

983
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.080
<v Speaker 3>sociopath.</v>

984
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 3>If we don't listen,</v>

985
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>

986
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 3>We don't know,</v>

987
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.190
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if Wernher von Braun,</v>

988
00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 3>who was the head of NASA,</v>

989
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 3>they've Wernher von Braun was alive today,</v>

990
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.150
<v Speaker 3>they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity because he was instrumental</v>

991
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 3>in coming up with weaponry that killed a lot of,</v>

992
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

993
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.133
<v Speaker 3>the allies.</v>

994
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.771
<v Speaker 3>It was that.</v>

995
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:30.771
<v Speaker 3>It was also that they hung the five SLU slow as Jews every day in front of his</v>

996
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:32.190
<v Speaker 3>rocket factory.</v>

997
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Berlin,</v>

998
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.910
<v Speaker 3>the ones who work the same motivations.</v>

999
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:35.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 3>they would hang them.</v>

1001
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.700
<v Speaker 3>These guys remembered these guys who lived in [inaudible],</v>

1002
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 3>the guys who lived in Miami,</v>

1003
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.460
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

1004
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:44.750
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

1005
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 3>hurry in the concentration camps,</v>

1006
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 3>they interviewed him for this documentary on,</v>

1007
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 3>on the moon landings and NASA and all the scientists stood behind it and they</v>

1008
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 3>were saying like that.</v>

1009
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.210
<v Speaker 3>They would see those guys come in.</v>

1010
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 3>They would see those scientists come in and they would hang the five slow as</v>

1011
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Jews in front of the building.</v>

1012
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Those are the guys that say the least of what went on in Nazi Germany.</v>

1013
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:05.741
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1014
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1015
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:06.941
<v Speaker 3>We don't know,</v>

1016
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:07.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1017
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>

1018
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:08.791
<v Speaker 3>When I studied,</v>

1019
00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 3>that was my area of focus in my mind.</v>

1020
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Straight history majors and history majors.</v>

1021
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 3>That was my area of focus.</v>

1022
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Not too dry.</v>

1023
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm wrong about the Nazis and I'm wrong,</v>

1024
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 3>but they seem like they were fucking sick,</v>

1025
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.520
<v Speaker 3>twisted motherfuckers.</v>

1026
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.121
<v Speaker 3>That's what they see,</v>

1027
00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:23.954
<v Speaker 3>what they were,</v>

1028
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.963
<v Speaker 3>but maybe they weren't.</v>

1029
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're right.</v>

1030
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we was saying they weren't.</v>

1031
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.740
<v Speaker 3>You were calling him amazing and geniuses.</v>

1032
00:30:28.741 --> 00:30:28.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1033
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.201
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1034
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:29.411
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1035
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:29.621
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1036
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:29.771
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1037
00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:34.350
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the scientists talking about the site,</v>

1038
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:38.250
<v Speaker 3>like the [inaudible],</v>

1039
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.180
<v Speaker 3>the program programs.</v>

1040
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Hold on it.</v>

1041
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.590
<v Speaker 3>There's different scientists that are the medical scientist versus different</v>

1042
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 3>scientists that are engineers versus different scientists that are working</v>

1043
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 3>towards nuclear weapons.</v>

1044
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 3>But they were part,</v>

1045
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.680
<v Speaker 3>they were though that,</v>

1046
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.721
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1047
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:52.991
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

1048
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:53.201
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

1049
00:30:53.201 --> 00:30:54.001
<v Speaker 3>many of the sizes,</v>

1050
00:30:54.001 --> 00:30:54.834
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>

1051
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.050
<v Speaker 3>and they weren't killed because they were instrumental date.</v>

1052
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.421
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't,</v>

1053
00:30:57.421 --> 00:30:58.181
<v Speaker 3>they were too valuable.</v>

1054
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1055
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 3>NASA is fine.</v>

1056
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of them are fine.</v>

1057
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1058
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.790
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the inventions that were made by like the f,</v>

1059
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.990
<v Speaker 3>the hybrid method that was made by a guy who was a Jewish guy,</v>

1060
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.400
<v Speaker 3>which is a crazy story.</v>

1061
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 3>He also created something called [inaudible] a,</v>

1062
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 3>which had,</v>

1063
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 3>it was a gas that has a smell added to it.</v>

1064
00:31:16.571 --> 00:31:19.030
<v Speaker 3>So it would warn you that the gas was presence.</v>

1065
00:31:19.031 --> 00:31:19.530
<v Speaker 3>And then secondly,</v>

1066
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.650
<v Speaker 3>the night the Nazi.</v>

1067
00:31:20.651 --> 00:31:21.151
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1068
00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Speaker 3>And the Nazis took it and they switched to design clon B.</v>

1069
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.520
<v Speaker 3>They took the smell out of it so that you wouldn't smell it.</v>

1070
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 3>And then they use it in the gas chamber.</v>

1071
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 3>So this guy who invented the harbor method where 50% of the nitrogen that's in</v>

1072
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:35.870
<v Speaker 3>most of the human beings on the planet earth comes from because that's where it,</v>

1073
00:31:35.871 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 3>because nitrogen is how you fertilize.</v>

1074
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 3>He'd create fertilizer and this guy figured out how to draw nitrogen out from</v>

1075
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:41.291
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere.</v>

1076
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:42.700
<v Speaker 3>But this is how complicated he was.</v>

1077
00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:45.130
<v Speaker 3>He's a Jewish guy and he,</v>

1078
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 3>while he was like winning the,</v>

1079
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was a Nobel prize for the harbor method,</v>

1080
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 3>he was also being wanted for crimes against humanity because he figured out how</v>

1081
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:56.430
<v Speaker 3>to gas people too.</v>

1082
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.610
<v Speaker 3>So this was like one,</v>

1083
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 3>because he was a German patriot.</v>

1084
00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 3>I exactly,</v>

1085
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.131
<v Speaker 3>and he was,</v>

1086
00:32:00.131 --> 00:32:01.780
<v Speaker 3>there was a war going on and he would,</v>

1087
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:04.810
<v Speaker 3>they were using gas warfare for the first time when the allies,</v>

1088
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.730
<v Speaker 3>so the same time that he created this method that's going to like double the</v>

1089
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:10.750
<v Speaker 3>population of the world,</v>

1090
00:32:10.751 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 3>like sack a lot of lives,</v>

1091
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.480
<v Speaker 3>people from starvation during the winter.</v>

1092
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:13.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1093
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 3>there's so much more food available now because most people don't know,</v>

1094
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:20.250
<v Speaker 3>like you gotta throw something into the ground in order for the,</v>

1095
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.960
<v Speaker 3>the soil to you.</v>

1096
00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be a cycle.</v>

1097
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Things are supposed to die on it.</v>

1098
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Those things like get absorbed.</v>

1099
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>The cert cycle of the soil.</v>

1100
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:29.860
<v Speaker 3>The soil is nutrient rich,</v>

1101
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.061
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>

1102
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Speaker 3>healthy plants grow from it,</v>

1103
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.520
<v Speaker 3>but when you just keep putting corn in the same spot over and over and over</v>

1104
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:37.060
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1105
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you got to throw some shit into the soil and Fritz</v>

1106
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.390
<v Speaker 2>harbor figured out how to get it out of the air itself because the air is like</v>

1107
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 2>80% nitrogen.</v>

1108
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.130
<v Speaker 2>You think of the air as being mostly oxygen,</v>

1109
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:49.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:32:49.651 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 2>you think oxygen and carbon dioxide.</v>

1111
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:51.771
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1112
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:53.860
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly nitrogen is.</v>

1113
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 2>That's most of what's it.</v>

1114
00:32:54.861 --> 00:32:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So this guy is a revolving line or the Internet now that was on [inaudible].</v>

1115
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 2>This is just the fact to read that I saw her radio lab,</v>

1116
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:06.500
<v Speaker 2>but then I've read it all over the place on the internet or in the library.</v>

1117
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.753
<v Speaker 2>I read on the Internet.</v>

1118
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

1119
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.163
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>

1120
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>

1121
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1122
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.690
<v Speaker 2>this hobble,</v>

1123
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1124
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.233
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

1125
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.630
<v Speaker 2>just think about what I don't forget about like pumps.</v>

1126
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Making a nonsense for a second.</v>

1127
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Just think about what a genius you have to be to figure out how to pull nitrogen</v>

1128
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.910
<v Speaker 2>out of the air and put it in the soil and all of a sudden everything grows</v>

1129
00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1130
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Smart Dude.</v>

1131
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 2>But what's also amazing is that how complicated human beings are,</v>

1132
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:32.090
<v Speaker 2>because it raises some really interesting questions.</v>

1133
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.550
<v Speaker 2>The guy who invents the gas that was used on the Jews,</v>

1134
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:35.384
<v Speaker 2>his own people,</v>

1135
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.950
<v Speaker 2>however he was,</v>

1136
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 2>he invented chemical weaponry because he was a German patriot and wanted Germany</v>

1137
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:43.970
<v Speaker 2>to win World War One and said,</v>

1138
00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a better way to do this.</v>

1139
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 2>And so you put yourself in his position.</v>

1140
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:47.901
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

1141
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>it's it,</v>

1142
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 2>it raised a lot of difficult questions.</v>

1143
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1144
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Well he was a super complicated person.</v>

1145
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1146
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 2>But as,</v>

1147
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.740
<v Speaker 2>as are we only,</v>

1148
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 2>and like many geniuses,</v>

1149
00:33:56.631 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 2>many like really fucking smart people like that are fucking very complicated.</v>

1150
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Why did,</v>

1151
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.181
<v Speaker 2>why did,</v>

1152
00:34:02.181 --> 00:34:02.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1153
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 2>why didn't the Nazis just shoot the Jews,</v>

1154
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:08.380
<v Speaker 2>like line them up and just shoot?</v>

1155
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>

1156
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.310
<v Speaker 2>They did a lot of 6 million.</v>

1157
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Why would they bother gas?</v>

1158
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.980
<v Speaker 2>And then they got to drag them out,</v>

1159
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.200
<v Speaker 2>put him in the shower.</v>

1160
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 2>They did a lot of different things.</v>

1161
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Put them in a storm.</v>

1162
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.720
<v Speaker 2>they did a lot of different [inaudible] the gas them and then they all die.</v>

1164
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.190
<v Speaker 2>And then who's going to drag them out?</v>

1165
00:34:22.191 --> 00:34:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1166
00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 2>if you ever seen drags him out,</v>

1167
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.430
<v Speaker 2>heavy boy ever happened?</v>

1169
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:26.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1170
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

1171
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.580
<v Speaker 2>why am I just shoot?</v>

1172
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:29.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1173
00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:30.014
<v Speaker 2>he's saying why?</v>

1174
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought like they did shoot him.</v>

1175
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:36.810
<v Speaker 2>They slid a lot of and perverted and twisted psychos.</v>

1176
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1177
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Why gas shoot him when they got,</v>

1178
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times when they gassed him,</v>

1179
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:43.160
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know they were getting guests to.</v>

1180
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Does that make any sense?</v>

1181
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Why not just shoot them,</v>

1182
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.951
<v Speaker 2>drag them out.</v>

1183
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 2>So can I like Mexicans is the way they do it.</v>

1184
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They dig a big ass fucking hall with,</v>

1185
00:34:49.781 --> 00:34:49.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1186
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:50.470
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

1187
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1188
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 2>abdominal cocktails and then they just line them up.</v>

1189
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.260
<v Speaker 2>But you know what they did got to clean up that they can about that they're</v>

1190
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:56.780
<v Speaker 2>going ahead.</v>

1191
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.690
<v Speaker 2>But they did that in the Russian countryside.</v>

1192
00:34:58.691 --> 00:34:58.870
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>

1193
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 2>you can see video of it.</v>

1194
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1195
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.580
<v Speaker 2>they dug massive graves and they would,</v>

1196
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.200
<v Speaker 2>they'd make them dig their own graves and then they would just show him smart.</v>

1197
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.651
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

1198
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 2>what happens when they drag him out of the shower,</v>

1199
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 2>when they got chemicals,</v>

1200
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.701
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1201
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:13.970
<v Speaker 2>what they would do is when they would bring them on the trains to Auschwitz,</v>

1202
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:16.760
<v Speaker 2>triplink and Dachau and all the different death camps,</v>

1203
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:17.810
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't,</v>

1204
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:18.980
<v Speaker 2>if they started lining people up,</v>

1205
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:19.814
<v Speaker 2>what would happen?</v>

1206
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Especially women and children hysteria.</v>

1207
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 2>So what they said is they get off the train after this horrible train ride and</v>

1208
00:35:25.431 --> 00:35:25.701
<v Speaker 2>they'd say,</v>

1209
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 2>here's a bar of soap.</v>

1210
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take a shower.</v>

1211
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>That they put them all in tourism and they trick them.</v>

1212
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:32.510
<v Speaker 2>They'd be in these showers,</v>

1213
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:33.350
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote showers,</v>

1214
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:34.184
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>

1215
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:35.361
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

1216
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Some take shower and some would be killed.</v>

1217
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1218
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't know.</v>

1219
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.440
<v Speaker 3>So the strong,</v>

1220
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 3>so they mix it up.</v>

1221
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 3>The ones that look strong,</v>

1222
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:42.751
<v Speaker 3>they could,</v>

1223
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 3>they could use for work,</v>

1224
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:44.791
<v Speaker 3>they would work.</v>

1225
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:44.901
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1226
00:35:44.901 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1227
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 3>and the ones who are children went right away.</v>

1228
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.090
<v Speaker 3>They don't teach ELA gassing seems so twisted it in.</v>

1229
00:35:50.091 --> 00:35:51.740
<v Speaker 3>So why not just make,</v>

1230
00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 3>did a lot of horrible things.</v>

1231
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:55.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about,</v>

1232
00:35:55.551 --> 00:35:55.681
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1233
00:35:55.681 --> 00:35:56.710
<v Speaker 3>No doubts,</v>

1234
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.303
<v Speaker 3>no words you're saying,</v>

1235
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.473
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>

1236
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Gas To kill Jesus.</v>

1237
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1238
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.410
<v Speaker 3>but there's a difference between the,</v>

1239
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be a difference between concentration camp guards and</v>

1240
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:10.400
<v Speaker 3>scientists signed off,</v>

1241
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 3>but that's the same thing as us.</v>

1242
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying that you as a martial artist,</v>

1243
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 3>you train people out of fight.</v>

1244
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.830
<v Speaker 3>You probably have some connection with someone who was a corrections officer.</v>

1245
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's,</v>

1246
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.680
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying though?</v>

1247
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.150
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

1248
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1249
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.270
<v Speaker 3>but how much do you have a an effect of what they do with their life.</v>

1250
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 3>The people who are working in the Er as a corrections officers are probably,</v>

1251
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.801
<v Speaker 3>or the the,</v>

1252
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:36.150
<v Speaker 3>the guards rather at Auschwitz or probably so far removed from the fucking</v>

1253
00:36:36.151 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 3>scientists.</v>

1254
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they all get together and go,</v>

1255
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.271
<v Speaker 3>we're all evil,</v>

1256
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:39.601
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1257
00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:39.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:41.170
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing today for evil?</v>

1259
00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm torturing the Jews.</v>

1260
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.193
<v Speaker 3>Evil,</v>

1261
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 3>all of those signs.</v>

1262
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:47.971
<v Speaker 3>A percent.</v>

1263
00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I'm saying now.</v>

1264
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100% they're all,</v>

1265
00:36:50.221 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 3>anybody who subscribed to that ideology is evil.</v>

1266
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Cost Eddie.</v>

1267
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Eddie.</v>

1268
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Eddie was just like,</v>

1269
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 3>please no please.</v>

1270
00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1271
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.391
<v Speaker 3>no Eddie.</v>

1272
00:36:57.391 --> 00:36:57.940
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

1273
00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.441
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>

1274
00:36:58.441 --> 00:36:59.700
<v Speaker 3>The scientist didn't have a choice.</v>

1275
00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:00.630
<v Speaker 3>They had to work you.</v>

1276
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:00.851
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1277
00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.101
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1278
00:37:01.101 --> 00:37:02.820
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't say it to the Hitler,</v>

1279
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 3>the Nazi regime.</v>

1280
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Hey guys,</v>

1281
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to work on your super bomb.</v>

1282
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.711
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>

1283
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 3>when kill you with a white with a white fucking coat on,</v>

1284
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.810
<v Speaker 3>just in front of a beaker,</v>

1285
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 3>like all day those dudes went to twist it.</v>

1286
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 3>A cultish shit.</v>

1287
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.850
<v Speaker 3>So like the ones that brought it in,</v>

1288
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.980
<v Speaker 3>maybe somebody can do it.</v>

1289
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:19.531
<v Speaker 3>Nazis.</v>

1290
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 3>It was a religion.</v>

1291
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just like,</v>

1292
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.930
<v Speaker 3>oh they had a white coat and I got them a week or two to understand if there was</v>

1293
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that we're trying to get rid of dude to want her to fuck.</v>

1294
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 3>But there was people that were trying to get rid of Hitler that thought he was</v>

1295
00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:31.081

00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:43.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1405
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.410
<v Speaker 5>the rugged handsomeness of Brett Farve just distracted me for a brief moment.</v>

1406
00:39:47.411 --> 00:39:47.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm right.</v>

1407
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.560
<v Speaker 5>Better,</v>

1408
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 5>better as he gets older,</v>

1409
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 5>he gives less of fuck.</v>

1410
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.630
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen his dick pic?</v>

1411

<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1412
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:54.183
<v Speaker 5>Not Sad.</v>

1413
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.003
<v Speaker 5>Photoshop.</v>

1414
00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 5>Hope I wouldn't allow him in the hall of fame for that came out before the hall</v>

1415
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:05.731
<v Speaker 5>of fame might be an inside joke that just no one's telling you about Naza</v>

1416
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Harari.</v>

1417
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:06.371
<v Speaker 5>He's a grower,</v>

1418
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:07.000
<v Speaker 5>not a shower.</v>

1419
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.850
<v Speaker 5>It could be any thoughts on Sun.</v>

1420
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 5>Could it had some fun?</v>

1421
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 5>It might've been part of the inside joke.</v>

1422
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.473
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1423
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 5>I beat the shit out of it right now.</v>

1424
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1425
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.180

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 5>he didn't even comment on,</v>

1427
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:18.010
<v Speaker 5>he's just get what can you do?</v>

1428
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:18.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1429
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:19.384
<v Speaker 5>That's the way to do it.</v>

1430
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 5>The best way to do it and that the best way to go scan just probably depends on</v>

1431
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:23.980
<v Speaker 5>what the scandal is.</v>

1432
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.110
<v Speaker 5>If your wiener know Anthony Wiener,</v>

1433

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes he's just like half fucking this fucking fight,</v>

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.480
<v Speaker 5>is that real?</v>

1443
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.290
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1444
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:38.660
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1445
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.493
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1446
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.530
<v Speaker 5>but you're talking about right.</v>

1447
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.850
<v Speaker 5>So it's salt.</v>

1448
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 5>It's serves its purpose.</v>

1449
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1450
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.460
<v Speaker 5>That's a fun card,</v>

1451
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1452
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.563
<v Speaker 5>It's a great car.</v>

1453
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Holloway.</v>

1454
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.220
<v Speaker 5>Nine in a row.</v>

1455
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:50.210
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Connor had to be like,</v>

1456
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going.</v>

1457
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.110
<v Speaker 5>They had to strip them of belt.</v>

1458
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 5>Then finally he gets a title shot.</v>

1459
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.630
<v Speaker 5>God Damn it.</v>

1460
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.493
<v Speaker 5>Give the,</v>

1461
00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.780
<v Speaker 5>and it's kind of a fake inter cause they're like shows.</v>

1462
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.830
<v Speaker 5>He's the champ for interim title,</v>

1463
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:03.940
<v Speaker 5>but he's the chair.</v>

1464
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.090
<v Speaker 5>Why not just give it to them?</v>

1465
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:06.550
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1466
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.911
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

1467
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:10.290
<v Speaker 5>but you already have a chance to fight for their term.</v>

1468
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:11.830
<v Speaker 5>I like belts.</v>

1469
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.301
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

1470
00:41:12.301 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 5>Let's do it.</v>

1471
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.530
<v Speaker 5>If that gets Max or empty pests.</v>

1472
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:14.891
<v Speaker 5>A belt.</v>

1473
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 5>Let's fucking ride.</v>

1474
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 5>I feel the same way.</v>

1475
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 5>I feel the same way.</v>

1476
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

1477
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.680
<v Speaker 5>I like that fight.</v>

1478
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 5>Everyone gets belts.</v>

1479
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 5>The only thing I wonder about that fight is,</v>

1480
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:24.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1481
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.460
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how well pedis is body adapted to one 45 here's the real question is</v>

1482
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:30.730
<v Speaker 5>remembered.</v>

1483
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.870
<v Speaker 5>They weren't the main event.</v>

1484
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 5>Now they are five rounds.</v>

1485
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

1486
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 1>we've seen them adapt.</v>

1487
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:35.631
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1488
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 1>With two to three rounds at 45,</v>

1489
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 1>imagine round four and five,</v>

1490
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 1>the championship rounds.</v>

1491
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Now let me ask you this,</v>

1492
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:41.773
<v Speaker 1>cause he loses weight.</v>

1493
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Is that cardio,</v>

1494
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.851
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this.</v>

1495
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:44.720
<v Speaker 1>As a guy who you,</v>

1496
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 1>have you ever fought five?</v>

1497
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.091
<v Speaker 1>Never fought five?</v>

1498
00:41:47.091 --> 00:41:47.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1499
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1500
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.063
<v Speaker 1>never fought for title.</v>

1501
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for bringing that up.</v>

1502
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:50.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1503
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.513
<v Speaker 1>Someone I met,</v>

1504
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.393
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm just kidding.</v>

1505
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 1>But do you feel that the,</v>

1506
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 1>those like when you get in shape to go a hard three,</v>

1507
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 1>how much of a difference is there between the heart three and the hard five?</v>

1508
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Is it mental like at a certain point in time,</v>

1509
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 1>how much more training?</v>

1510
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Like how much in better shape could you really get?</v>

1511
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.790
<v Speaker 1>And is it one of these things where it's just harder?</v>

1512
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1513
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.460
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be more educated.</v>

1514
00:42:12.461 --> 00:42:12.940
<v Speaker 1>The pace.</v>

1515
00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1516
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Is it just harder or is it like does it require more time to prepare for five</v>

1517
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:19.124
<v Speaker 1>rounds?</v>

1518
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So you get in peak shape,</v>

1519
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 1>no matter shape is peak shape and the differences between you just having to</v>

1520
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:25.970
<v Speaker 1>fight 15 minutes in the potential of 25?</v>

1521
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:26.391
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1522
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And that fee didn't use bar 25 minutes all the time.</v>

1523
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:29.481
<v Speaker 1>All the city.</v>

1524
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I usually do have seven rounds.</v>

1525
00:42:30.671 --> 00:42:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1526
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1527
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but the uh,</v>

1528
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1529
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 1>to your point,</v>

1530
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the pacing in the early rounds because like take for instance,</v>

1531
00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:39.051
<v Speaker 1>Brunson,</v>

1532
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:39.884
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Whittaker,</v>

1533
00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.090
<v Speaker 1>when he came out with,</v>

1534
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:41.301
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1535
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:41.961
<v Speaker 1>he's not fighting,</v>

1536
00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 1>you go five rounds.</v>

1537
00:42:42.921 --> 00:42:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just trying to get out of,</v>

1538
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.410
<v Speaker 1>to win and get out because everyone in the world knows at that level.</v>

1539
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't go for five rounds sites.</v>

1540
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.303
<v Speaker 1>Impossible.</v>

1541
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Ben's about to fight.</v>

1542
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1543
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 1>she feels like glaze and t bow and you put your hand on her shoulder.</v>

1544
00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean that in a good way.</v>

1545
00:42:58.881 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1546
00:42:59.060 --> 00:42:59.590
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1547
00:42:59.590 --> 00:42:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1548
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 1>she's such a,</v>

1549
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 1>she's a morph tank she's at,</v>

1550
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of hers girls.</v>

1551
00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:05.324
<v Speaker 1>Really strong,</v>

1552
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.340
<v Speaker 1>powerful silver medals in the Olympics too though.</v>

1553
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.313
<v Speaker 1>I hope</v>

1554
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that she said it.</v>

1555
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 1>She said she's so good at.</v>

1556
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And is there any woman that you've ever rolled with that,</v>

1557
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that gave you any kind of fits or any problem?</v>

1558
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Not to be sexist,</v>

1559
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 1>but beyond.</v>

1560
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if I rolled with Gabby Garcia,</v>

1561
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:26.300
<v Speaker 1>she'd fuck me up.</v>

1562
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.583
<v Speaker 1>Big.</v>

1563
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.283
<v Speaker 1>Heavy on you.</v>

1564
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is Davis.</v>

1565
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:33.531
<v Speaker 1>They're little.</v>

1566
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:35.210
<v Speaker 1>They're like 125 pounds.</v>

1567
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 1>135</v>

1568
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.520
<v Speaker 1>one 45 hey,</v>

1569
00:43:39.521 --> 00:43:42.140
<v Speaker 1>let me queue up the time here so we'll actually try to wash us.</v>

1570
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:47.141
<v Speaker 1>Four 402440144439 all of the first round.</v>

1571
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a Sarah McMahon versus Alexis Davis,</v>

1572
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:50.961
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1573
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that stoppage when she fought Ronda and gotten hundred percent</v>

1574
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:55.410
<v Speaker 1>legit,</v>

1575
00:43:55.410 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it was Rhonda cracked or the right hand and cracked or with a knee and then put</v>

1576
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.574
<v Speaker 1>the miniature?</v>

1577
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.013
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1578
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.100
<v Speaker 1>What effect meant McMahon develop some serious stand up.</v>

1579
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.840
<v Speaker 1>She does have good standup.</v>

1580
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 1>She just ran into the freight train.</v>

1581
00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:11.660
<v Speaker 1>That is Ronda Rousey.</v>

1582
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:12.120
<v Speaker 1>She also,</v>

1583
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.330
<v Speaker 1>she's a decent fighter round.</v>

1584
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>She does a lot of things good all around.</v>

1585
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.240

<v Speaker 3>People don't do that enough.</v>

1615
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

1616
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Why not just throw those short ELB?</v>

1619
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:05.120
<v Speaker 3>When they throw up like that.</v>

1620
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.471
<v Speaker 3>Edie.</v>

1621
00:45:05.471 --> 00:45:06.790

<v Speaker 3>Anytime Palae Landy back in the day in the late nineties and Brazil.</v>

1623
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.433
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1625
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 3>She's trapped now.</v>

1626
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Those messages up to,</v>

1627
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1628
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Instead of her being in good position,</v>

1629
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.541
<v Speaker 3>she's trapped.</v>

1630
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:19.374
<v Speaker 3>Getting elbowed.</v>

1631
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:19.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1632
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:20.610
<v Speaker 3>she's in protection mode.</v>

1633
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:20.881
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

1634
00:45:20.881 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 3>do you remember Jason Day was like one of the first guys to figure out how to do</v>

1635
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 3>that from the rubber guard?</v>

1636
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Anybody doing this situation right?</v>

1637
00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Chuck throwing elbows right now.</v>

1638
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.220
<v Speaker 3>What is she?</v>

1639
00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.380
<v Speaker 3>What Sarah McMahon do here cause she needs to pause.</v>

1640
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 3>She needs to posture up or not punch because if Alexis Davis really knew how to</v>

1641
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 3>play some high level rubber guard,</v>

1642
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:45.300
<v Speaker 3>she would never let Sara Mcmann has her hand on the mat and then have a hat on.</v>

1643
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 3>The chasse had the hand on the mat at the end of it.</v>

1644
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Once the hands on the map,</v>

1645
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:48.691
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1646
00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:49.291
<v Speaker 3>it stays there.</v>

1647
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:50.970
<v Speaker 3>We're not going back to check this out though.</v>

1648
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 3>She's about to triangle this bitch.</v>

1649
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.123
<v Speaker 3>Ah Fuck.</v>

1650
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.890
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean she has a lot of potatoes.</v>

1651
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.563
<v Speaker 3>I started</v>

1652
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.450
<v Speaker 3>about drag.</v>

1653
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.293
<v Speaker 3>I was</v>

1654
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 3>free from Fox.</v>

1655
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>You can just let those bitches loose.</v>

1656
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.030
<v Speaker 3>You got them all corralled up and your brain and come on,</v>

1657
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:14.190
<v Speaker 3>let the crowd on this side like when she on her right side,</v>

1658
00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 3>see where Sarah Mcmahon's right arm is.</v>

1659
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:17.310
<v Speaker 3>That should never be there.</v>

1660
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.130
<v Speaker 3>When your right arm is pinned to the ground like that and you have someone with</v>

1661
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 3>a strong rubber guard,</v>

1662
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 3>especially someone who has already taken mission control with that left leg up,</v>

1663
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.880
<v Speaker 3>the first thing to do is to trap that arm.</v>

1664
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 3>So once that arm is down in the ground like that,</v>

1665
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 3>you'd never want to give it back.</v>

1666
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:32.100
<v Speaker 3>And she keeps giving it back over and over and over.</v>

1667
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.580
<v Speaker 3>There's winning series winning this round gentlemen.</v>

1668
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1669
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.151
<v Speaker 3>she is.</v>

1670
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:39.140
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm saying is there's a lot of opportunities for Alexis Davis offer</v>

1671
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.410
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1672
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.551
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1673
00:46:39.551 --> 00:46:44.551
<v Speaker 3>I'm wishing every time Sara McMann puts her hand onto the the ground like that.</v>

1674
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 3>She's extremely vulnerable</v>

1675
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 3>person with a very good rubber guard.</v>

1676
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.960
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you put your arm down on the mat,</v>

1677
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.180
<v Speaker 3>they're going to immediately over hook that arm,</v>

1678
00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 3>try to trap it in place,</v>

1679
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.670
<v Speaker 3>and then try to go to mission control.</v>

1680
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 3>She achieved mission control.</v>

1681
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>She just didn't exactly know what to do once you got there.</v>

1682
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't try to progress any further.</v>

1683
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a the punches.</v>

1684
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.353
<v Speaker 3>But she,</v>

1685
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:08.761
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1686
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>if you just want to elbow someone,</v>

1687
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 3>if you watched the Allen Day are Alan Belcher.</v>

1688
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Jason Day fight.</v>

1689
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Jason Day was a,</v>

1690
00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 3>you know he beat Alan Belcher really early on when belt,</v>

1691
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm belches of fantastic fighter and he's since then</v>

1692
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.850
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1693
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Paul Harvey said his only crime game went leg lock with a the position and beat</v>

1694
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of him.</v>

1695
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 3>I love out so it's not,</v>

1696
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not a dis on Alan Belcher.</v>

1697
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:34.451
<v Speaker 3>I love that dude.</v>

1698
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 3>But Jason Day showed how effective that position could be in holding that spot</v>

1699
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 3>and blasting elbows in place.</v>

1700
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of people that use like the first couple of steps of the</v>

1701
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

1702
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 3>but they don't know high level shit from then out.</v>

1703
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a long process.</v>

1704
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like I try to shoot doubles but you don't really practice wrestling</v>

1705
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.320
<v Speaker 3>position kind of.</v>

1706
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:53.801
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1707
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:54.311
<v Speaker 3>It's like okay,</v>

1708
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I see you're trying to shoot a doubled.</v>

1709
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.091
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1710
00:47:58.091 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

1711
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 3>She was in a good position and she's so close to finishing this fight.</v>

1712
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1713
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 3>So close.</v>

1714
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:03.933
<v Speaker 3>She's got shot.</v>

1715
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:04.883
<v Speaker 3>She shouldn't hit her.</v>

1716
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.190
<v Speaker 3>She should cinch it up cause hitting.</v>

1717
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 3>There's going to bash her out and she</v>

1718
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.540
<v Speaker 3>knows she needs to pull that leg over.</v>

1719
00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 3>She's got to scoot that punchy off.</v>

1720
00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:16.151
<v Speaker 3>Don't tap.</v>

1721
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 3>You've got 10 seconds.</v>

1722
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.480
<v Speaker 3>The left light has got to be close with</v>

1723
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 3>coach Cheryl.</v>

1724
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:24.821
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1725
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:25.511
<v Speaker 3>That was phenomenal.</v>

1726
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Alexis Davis got a lot of potential offer back.</v>

1727
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:30.220
<v Speaker 3>She can be as fucking assassin.</v>

1728
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.980
<v Speaker 3>She should should've finished that.</v>

1729
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:33.814
<v Speaker 3>That was nasty.</v>

1730
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.330
<v Speaker 3>That was nasty smell.</v>

1731
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Mcmahon's what level you are with it?</v>

1732
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Like my high level rubber guard players.</v>

1733
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't last one like 30 seconds there.</v>

1734
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:43.550
<v Speaker 3>They were really rat.</v>

1735
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:44.820
<v Speaker 3>That would have all just been a wrap.</v>

1736
00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 3>You're saying pure Jujitsu guys?</v>

1737
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Pure Jujitsu.</v>

1738
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1739
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Pure.</v>

1740
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Just gut.</v>

1741
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.820
<v Speaker 3>When punches with punches it doesn't,</v>

1742
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 3>it didn't even matter what the punches.</v>

1743
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:53.524
<v Speaker 3>We'll make it easier.</v>

1744
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 3>The punches make it easier when the way you stopped Robert.</v>

1745
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Gard don't punch.</v>

1746
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 3>That's live.</v>

1747
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.950
<v Speaker 3>You wrote cop elbows you in the fucking murder.</v>

1748
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Then you,</v>

1749
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:03.160
<v Speaker 3>then you don't have,</v>

1750
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 3>then you're not in rubber guard.</v>

1751
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:04.501
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>

1752
00:49:04.501 --> 00:49:05.334
<v Speaker 3>You're not in a rubber room.</v>

1753
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 3>You can't get elbowed in rubber,</v>

1754
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 3>so you get elbowed</v>

1755
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:10.690

1756
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Talk to get a guy in rubber guard if he's aware of rubber guard.</v>

1757
00:49:12.941 --> 00:49:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1758
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And then the mayor saying once,</v>

1759

1762
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.133
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

1763
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's counters,</v>

1764
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.451
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>

1765
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 3>you just keep playing the game.</v>

1766
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:21.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying,</v>

1767
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:22.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1768
00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 3>if you try to throw that head kick due to get out of the way,</v>

1769
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1770
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:25.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1771
00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:26.441
<v Speaker 3>They'll get out of the way.</v>

1772
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:27.270
<v Speaker 3>But you still fucking,</v>

1773
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 3>there's ways to set it up.</v>

1774
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:28.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1775
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.524
<v Speaker 3>You sent it out.</v>

1776
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:30.500
<v Speaker 3>It's the same.</v>

1777
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the same.</v>

1778
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I do trust it.</v>

1779
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I got guys all they play as rubber guard and high level guys come through all</v>

1780
00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:38.830
<v Speaker 3>the time and I see it,</v>

1781
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:39.664
<v Speaker 3>I witness it.</v>

1782
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at him like I,</v>

1783
00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 3>that's all I play.</v>

1784
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:43.323
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1785
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1786
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.090
<v Speaker 3>You go home the rabbit hole.</v>

1787
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 3>You're Trump.</v>

1788
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be a cray.</v>

1789
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how crazy I would be pushing or some shit that I don't even apply to.</v>

1790
00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 3>M good leg.</v>

1791
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.360
<v Speaker 3>How crazy,</v>

1792
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.193
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1793
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.160
<v Speaker 3>It just takes a lot of time.</v>

1794
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:00.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a hell of a scram.</v>

1795
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.440
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful takedown.</v>

1796
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:03.431
<v Speaker 3>Syracuse.</v>

1797
00:50:03.431 --> 00:50:04.264
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1798
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 3>100% he invented it.</v>

1799
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:10.560
<v Speaker 3>He named it the whole deal and it was all that's innovative guys.</v>

1800
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 3>There were some guys that did some,</v>

1801
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 3>some interesting guards in the past and there was a Nieto Schembri had a lot of</v>

1802
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:17.524
<v Speaker 3>really cool stuff,</v>

1803
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:22.330
<v Speaker 3>but what Eddie did was he put together a system and especially a system that's</v>

1804
00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:24.460
<v Speaker 3>really effective Nogi and named it.</v>

1805
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1806
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.691
<v Speaker 3>well he's,</v>

1807
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:26.111
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1808
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 3>and then he came out with the Eddie Bravo and invitational,</v>

1809
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 5>which I've heard you guys say is way more exciting to last night.</v>

1810
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 5>Did you watch it?</v>

1811
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.371
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1812
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

1813
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.593
<v Speaker 5>but guy here,</v>

1814
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.850
<v Speaker 5>I like CBI here.</v>

1815
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:39.240
<v Speaker 5>Are we doing one Saturday Eddie and that on it invitational this Saturday.</v>

1816
00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

1817
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 5>look at this total potential electric chair position.</v>

1818
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:44.031
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't look.</v>

1819
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:44.291
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

1820
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:44.561
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1821
00:50:44.561 --> 00:50:45.394
<v Speaker 5>she was,</v>

1822
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.840
<v Speaker 5>she was in a position where she could have totally done it.</v>

1823
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.750
<v Speaker 5>Sarah gets serious.</v>

1824
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 5>She keeps gaze is ridiculous,</v>

1825
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:51.651
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1826
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:52.960
<v Speaker 5>Being an Olympic level wrestler,</v>

1827
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 5>that's tougher to deal with.</v>

1828
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 5>What Sara McMann needs to do is three,</v>

1829
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 5>her right knee and then go to three quarter mount.</v>

1830
00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.620
<v Speaker 5>That's all she's got to do.</v>

1831
00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 5>That's the Damien Maia route.</v>

1832
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.200
<v Speaker 5>If she's Damien Maia.</v>

1833
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:05.060
<v Speaker 5>Something else got really good control.</v>

1834
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.380
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever wrote with Damien?</v>

1835
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:07.363
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1836
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 5>He'd probably fucked me up.</v>

1837
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.580
<v Speaker 5>Always bigger than you.</v>

1838
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.911
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1839
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:11.744
<v Speaker 5>he's just,</v>

1840
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.620
<v Speaker 5>he sold like he's a man.</v>

1841
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 5>You know what I've loved about what he does.</v>

1842
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:15.381
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1843
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 5>so it's so old school,</v>

1844
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:17.211
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

1845
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:18.440
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't look like he's doing much,</v>

1846
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:19.660
<v Speaker 5>but he's on top of you back</v>

1847
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 5>cutting right through all your bullshit.</v>

1848
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:26.520
<v Speaker 5>Jibber Jabber.</v>

1849
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.380
<v Speaker 5>He's just cut through all your bullshit and putting the smashed out on.</v>

1850
00:51:30.381 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1851
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.380
<v Speaker 5>When you watch the really high level,</v>

1852
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:33.980
<v Speaker 5>high level wrestlers,</v>

1853
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing that do things to pants and do an arm drag single legs,</v>

1854
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.600
<v Speaker 5>but they're so flawless with it.</v>

1855
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.991
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1856
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 5>you know when he did it to Carlos Condit,</v>

1857
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1858
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 5>I just was shaking my head like,</v>

1859
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:43.890
<v Speaker 5>God damn everyone.</v>

1860
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh look at this man with the arm trial,</v>

1861
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:49.310
<v Speaker 5>but she's still in the guard.</v>

1862
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.440
<v Speaker 5>She's trapped into half guard.</v>

1863
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 5>It would be over here with</v>

1864
00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:55.643
<v Speaker 5>this half guard.</v>

1865
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.161
<v Speaker 5>You don't really need,</v>

1866
00:51:58.161 --> 00:51:59.140
<v Speaker 5>she could take her time here.</v>

1867
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 5>She could just wear out right here and eventually pulled out right in the out.</v>

1868
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1869
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 5>Just go to three quarter mile.</v>

1870
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.223
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what else.</v>

1871
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.770
<v Speaker 5>You didn't don't really even need a mouse.</v>

1872
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 5>She knows what's up.</v>

1873
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.123
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

1874
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:12.561

1876
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.023
<v Speaker 5>She would've just</v>

1877
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 5>held onto her leg.</v>

1878
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:28.993
<v Speaker 5>She would have been fine.</v>

1886
00:52:41.281 --> 00:52:42.230

<v Speaker 5>She's a fucking horse.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She turns it into it like I to the leg and it was done.</v>

1924
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Hold on the leg and turn away from the church.</v>

1925
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.190
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter at that point.</v>

1926
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 3>You're just like that until they let go the book.</v>

1927
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Soon as they let go of that grip,</v>

1928
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:57.520
<v Speaker 3>hold on to her leg.</v>

1929
00:53:58.650 --> 00:53:59.281
<v Speaker 3>She held on her,</v>

1930
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:00.114
<v Speaker 3>her on</v>

1931
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:02.101
<v Speaker 3>the arm.</v>

1932
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 3>That's in the choke.</v>

1933
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't want it like this.</v>

1934
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Want it like this.</v>

1935
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 3>If it's like this elbow here,</v>

1936
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>you're Gotcha.</v>

1937
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 3>If you're like this,</v>

1938
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:10.621
<v Speaker 3>you're choked.</v>

1939
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 3>So we want to do this.</v>

1940
00:54:12.871 --> 00:54:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Keeps it here.</v>

1941
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.071
<v Speaker 3>Holding her own leg.</v>

1942
00:54:14.071 --> 00:54:14.840
<v Speaker 3>You're like this.</v>

1943
00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1944
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 3>If someone does that,</v>

1945
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:17.640
<v Speaker 3>do you go to the impaler?</v>

1946
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 3>If they tried that,</v>

1947
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.970
<v Speaker 3>that defense you tried to go knee to chest?</v>

1948
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.020
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>

1949
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I always do.</v>

1950
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying was from the mount.</v>

1951
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I never let them have the opportunity to grab their leg.</v>

1952
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 3>You just take it right from the mouth.</v>

1953
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I never even leave them out because if I leave them out,</v>

1954
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:30.901
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do that.</v>

1955
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:31.471
<v Speaker 3>If you know that,</v>

1956
00:54:31.471 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 3>and if you know that defense,</v>

1957
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 3>if you know that defense,</v>

1958
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 3>it stops all arm triangle.</v>

1959
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.140
<v Speaker 3>But from the impaler I remember trying that defense.</v>

1960
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 3>That's mount,</v>

1961
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.410
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of a mountain he shored up.</v>

1962
00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 3>That knee is going to be in the way of this,</v>

1963
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:44.581
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1964
00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 3>But you can push that motherfucker out.</v>

1965
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.000
<v Speaker 3>So really the best thing to do is just do a,</v>

1966
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1967
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.660
<v Speaker 3>a amount worth,</v>

1968
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 3>kind of like me on the belly,</v>

1969
00:54:51.691 --> 00:54:53.190
<v Speaker 3>but your knees on the ground,</v>

1970
00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:54.240
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a deep,</v>

1971
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 3>and he on the belly,</v>

1972
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 3>that's the best spot right there.</v>

1973
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.600
<v Speaker 3>There's no defects which needs in the ground.</v>

1974
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Say if you're on less on the belly,</v>

1975
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1976
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.210
<v Speaker 3>Same side that she just got right.</v>

1977
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1978
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be your left knee on her belly.</v>

1979
00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1980
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 3>But instead of having the neat,</v>

1981
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 3>actually on the belly,</v>

1982
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 3>it's actually all the way through.</v>

1983
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like your Shin across the stomach.</v>

1984
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:11.281
<v Speaker 3>Knee,</v>

1985
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 3>really heavy on the map because if you had your knee on your belly and they knew</v>

1986
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 3>the defense,</v>

1987
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 3>they would fucking pop that motherfucker up and grab their leg and now they're</v>

1988
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:19.440
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1989
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.730
<v Speaker 3>And I see you have the left knee on the right side of their body and the Shin</v>

1990
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:24.570
<v Speaker 3>across the top.</v>

1991
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.060
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way they could graduate.</v>

1992
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 3>This is more of a mouse.</v>

1993
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.020
<v Speaker 3>It's more of a mouse.</v>

1994
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:28.810
<v Speaker 3>You might as well not,</v>

1995
00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but that is actually better than a mountain.</v>

1996
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Well I know when you would do it,</v>

1997
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:35.250
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you would do it and we would call the impaler.</v>

1998
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you still do that?</v>

1999
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:37.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2000
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't even need it.</v>

2001
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 3>That's terrifying because they stopped doing it.</v>

2002
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.330
<v Speaker 3>It was horrific.</v>

2003
00:55:42.331 --> 00:55:43.080
<v Speaker 3>It was just there.</v>

2004
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:43.771
<v Speaker 3>It's always there.</v>

2005
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 3>It's a need to,</v>

2006
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 3>the right to the sternum is just a massive pressure at the side choke.</v>

2007
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.690
<v Speaker 3>So you put the shy side choke in and then the knees on the sternum.</v>

2008
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 3>The sternum neck.</v>

2009
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.541
<v Speaker 3>Both,</v>

2010
00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it doesn't work on everybody,</v>

2011
00:55:57.721 --> 00:56:00.690
<v Speaker 3>but that's the best way to stop that defense.</v>

2012
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Where you grabbing the leg?</v>

2013
00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 3>For me it was always the impaler,</v>

2014
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:03.671
<v Speaker 3>the impaler.</v>

2015
00:56:03.671 --> 00:56:03.731
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2016
00:56:03.731 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 3>we stopped that because you wanted so bad to get that knee off your chest.</v>

2017
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 3>You were willing to let your legs go.</v>

2018
00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Just try to push that knee aside and then just fall right into the church.</v>

2019
00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2020
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 3>I only go to the impaler when the regular shit ain't working and he's got like a</v>

2021
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>little angle has got a little spot.</v>

2022
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not lined up perfect.</v>

2023
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.320
<v Speaker 3>So now we go,</v>

2024
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:23.741
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

2025
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Let's</v>

2026
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.220
<v Speaker 4>just hold this and drive the knee right in his neck.</v>

2027
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 4>And that's usually what makes him tap.</v>

2028
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:29.291
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2029
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 4>you did the impaler on me one time and I really thought my chest was gonna</v>

2030
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.633
<v Speaker 4>crack.</v>

2031
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 4>I thought my sternum was going to crash.</v>

2032
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:36.310
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2033
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible feeling because like someone's cranking down in your neck,</v>

2034
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:41.380
<v Speaker 4>you got a head and arm trapped in there,</v>

2035
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2036
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:45.390
<v Speaker 4>You're the arm choke in there and then they got their neat on your shift.</v>

2037
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:46.470
<v Speaker 4>It's just shit.</v>

2038
00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 4>Eddie,</v>

2039
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:50.460
<v Speaker 4>how long ago was we wrestled for a restaurant?</v>

2040
00:56:50.461 --> 00:56:51.340
<v Speaker 4>I see years.</v>

2041
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.121
<v Speaker 4>Just two years.</v>

2042
00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:53.200
<v Speaker 4>But you were going to suck.</v>

2043
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:54.400
<v Speaker 4>Really terrible.</v>

2044
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 4>I got one take them two years.</v>

2045
00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.910
<v Speaker 4>When did you realize that when you started rolling and Jujitsu,</v>

2046
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.190
<v Speaker 4>when did you one realize this was it like you want to do it?</v>

2047
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:03.930
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

2048
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 4>That's what I did learn.</v>

2049
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 4>I did learn the twister that which is actually the rest of the wrestlers</v>

2050
00:57:07.781 --> 00:57:08.614
<v Speaker 4>guillotine.</v>

2051
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh you weren't laughing about my shitty wrestling.</v>

2052
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:10.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2053
00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 4>I was one take down in two years.</v>

2054
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:14.783
<v Speaker 4>It was after that,</v>

2055
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't get shit out of take downs or anything.</v>

2056
00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:21.310
<v Speaker 4>I was actually pretty good at arm drags but you know they say it's like a bike.</v>

2057
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I think after like 30 years,</v>

2058
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a bike no more.</v>

2059
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 4>You've got to start all over.</v>

2060
00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 4>Your body completely forgot it and you are a fucking white belt because I suck</v>

2061
00:57:28.421 --> 00:57:29.700
<v Speaker 4>at arm drags but I,</v>

2062
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 4>I in high school that was my shit.</v>

2063
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:35.330
<v Speaker 4>But what was also my shit was I was a leg rider cause it was weak and I at crave</v>

2064
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.540
<v Speaker 4>while everybody was supposed to be lifting weights,</v>

2065
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:39.780
<v Speaker 4>I was on the side of the fucking the building just like,</v>

2066
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.373
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

2071
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I never once threw legs in.</v>

2072
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why people are so good.</v>

2073
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:53.150
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2074
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.981
<v Speaker 4>most people don't.</v>

2075
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:57.270
<v Speaker 4>There's only like three per class and I was one of those guys.</v>

2076
00:57:57.271 --> 00:57:57.941
<v Speaker 4>It was the week guys.</v>

2077
00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.410

<v Speaker 4>Nico,</v>

2079
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.350

<v Speaker 4>I forget his last as first name something Nicco Chia.</v>

2082
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:12.890

2084
00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:17.501
<v Speaker 4>I got a question.</v>

2085
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tony?</v>

2088
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Alex Nicco Chia.</v>

2089
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.310
<v Speaker 4>That guy is the guy who taught shut up to Algebra.</v>

2090
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2091
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.760
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm trying to do.</v>

2092
00:58:25.761 --> 00:58:26.770
<v Speaker 4>A shout out to Alex.</v>

2093
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.633
<v Speaker 4>Alex,</v>

2094
00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 4>you showed it to me.</v>

2095
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Alex Nica Chair should be a fucking tee shirt,</v>

2096
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:31.721
<v Speaker 4>but he's still alive.</v>

2097
00:58:31.721 --> 00:58:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2098
00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 4>He's still your positive.</v>

2099
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:34.864
<v Speaker 4>Juliana.</v>

2100
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:36.990
<v Speaker 4>46 [inaudible] 80</v>

2101
00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 4>the guy was in 11th grade and I was in ninth Oh,</v>

2102
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

2103
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was the coach Jesse Barrios.</v>

2104
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:45.500
<v Speaker 4>He was the only other leg Raj Shadow.</v>

2105
00:58:45.501 --> 00:58:46.960
<v Speaker 4>So that was a twist to that.</v>

2106
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:50.170
<v Speaker 4>I learned the twister in high school and then when I went to Jiu Jitsu,</v>

2107
00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:50.441
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2108
00:58:50.441 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2109
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:53.530
<v Speaker 4>I already got it and a one move.</v>

2110
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 4>So I might take down suck,</v>

2111
00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.560
<v Speaker 4>but I got one move,</v>

2112
00:58:56.561 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 4>which I couldn't fucking do it on Jujitsu players because in wrestling you could</v>

2113
00:59:01.391 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 4>do it because you give up backs.</v>

2114
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 4>You know when you give up a back,</v>

2115
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:05.650
<v Speaker 4>you stick a leg hook in.</v>

2116
00:59:05.651 --> 00:59:06.221
<v Speaker 4>It's really easy.</v>

2117
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:07.054
<v Speaker 4>But in Jujitsu,</v>

2118
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.670
<v Speaker 4>giving the back is the ultimate sin.</v>

2119
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.421
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

2120
00:59:10.421 --> 00:59:10.631
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

2121
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:10.751
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2122
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:12.280
<v Speaker 4>No one's even giving me their fucking back.</v>

2123
00:59:12.281 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 4>How am I going to do this?</v>

2124
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.661
<v Speaker 4>Only the,</v>

2125
00:59:14.661 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 4>the only move I know in grappling and then so slowly I had to figure out how to</v>

2126
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>get to the wrestlers guillotine,</v>

2127
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 1>which later became the twister because Hagen and John jock named it.</v>

2128
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.340
<v Speaker 1>That shit I didn't</v>

2129
00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Speaker 1>out truck was your original teacher,</v>

2130
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:31.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2131
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2132
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2133
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 1>What a great guy.</v>

2134
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.451
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>

2135
00:59:33.451 --> 00:59:33.680
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

2136
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 1>is this a promotion for these two fighting?</v>

2137
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:36.021
<v Speaker 1>What's going on right now?</v>

2138
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't hear shit.</v>

2139
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's a two below gets the title now because he wanted the interim</v>

2140
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:46.961
<v Speaker 1>title with Frankie and now they're showing pedis highlights the showtime kick</v>

2141
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.371
<v Speaker 1>and it's a little weird.</v>

2142
00:59:49.371 --> 00:59:50.091
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting for a title.</v>

2143
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:50.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2144
00:59:50.341 --> 00:59:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's lost two of those last three.</v>

2145
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2146
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:53.750
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2147
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 1>what happened in his last fight?</v>

2148
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:55.700
<v Speaker 1>He Won.</v>

2149
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 1>He beat who did he beat?</v>

2150
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Olivera right.</v>

2151
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2152
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.373
<v Speaker 1>He submitted him.</v>

2153
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2154
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And before that he lost.</v>

2155
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.411
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2156
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>he's still Anthony motherfucking pedis dude.</v>

2157
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.531
<v Speaker 1>He was still,</v>

2158
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I love the summer.</v>

2159
01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna win some doesn't mean like,</v>

2160
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:10.551
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2161
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 1>it's over for him.</v>

2162
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

2163
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:12.343
<v Speaker 1>he just got fired.</v>

2164
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.181
<v Speaker 1>No one saying it's over.</v>

2165
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's a little strange that he's getting a title shot.</v>

2166
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2167
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>My question to life now at four 45 is fucking Stan.</v>

2168
01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Pettis was the 55 champ.</v>

2169
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>It was cancer two years ago.</v>

2170
01:00:27.471 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>

2171
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:28.791

2172
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:29.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2173
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be right there in the mix.</v>

2174
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.521
<v Speaker 1>That's my momma,</v>

2175
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:31.701
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>That's Anthony fucking pen for 45 it's always one nightmare.</v>

2177
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.671
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2178
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>well Max all we won nine in a row and he's just getting a title shot and is true</v>

2179
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>fan the UFC just,</v>

2182
01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of my favorite people in the UFC.</v>

2183
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of what's going on with,</v>

2184
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of,</v>

2185
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>of the direction that UFC is going for some reason should be</v>

2186
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>

2187
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It used to be that it was Dana,</v>

2188
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.751

<v Speaker 1>They know how to handle things,</v>

2224
01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.190

2226
01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>that mixed martial arts,</v>

2227
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2228
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>athletes association is the first time where it's like a serious issue for them</v>

2229
01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>to address.</v>

2230
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:05.061
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

2231
01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>how many different unions are there?</v>

2232
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>I heard there's more than,</v>

2233
01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about.</v>

2234
01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.611
<v Speaker 1>I tell you this or that,</v>

2235
01:02:10.611 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that it's a mixed martial arts athlete's Association,</v>

2236
01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>which I'm part of.</v>

2237
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy is,</v>

2238
01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>was there.</v>

2239
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>So there's four board members,</v>

2240
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2241
01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:20.041
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2242
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And they just announced it.</v>

2243
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They have over 200 fighters right now on board with it.</v>

2244
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>So first like legit movement of it.</v>

2245
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that entail?</v>

2246
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're on board.</v>

2247
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>So that means like if you go to fight for uh,</v>

2248
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:36.321
<v Speaker 1>you know you have a,</v>

2249
01:02:36.321 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>a UFC fight coming up.</v>

2250
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that or a bell tore,</v>

2251
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:39.721
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2252
01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:40.411
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's for everything,</v>

2253
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2254
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>It's for everything.</v>

2255
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just for,</v>

2256
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>it's for any organization that's mainly made up.</v>

2257
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Especially right now,</v>

2258
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>major UFC player.</v>

2259
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>She was a good question.</v>

2260
01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Does that hold true for like rises and stuff like that?</v>

2261
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Like what about um,</v>

2262
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>if you fight overseas,</v>

2263
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

2264
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is,</v>

2265
01:02:56.061 --> 01:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2266
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>their focus is UFC cause the top dog,</v>

2267
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 1>so if you start at the top is going to trickle down.</v>

2268
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that they're going to have a like a set a set amount of money or</v>

2269
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:07.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make per fight,</v>

2270
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2271
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:09.693
<v Speaker 1>Basic basically.</v>

2272
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.690
<v Speaker 1>And they're modeling after it after the base,</v>

2273
01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:13.201
<v Speaker 1>while union,</v>

2274
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 1>which is like the best in the world as far as compensation and equal rights.</v>

2275
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Good stuff.</v>

2276
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.420
<v Speaker 1>This is good stuff.</v>

2277
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Great stuff.</v>

2278
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2279
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2280
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Is there an essential,</v>

2281
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 1>is there any potential?</v>

2282
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:23.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2303
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2304
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>when they say this,</v>

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 1>How boy at one 70 is a video game character.</v>

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a video game.</v>

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Character works people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm training.</v>

2532
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.011
<v Speaker 1>He smirks.</v>

2533
01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>He's doing something different now because he's not fucking his body up to make</v>

2534
01:09:37.311 --> 01:09:40.070
<v Speaker 1>one 55 we're seeing 100% cowboy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got so much.</v>

2536
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't give a fucking him that to take a guy like that and like extract all the</v>

2537
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>water out of his body and drained them and deplete him.</v>

2538
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 1>You deplete some of that spirit that makes him exceptional.</v>

2539
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:51.890
<v Speaker 1>When that guy is healthy,</v>

2540
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:55.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like a lot of what I call it carries into the octagon with him.</v>

2541
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like this zest for life and it comes out when he's fighting.</v>

2542
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>You know like that gets depleted when you bodies look at common fact.</v>

2543

<v Speaker 1>He's got some tech path.</v>

2582
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:17.323
<v Speaker 1>Nema.</v>

2583
01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a bitch ass shit.</v>

2584
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Why can't do that after you do the other thing?</v>

2585
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Definitely kid,</v>

2586
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get lit up.</v>

2587
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Powerful Rico.</v>

2588
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Michael Clarke,</v>

2589
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:28.584
<v Speaker 1>Duncan.</v>

2590
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

2591
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 1>he does look like a good uppercut.</v>

2592
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2593
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>he's not fucking around.</v>

2594
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>He's already hurt throat slash and not fucking come out of booming.</v>

2595
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2596
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>what if he gets knocked out though?</v>

2597
01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.460
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] then he will never do this ever again.</v>

2598
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 1>He made us play mean.</v>

2599
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:45.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychological good move,</v>

2600
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:46.101
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2601
01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of negated by the fist bump.</v>

2602
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>The fist bump brings a confidence level back up.</v>

2603
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.173
<v Speaker 1>A solid shirt.</v>

2604
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2605
01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:53.850
<v Speaker 1>cannoneer is got to get over it.</v>

2606
01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:54.451
<v Speaker 1>The God factor,</v>

2607
01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 1>the guy's face looks so intimidating and once he does,</v>

2608
01:11:56.431 --> 01:11:57.264
<v Speaker 1>he's going to win.</v>

2609
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2610
01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.441
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

2611
01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's looking at his face anymore.</v>

2612
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Now they touch gloves again.</v>

2613
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of unity going on the ship and,</v>

2614
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to touch with the right hand that's going to favor cannoneer</v>

2615
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 1>keeps his hands down.</v>

2616
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:10.141
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

2617
01:12:10.141 --> 01:12:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

2618
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:11.341
<v Speaker 1>it's about fundamentals.</v>

2619
01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:11.881
<v Speaker 1>I've always told you,</v>

2620
01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

2621
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it's about fundamentals.</v>

2622
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I believe I've heard that from you.</v>

2623
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.610
<v Speaker 1>That's something you really do.</v>

2624
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:18.600
<v Speaker 1>This guy's an animal.</v>

2625
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I do recreational boxing and I'm a blue belt in Jujitsu.</v>

2626
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.180
<v Speaker 1>You know my problems.</v>

2627
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:27.930
<v Speaker 1>My problem lately with the MMA is that I've been watching too much.</v>

2628
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Moitai oh,</v>

2629
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>

2630
01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching a ton of Moitai lately.</v>

2631
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.210
<v Speaker 1>You're a stickler for technique.</v>

2632
01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:33.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2633
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2634
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I just recognize there's another level to be achieved that you're,</v>

2635
01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing like,</v>

2636
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 1>especially with striking with a lot of guys,</v>

2637
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing like a certain level of technique well on a consistent basis</v>

2638
01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:47.880
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

2639
01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.590
<v Speaker 1>they have to concentrate a lot of different things.</v>

2640
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2641
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:50.191
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2642
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:51.024
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

2643
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.070
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard when you have a few guys that have achieved like,</v>

2644
01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 1>like this Rory Macdonald's sort of spectrum and they can kind of do everything</v>

2645
01:12:59.521 --> 01:13:01.590
<v Speaker 1>really good at a very high level.</v>

2646
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you remember when Roy McDonald fought JT tourism metamorris yeah.</v>

2647
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Tinchy towards very high level Jujitsu guy.</v>

2648
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.131
<v Speaker 1>Roy Hung out with them,</v>

2649
01:13:08.131 --> 01:13:09.060
<v Speaker 1>almost got Kimora,</v>

2650
01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't tap holes.</v>

2651
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.801
<v Speaker 1>Got his arm broke.</v>

2652
01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately went to a draw,</v>

2654
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.621
<v Speaker 1>like fight.</v>

2655
01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2656
01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2657
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.113
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

2658
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:17.430
<v Speaker 1>The guy that the really high level French striker,</v>

2659
01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2660
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2661
01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>tarkes avatars half.</v>

2662
01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2663
01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 1>And he came up with a whole different style.</v>

2664
01:13:21.451 --> 01:13:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I was watching shows like Joe is it about the evolution of the sport?</v>

2665
01:13:25.681 --> 01:13:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Like Roy started MMA when he was 12 MMA.</v>

2666
01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.780
<v Speaker 1>He didn't specialize in anything.</v>

2667
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to see like,</v>

2668
01:13:31.951 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you look at fucking homeboy,</v>

2669
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2670
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 1>what's his name with the spiky here,</v>

2671
01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a more</v>

2672
01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Northcutt.</v>

2673
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.020
<v Speaker 1>He's also a kid who started,</v>

2674
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.210
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to get this wave of guys who just do wellness.</v>

2675
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Sage started with karate and he's way more of a karate guy that needs a Jujitsu</v>

2676
01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:49.651
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2677
01:13:49.651 --> 01:13:52.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he's not better at Jujitsu now.</v>

2678
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean he definitely showed that in his last fight and he submitted guys in the</v>

2679
01:13:55.891 --> 01:13:56.341
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

2680
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:56.521
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2681
01:13:56.521 --> 01:13:57.810
<v Speaker 1>he's just a young kid.</v>

2682
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2683
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.963
<v Speaker 1>Fruits,</v>

2684
01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.230
<v Speaker 1>genetically fantastic athlete.</v>

2685
01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Who's a young kid who's got a lot of life to learn guard against Micky Gall.</v>

2686
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:08.290
<v Speaker 1>When the fuck is you saying rip that Apple and that's a barn burner.</v>

2687
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.143
<v Speaker 1>When is that?</v>

2688
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:10.180
<v Speaker 1>When is that?</v>

2689
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.013
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2690
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.261
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2691
01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:12.480
<v Speaker 1>That fight is somewhere else.</v>

2692
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong?</v>

2693
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that fights.</v>

2694
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Sage Northcutt is a fun fight.</v>

2695
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that fight is somewhere else.</v>

2696
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Mickey calls him fucking get C's in my car is a motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>

2698
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I think he's more talented than sage Northcutt.</v>

2699
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:26.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:19:11.991 --> 01:19:12.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm all that.</v>

2868
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.020
<v Speaker 5>That's your boy hockey about,</v>

2869
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.111
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2870
01:19:15.111 --> 01:19:18.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it's hush hush upon all that.</v>

2871
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:22.890
<v Speaker 5>Amen.</v>

2872
01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:23.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2873
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:23.481
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

2874
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:24.140
<v Speaker 5>people have fun.</v>

2875
01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:24.741
<v Speaker 5>Let's protect it.</v>

2876
01:19:24.741 --> 01:19:25.390
<v Speaker 5>Oscar.</v>

2877
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 5>I hate,</v>

2878
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:27.740
<v Speaker 5>I love Oscar.</v>

2879
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.790
<v Speaker 5>He got punched him sprawl hard.</v>

2880
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:39.791
<v Speaker 5>Elbows on top shouldn't get just a good fire.</v>

2881
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:44.570
<v Speaker 5>What's really cool about MMA is that you can't really be the very best at</v>

2882
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

2883
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:48.650
<v Speaker 5>You could be the best to put it all together for your specific body.</v>

2884
01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 5>You bring the best at handling pressure in your division,</v>

2885
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:53.780
<v Speaker 5>but you can't be the best Jujitsu guy.</v>

2886
01:19:53.781 --> 01:19:55.940
<v Speaker 5>The best kickbox are the best wrestler.</v>

2887
01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.693
<v Speaker 5>You don't have time.</v>

2888
01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.510
<v Speaker 5>So many super athletes out there that it's almost impossible for one person to</v>

2889
01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:03.770
<v Speaker 5>be the very best at everything.</v>

2890
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:07.950
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the things that makes MMA so exciting is because you see this</v>

2891
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 3>collision of different strategies and you'll see one strategy work for a long</v>

2892
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:13.501
<v Speaker 3>time and you go,</v>

2893
01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:13.681
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2894
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:15.150
<v Speaker 3>ground and pound is where it's at.</v>

2895
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I remember when Vitor Belfort got up to 240 pounds because that was the mother</v>

2896
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:24.030
<v Speaker 3>fucking Mark Coleman era who turns wine on was for a little while while he was,</v>

2897
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:25.111
<v Speaker 3>but see,</v>

2898
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:25.771
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>

2899
01:20:25.771 --> 01:20:30.771
<v Speaker 3>That's what you get was just tackling dudes and smashing their fucking faces and</v>

2900
01:20:31.441 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 3>everybody panicked.</v>

2901
01:20:32.491 --> 01:20:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when you interviewed?</v>

2902
01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:34.344
<v Speaker 3>He was</v>

2903
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.860
<v Speaker 3>interviewed him one time and this was like literally 1516 years ago,</v>

2904
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:42.310
<v Speaker 3>joined and Marco's Joba.</v>

2905
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.080
<v Speaker 3>So what's your strategy and Mark Marcus,</v>

2906
01:20:44.081 --> 01:20:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of him.</v>

2907
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.541
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2908
01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:45.681
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2909
01:20:45.681 --> 01:20:45.871
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2910
01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:46.111
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2911
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:46.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2912
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:46.471
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2913
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:46.780
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2914
01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.010
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2915
01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:47.850
<v Speaker 3>he was drunk,</v>

2916
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.860
<v Speaker 3>but first of all that's scared.</v>

2917
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen you get scared,</v>

2918
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 3>but I love mark and mark and I had been friends for a long time.</v>

2919
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 3>So even though I was scared,</v>

2920
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I was reasonably sure he wasn't going to hurt me.</v>

2921
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.610
<v Speaker 3>But he picked me up like a pillow.</v>

2922
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I was a pillow and he spun me around the hair long ago.</v>

2923
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.003
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a day,</v>

2924
01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.260
<v Speaker 3>maybe a day.</v>

2925
01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:08.610
<v Speaker 3>A day.</v>

2926
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2927
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.200
<v Speaker 3>he's so strong.</v>

2928
01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I remember you said to me,</v>

2929
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:12.601
<v Speaker 3>you were stammering.</v>

2930
01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:12.960
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

2931
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.411
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2932
01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking scared.</v>

2933
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.073
<v Speaker 3>He's so strong.</v>

2934
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:16.730
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2935
01:21:16.730 --> 01:21:18.060
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I've never felt lighter.</v>

2936
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:19.143
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2937
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pick them up,</v>

2938
01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 3>throw them around and beat the fucking shit.</v>

2939
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:23.751
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

2940
01:21:23.751 --> 01:21:24.050
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2941
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.883
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2942
01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:25.680
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

2943
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.461
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking him down.</v>

2944
01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:28.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ground down the fucking shit out of him.</v>

2945
01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:29.111
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2946
01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:29.944
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

2947
01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:32.470
<v Speaker 3>I was asking him about him coming and you stammered.</v>

2948
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 3>I to forget,</v>

2949
01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget when I met him the first time I met him,</v>

2950
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.660
<v Speaker 3>it was after he got beat by Maurice Maurice Smith.</v>

2951
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:43.770
<v Speaker 3>And if you were a member,</v>

2952
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:46.100
<v Speaker 3>he was supposed to crush Maurice Smith.</v>

2953
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxers coming very well.</v>

2954
01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:52.020
<v Speaker 3>And at that point striking was useless at that point,</v>

2955
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:53.250
<v Speaker 3>striking was useless.</v>

2956
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And Mark Coleman emerge after hoists.</v>

2957
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:57.750
<v Speaker 3>So here comes Maury Smith,</v>

2958
01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:58.291
<v Speaker 3>the striker,</v>

2959
01:21:58.291 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 3>he don't know any digits.</v>

2960
01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't know Russell,</v>

2961
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:00.990
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get fucked up.</v>

2962
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:02.760
<v Speaker 3>But he beat him on cardio.</v>

2963
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:03.281
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2964
01:22:03.281 --> 01:22:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Cause remember Mark Homey like taking them down leg kicks.</v>

2965
01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 3>He got also give credit to frank shamrock cause frank shamrock worked a lot with</v>

2966
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Maury Smith before that fight.</v>

2967
01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they developed as a really good butterfly guard for</v>

2968
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Maurice.</v>

2969
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Maurice kept elevating marks.</v>

2970
01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Hips kept moving around a lot,</v>

2971
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 3>a very hard guard to pass.</v>

2972
01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:24.770
<v Speaker 3>Very Good Smith,</v>

2973
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.151
<v Speaker 3>Maurice Smith.</v>

2974
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 3>What Maurice Smith had been most guys didn't happen in the early days is you</v>

2975
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:32.130
<v Speaker 3>couldn't pass his guard.</v>

2976
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.940
<v Speaker 3>He had a very good butterfly garden.</v>

2977
01:22:34.941 --> 01:22:38.430
<v Speaker 3>He know how to retail and use Lothrop done shit back in the day.</v>

2978
01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2979
01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.850
<v Speaker 3>so uh,</v>

2980
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Marc Coleman kept taking him down at will but he couldn't finish him off.</v>

2981
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:44.700
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have any.</v>

2982
01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Here's another point.</v>

2983
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.800
<v Speaker 3>He was in his late guy.</v>

2984
01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.580
<v Speaker 3>His Fun.</v>

2985
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.413
<v Speaker 3>I love Maurice.</v>

2986
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Cause another important,</v>

2987
01:22:49.621 --> 01:22:51.840
<v Speaker 3>very important point if you are,</v>

2988
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:56.030
<v Speaker 3>if you are a an outstanding world class kickboxer like his,</v>

2989
01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.240
<v Speaker 3>he is the same principles of defense apply on the ground with ground and pound.</v>

2990
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:01.980
<v Speaker 3>It's harder to move your head backwards,</v>

2991
01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:02.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2992
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:07.340
<v Speaker 3>But a guy like that is significantly harder to hit than a guy who's not used to</v>

2993
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>taking punches.</v>

2994
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:08.711
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2995
01:23:08.711 --> 01:23:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Front of someone just turned on many and freezes up.</v>

2996
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 3>So when he sees these big bombs come coming,</v>

2997
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 3>he's doing a lot of this.</v>

2998
01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2999
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 3>he's grabbing you.</v>

3000
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.073
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

3001
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to sit there.</v>

3002
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 3>And of course there are guys that are overwhelming.</v>

3003
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:22.390
<v Speaker 3>There's guys like,</v>

3004
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 3>like I keep bringing up cro cop versus Gonzaga cause the second fight with cro</v>

3005
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 3>cop got revenge when he got on top of Gonzaga.</v>

3006
01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:28.871
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3007
01:23:28.871 --> 01:23:31.900
<v Speaker 3>when you see a world class striker,</v>

01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker with that shit.</v>

3291
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I never seen anybody from the guard setting up risks,</v>

3292
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking biceps smashers and flipping,</v>

3293
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:42.630
<v Speaker 1>enrolling people in 30 seconds.</v>

3294
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Fuck three,</v>

3295
01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 1>not 38 seconds.</v>

3296
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:46.360
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>

3297
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.730
<v Speaker 1>People were giving a standing ovation look pretty good.</v>

3298
01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:49.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3299
01:32:49.241 --> 01:32:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Well it's always interesting.</v>

3300
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Next two fights or big gives the fucking Kaboom is getting much better.</v>

3301
01:32:54.911 --> 01:32:55.561
<v Speaker 1>Good boxer.</v>

3302
01:32:55.561 --> 01:32:56.740
<v Speaker 1>This said next slice.</v>

3303
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3304
01:32:57.221 --> 01:33:00.730
<v Speaker 1>we definitely was way more calm on his feet when he stood in front of them and</v>

3305
01:33:00.731 --> 01:33:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

3306
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 1>well you also realize this dude was kind of gassed out.</v>

3307
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 1>You get a little emotional with the fight.</v>

3308
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:08.530
<v Speaker 1>You know you're either a killer or you want everybody to think you're a killer</v>

3309
01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:12.850
<v Speaker 1>or killers or like fade or never did any of that stupid shit.</v>

3310
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:13.953
<v Speaker 1>Quiet.</v>

3311
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Can't leave Cain.</v>

3312
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Cain Velasquez is my all time favorite way in face cause like he doesn't give a</v>

3313
01:33:21.611 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 1>fuck thing.</v>

3314
01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:23.310
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3315
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

3316
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I to be a little nervous.</v>

3317
01:33:26.171 --> 01:33:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a PA tank of gas and I'm going to rain bombs down on you until</v>

3318
01:33:30.581 --> 01:33:31.300
<v Speaker 1>it's all over.</v>

3319
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.133
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

3320
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:33.490
<v Speaker 1>When does he fight next?</v>

3321
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:37.030
<v Speaker 1>December 30th he's fighting December 30th but man,</v>

3322
01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.260
<v Speaker 1>there was just some surgery.</v>

3323
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.640
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is he need surgery.</v>

3324
01:33:39.650 --> 01:33:40.180
<v Speaker 1>You say?</v>

3325
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear that.</v>

3326
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:42.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like his 12th surgery since he's been in.</v>

3327
01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:46.660
<v Speaker 1>But you can't say you got a fight coming up and then afterwards you're going to</v>

3328
01:33:46.661 --> 01:33:47.371
<v Speaker 1>get surgery.</v>

3329
01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:49.990
<v Speaker 1>No sound because that's a ridiculous thing to say.</v>

3330
01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the life they live,</v>

3331
01:33:51.101 --> 01:33:51.430
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

3332
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:52.091
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3333
01:33:52.091 --> 01:33:54.670
<v Speaker 1>But to say it publicly seems pretty ridiculous.</v>

3334
01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Efficient insurance involved.</v>

3335
01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point from a business move,</v>

3336
01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:00.730
<v Speaker 1>but as a fan you got to appreciate the honesty.</v>

3337
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:01.111
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3338
01:34:01.111 --> 01:34:01.601
<v Speaker 1>it's true too.</v>

3339
01:34:01.601 --> 01:34:01.991
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

3340
01:34:01.991 --> 01:34:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I should have surgery,</v>

3341
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.950
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to beat this motherfucker so bad and get to the title shot.</v>

3342
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wait and do it after.</v>

3343
01:34:07.151 --> 01:34:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good question.</v>

3344
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you say he does look very helpful?</v>

3345
01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It looks very clean.</v>

3346
01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

3347
01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that insurance should cover all of the injuries sustained during</v>

3348
01:34:18.881 --> 01:34:19.361
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

3349
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 1>which of course all of them are.</v>

3350
01:34:20.890 --> 01:34:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3351
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 1>100% right.</v>

3352
01:34:22.721 --> 01:34:23.554
<v Speaker 1>I agree with.</v>

3353
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that the case right now?</v>

3354
01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Like what does insurance cover now?</v>

3355
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Does it only cover things that happened in a fight?</v>

3356
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3357
01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 1>it covers,</v>

3358
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3359
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive you got asked when your UFC boys,</v>

3360
01:34:34.481 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure it covers when you're in training camp for that fight.</v>

3361
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3362
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:38.801
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3363
01:34:38.801 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Like certain amount of weeks outside of training camp as you're preparing for</v>

3364
01:34:41.891 --> 01:34:42.580
<v Speaker 1>the bout.</v>

3365
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:44.260
<v Speaker 1>But if let's say I have nothing scheduled,</v>

3366
01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:44.771
<v Speaker 1>I get hurt.</v>

3367
01:34:44.771 --> 01:34:45.431
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cover that.</v>

3368
01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's the case then it doesn't,</v>

3369
01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:49.180
<v Speaker 1>then what he said was actually kind of gangster.</v>

3370
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:50.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3371
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Super gangs.</v>

3372
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's already covered by insurance and he's going to come in and say,</v>

3373
01:34:54.101 --> 01:34:54.311
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3374
01:34:54.311 --> 01:34:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm kind of injured here,</v>

3375
01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but I'll deal with it and your ass.</v>

3376
01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3377
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 1>How great is that?</v>

3378
01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.370
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

3379
01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:02.000
<v Speaker 1>All Mike Brown warming up must get the early.</v>

3380
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar had a fucking pretty significant knee injury leading up to the</v>

3381
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 1>fight with Jeremy Stephens.</v>

3382
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Well how about for doom?</v>

3383
01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:11.080
<v Speaker 1>They said he went into the fight against trash with a broken foot.</v>

3384
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Me Lie jumping side kicked him in.</v>

3385
01:35:13.011 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>The face landed that shit dumb.</v>

3386
01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:18.110
<v Speaker 1>They tricks and wobbled first food for the fight,</v>

3387
01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:18.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3388
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.690
<v Speaker 1>So gangster man.</v>

3389
01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3390
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:21.223
<v Speaker 1>fighting hard enough,</v>

3391
01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 1>let alone with broken.</v>

3392
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.080
<v Speaker 1>That was just what they'll,</v>

3393
01:35:24.081 --> 01:35:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Travis Browne to crazy things happen to him in that fight.</v>

3394
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:28.940
<v Speaker 1>There's that kick that he opens up with like,</v>

3395
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:30.470
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck is this coming from?</v>

3396
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.573
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3397
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:32.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3398
01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.660
<v Speaker 1>when Verdomme threw that punch and hit his finger is,</v>

3399
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:38.503
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

01:35:41.451 --> 01:35:41.631
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3404
01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:42.740

01:35:47.121 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 1>You want to kick you right in the face.</v>

3412
01:35:48.850 --> 01:35:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3415
01:35:50.931 --> 01:35:51.681
<v Speaker 1>Because if he says,</v>

3416
01:35:51.681 --> 01:35:52.221
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

3417

<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

3418
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.811
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

3419
01:35:53.811 --> 01:35:54.680
<v Speaker 1>My finger's broken.</v>

3420
01:35:54.681 --> 01:35:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Then they stopped a fight,</v>

3421
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.680
<v Speaker 1>then you're correct and not attack him.</v>

3422
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.040
<v Speaker 1>But I went just get a second limit my finger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3424
01:36:01.461 --> 01:36:02.360

3425
01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:07.361
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want that fight to end right there to Ju [inaudible] I went to stay</v>

3426
01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

3427
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to leave room for an emotional mistake in a time of duress like that</v>

3428
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.150
<v Speaker 1>where someone might have fun?</v>

3432
01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:18.590
<v Speaker 1>He's okay.</v>

3433
01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3434
01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3435
01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:19.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3436
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:19.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3437
01:36:19.731 --> 01:36:19.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3438
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And then jumps back in like there's moments where something could go wrong.</v>

3439
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't even realize like this there a malfunction of my glove.</v>

3440
01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3441
01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Why's my finger bed sideways?</v>

3442
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:28.791
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3443
01:36:28.791 --> 01:36:29.091
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3444
01:36:29.091 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's going on?</v>

3445
01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3446
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:32.000
<v Speaker 1>there is moments but,</v>

3447
01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:32.834
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3448
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you know you'd take it back to game of fucking Thrones.</v>

3449
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 1>They would let him draw the line.</v>

3450
01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:39.531
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what.</v>

3451
01:36:39.531 --> 01:36:40.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to come around.</v>

3452
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:44.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like an iPad.</v>

3453
01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:48.250
<v Speaker 1>No Shit on both these.</v>

3454
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:54.000
<v Speaker 1>The reason why that doesn't count is because it didn't happen from him going for</v>

3455
01:36:54.001 --> 01:36:59.001
<v Speaker 1>a on this sketch it happened because for June threw a punch at La aimed at his</v>

3456
01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:00.590
<v Speaker 1>hand and that broke his finger</v>

3457
01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 1>in your nose right now,</v>

3458
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Travis Travis,</v>

3459
01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Travis had his hands up and for doom through one of them.</v>

3460
01:37:06.861 --> 01:37:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Crazy Chuck Odell style or brand,</v>

3461
01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.760
<v Speaker 1>but it was a pie ended on the fingers.</v>

3462
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:11.623
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3463
01:37:12.210 --> 01:37:14.180
<v Speaker 1>That broke his finger broke</v>

3464
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:17.320
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3465
01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3466
01:37:17.530 --> 01:37:17.961
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3467
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Function of that injury is,</v>

3468
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:22.280
<v Speaker 1>you could argue is poor technique,</v>

3469
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:22.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3470
01:37:22.731 --> 01:37:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Because that might hold technique that might work with MMA.</v>

3471
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Where with boxing gloves rather,</v>

3472
01:37:26.601 --> 01:37:27.434
<v Speaker 1>a more tech gloves,</v>

3473
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3474
01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:28.634
<v Speaker 1>to have your hands</v>

3475
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.280
<v Speaker 1>like this and to have a kid coming at you and held your hands and also helps</v>

3476
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.910
<v Speaker 1>them to braise.</v>

3477
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.140
<v Speaker 1>It gives us more space.</v>

3478
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:40.340
<v Speaker 1>If we could see it.</v>

3479
01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can see it,</v>

3480
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:43.430
<v Speaker 1>but break John Jones about having an open hand.</v>

3481
01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3482
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:43.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3483
01:37:43.881 --> 01:37:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

3484
01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 1>that's authentically though.</v>

3485
01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.493
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at,</v>

3486
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.300
<v Speaker 1>let's look at,</v>

3487
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:48.590
<v Speaker 1>let's look a good pot bottle.</v>

3488
01:37:48.591 --> 01:37:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

3489
01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point in time.</v>

3490
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:52.363
<v Speaker 1>Breaking a finger</v>

3491
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:54.440
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>

3492
01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 1>How often do practice punching fingers</v>

3493
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:56.701
<v Speaker 5>in the gym?</v>

3494
01:37:56.701 --> 01:37:57.780
<v Speaker 5>Once a week or twice a week.</v>

3495
01:37:57.810 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't practice snapping.</v>

3496
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:01.340
<v Speaker 5>Arms are knocking guys out.</v>

3497
01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.193
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

3498
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:03.580
<v Speaker 5>That's your frankness.</v>

3499
01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:04.291
<v Speaker 5>Our bars.</v>

3500
01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Let's look.</v>

3501
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 5>Practice armbars.</v>

3502
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.020
<v Speaker 5>How could you not break his arm bar?</v>

3503
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:07.210
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3504
01:38:07.210 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 5>Practice snapping natural art.</v>

3505
01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 5>No bars aren't snapping arms.</v>

3506
01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 5>Guys were looking at this fight right here.</v>

3507
01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:13.831
<v Speaker 5>This is a,</v>

3508
01:38:13.831 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 5>the punch where that landed,</v>

3509
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean authentic move by for doom,</v>

3510
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:19.350
<v Speaker 5>but I can't fault anything Travis did.</v>

3511
01:38:19.351 --> 01:38:22.430
<v Speaker 5>That was a freak accident because he's doing the right thing to Joe.</v>

3512
01:38:22.431 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mapping his hand up.</v>

3513
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

3514
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:25.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3515
01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:25.741
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3516
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 5>I agree with now if he did it and his finger at in his shorts and he's like,</v>

3517
01:38:28.501 --> 01:38:28.741
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

3518
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:29.551
<v Speaker 5>give him a second limb.</v>

3519
01:38:29.551 --> 01:38:30.540
<v Speaker 5>Figure out if he wants Canadian.</v>

3520
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:31.850
<v Speaker 5>Here's a question.</v>

3521
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 5>Offensive move.</v>

3522
01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:34.940
<v Speaker 5>The hundred percent is the fish fingers.</v>

3523
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:35.761
<v Speaker 5>His name is breaking the face,</v>

3524
01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:37.770
<v Speaker 5>breaking it or the more different than people in your arm,</v>

3525
01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:38.311
<v Speaker 5>your shoulder,</v>

3526
01:38:38.311 --> 01:38:38.790
<v Speaker 5>your neck.</v>

3527
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:40.770
<v Speaker 5>But we have some weird sort of distinction.</v>

3528
01:38:40.771 --> 01:38:40.981
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3529
01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 5>Which is why you can say time out for that,</v>

3530
01:38:43.021 --> 01:38:44.940
<v Speaker 5>but you can't say timeout if you get hit in the nose.</v>

3531
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3532
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:46.291
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

3533
01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:47.820
<v Speaker 5>if you're ever doing crew for there,</v>

3534
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.080
<v Speaker 5>no fucking timeouts.</v>

3535
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:50.040
<v Speaker 5>And when the afternoon was like,</v>

3536
01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.150
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous.</v>

3537
01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.013
<v Speaker 5>Why is that?</v>

3538
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 5>Brought that up to the post fight interview.</v>

3539
01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 5>I was really clear like you were well within your rights to go after him.</v>

3540
01:38:56.971 --> 01:38:57.331
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

3541
01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:02.331
<v Speaker 5>That was inside the rules for their audience and for let's just be cool about</v>

3542
01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:03.450
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3543
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:03.871
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3544
01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:04.950
<v Speaker 5>your finger got caught.</v>

3545
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't fucking want you to die,</v>

3546
01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:09.630
<v Speaker 5>but that's there's millions of dollars.</v>

3547
01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:10.920
<v Speaker 5>It's like come on,</v>

3548
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:11.761
<v Speaker 5>but hold on a second.</v>

3549
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Test Freddy's got a good point to the audience wants it to go on.</v>

3550
01:39:16.021 --> 01:39:18.510
<v Speaker 5>Like we were like we'd pay and it's not like Anderson,</v>

3551
01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:19.800
<v Speaker 5>so big deals and,</v>

3552
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:21.830
<v Speaker 5>and for that one guy only,</v>

3553
01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 5>it only makes sense for the guy that threw the punch.</v>

3554
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:26.500
<v Speaker 5>That's the only guy that didn't make sense inflicted</v>

3555
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:30.530
<v Speaker 5>but nobody,</v>

3556
01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.850
<v Speaker 5>nobody's trying to break fingers with punches.</v>

3557
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.170
<v Speaker 5>If that was part of the sport,</v>

3558
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.180
<v Speaker 5>you gotta practice prick fingers.</v>

3559
01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 5>It's not illegal.</v>

3560
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:39.990
<v Speaker 5>Let me knock out some walls here.</v>

3561
01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:40.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not illegal to</v>

3562
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:44.783
<v Speaker 5>give Joe Rogan.</v>

3563
01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Let me knock down some walls here.</v>

3564
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 5>You're both right.</v>

3565
01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:48.683
<v Speaker 5>You're both right.</v>

3566
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 5>You're both right.</v>

3567
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah is absolutely.</v>

3568
01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:51.181
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

3569
01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:52.020
<v Speaker 5>it's absolutely</v>

3570
01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:55.441
<v Speaker 5>and the Phi.</v>

3571
01:39:55.441 --> 01:40:00.441
<v Speaker 5>It's absolutely an injury caused by someone executing a technique.</v>

3572
01:40:00.601 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 5>But wouldn't you like to fight to keep going?</v>

3573
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:03.380
<v Speaker 5>Just tore.</v>

3574
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.710
<v Speaker 5>Would you like to say Matt,</v>

3575
01:40:04.711 --> 01:40:05.544
<v Speaker 5>would you like,</v>

3576
01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:10.500
<v Speaker 5>would you like Cain Velasquez or excuse me a for BC we're doing to win on</v>

3577
01:40:10.501 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 5>technical knockout due to a fingerprint break.</v>

3578
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:13.383
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't matter.</v>

3579
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

3580
01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:16.710
<v Speaker 5>I agree with the answer.</v>

3581
01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:17.311
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you,</v>

3582
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:19.500
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not saying guys within the rules.</v>

3583
01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying what do you want to see?</v>

3584
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.290
<v Speaker 5>Let me knock some walls down.</v>

3585
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:23.803
<v Speaker 5>Let me</v>

3586
01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.570
<v Speaker 5>wrap this shit up.</v>

3587
01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.540
<v Speaker 5>You got to stop talking over each eye and it's brutal.</v>

3588
01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:31.320
<v Speaker 5>But I'm Brown.</v>

3589
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm the wise one.</v>

3590
01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.120
<v Speaker 5>Let me wrap this up guys.</v>

3591
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3592
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:33.871
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>

3593
01:40:33.871 --> 01:40:34.704
<v Speaker 5>let me cork it up.</v>

3594
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Quote some from the Washington parents.</v>

3595
01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:37.391
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

3596
01:40:37.391 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3597
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:38.700
<v Speaker 5>it's fair to say.</v>

3598
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.940
<v Speaker 5>It's fair to say you'll know it when you see it.</v>

3599
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.570
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3600
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:42.931
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3601
01:40:42.931 --> 01:40:44.130
<v Speaker 5>And it's up to you.</v>

3602
01:40:44.131 --> 01:40:45.300
<v Speaker 5>There's distractions in life.</v>

3603
01:40:45.301 --> 01:40:46.170
<v Speaker 5>There's discretion.</v>

3604
01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:46.591
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3605
01:40:46.591 --> 01:40:48.900
<v Speaker 5>when you see it and leave it up to the fighters,</v>

3606
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.793
<v Speaker 5>leave it up to the ref.</v>

3607
01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:50.910
<v Speaker 5>You'll know it when you see it.</v>

3608
01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:52.410
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a case by case basis.</v>

3609
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Just one.</v>

3610
01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Just one Brendan in one.</v>

3611
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.270
<v Speaker 3>There's just choices.</v>

3612
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3613
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

3614
01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:04.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason every situation's different,</v>

3615
01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:04.871
<v Speaker 3>but they also,</v>

3616
01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:06.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what happened to your finger.</v>

3617
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just got cracked.</v>

3618
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:09.130
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know what happened.</v>

3619
01:41:09.131 --> 01:41:11.800
<v Speaker 3>He might thought he might've thought his finger cause it wasn't working right.</v>

3620
01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Was tied up in his glove.</v>

3621
01:41:13.121 --> 01:41:14.260
<v Speaker 3>What does it look at it?</v>

3622
01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:16.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Verdomme is wrong.</v>

3623
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:18.730
<v Speaker 3>I think for dooms 100% right.</v>

3624
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:21.520
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's a moment of confusion.</v>

3625
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not like Travis got head kicked and was confused cause you've got almost</v>

3626
01:41:24.821 --> 01:41:25.630
<v Speaker 3>knocked out.</v>

3627
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I think when his finger was fucked up,</v>

3628
01:41:27.671 --> 01:41:29.650
<v Speaker 3>he didn't necessarily know what was going on.</v>

3629
01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3630
01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I think we have split second.</v>

3631
01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not that's true.</v>

3632
01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:33.191
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3633
01:41:33.191 --> 01:41:33.761
<v Speaker 3>Only he knows,</v>

3634
01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:35.980
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying there's a total possibility.</v>

3635
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:37.940
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure you get your finger smashed.</v>

3636
01:41:38.690 --> 01:41:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Mediator Joe's,</v>

3637
01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:41.483
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3638
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:42.643
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3639
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:43.880
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>

3640
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:45.190
<v Speaker 3>I tried to look at the whole thing.</v>

3641
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.881
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

3642
01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying even if he was like,</v>

3643
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:47.621
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

3644
01:41:47.621 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 3>my fingers broke.</v>

3645
01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:49.421
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking like,</v>

3646
01:41:49.421 --> 01:41:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

3647
01:41:49.630 --> 01:41:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Is that bro?</v>

3648
01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:51.023
<v Speaker 3>You all right bro.</v>

3649
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.341
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

3650
01:41:51.341 --> 01:41:52.450
<v Speaker 3>let's keep going on the street.</v>

3651
01:41:52.451 --> 01:41:52.951
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>

3652
01:41:52.951 --> 01:41:56.980
<v Speaker 3>It broke your fucking finger when it comes to a head kick to finish it off</v>

3653
01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.410
<v Speaker 3>because we have millions of dollars on the line yet.</v>

3654
01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:00.583
<v Speaker 3>Not Angry.</v>

3655
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3656
01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.111
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3657
01:42:01.111 --> 01:42:01.231
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3658
01:42:01.231 --> 01:42:01.381
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3659
01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:01.511
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3660
01:42:01.511 --> 01:42:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3661
01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3662
01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 3>You're right to no,</v>

3663
01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:04.991
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3664
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 3>I agree this and here's a thing.</v>

3665
01:42:06.581 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Then I argue with the finger,</v>

3666
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.551
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3667
01:42:08.551 --> 01:42:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3668
01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:09.540
<v Speaker 3>here's your coach.</v>

3669
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.373
<v Speaker 3>I'm leading.</v>

3670
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm literally not even arguing with you because I see your point 100% but I also</v>

3671
01:42:14.411 --> 01:42:16.570
<v Speaker 3>saw you are to Brendan and I see even if,</v>

3672
01:42:16.571 --> 01:42:20.140
<v Speaker 3>but I also as a person who's greedy when I'm at home,</v>

3673
01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I want to see them keep fighting.</v>

3674
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you.</v>

3675
01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:26.890
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3676
01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm greedy.</v>

3677
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:27.941
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3678
01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of Fabrizio and I would like to see him win.</v>

3679
01:42:30.191 --> 01:42:30.790
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>

3680
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:34.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a feeling that I get from someone winning by a broken finger that I</v>

3681
01:42:34.301 --> 01:42:35.051
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>

3682
01:42:35.051 --> 01:42:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

3683
01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.270
<v Speaker 3>I liked the feeling furbish you'll want a clear decision because shit out of</v>

3684
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:41.143
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

3685
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I promise.</v>

3686
01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Brendan's are like,</v>

3687
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:50.231
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3688
01:42:50.231 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 3>he want his shit broken.</v>

3689
01:42:52.451 --> 01:42:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Finger broken.</v>

3690
01:42:56.490 --> 01:42:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Here's a better question.</v>

3691
01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Here's a better question cause it's an illegal move.</v>

3692
01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:04.810
<v Speaker 3>How much of an effect should I poke B because I really feel like,</v>

3693
01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I think not only does it change the game,</v>

3694
01:43:06.551 --> 01:43:08.190
<v Speaker 3>like mitre own versus Travis Browne.</v>

3695
01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Here's a case where the foul went and Travis has favor.</v>

3696
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:13.510
<v Speaker 3>When when he poked uh,</v>

3697
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Mitrione and stated the permission to by the grace and he did it twice.</v>

3698
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.130
<v Speaker 3>It was two IPOs.</v>

3699
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3700
01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And then you know Mitch reone who was winning the fight then goes to losing the</v>

3701
01:43:23.021 --> 01:43:23.310
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3702
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3703
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a significant factor.</v>

3704
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

3705
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Almost.</v>

3706
01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:30.280
<v Speaker 3>It's almost so significant that if you're marginally impaired from it,</v>

3707
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:32.380
<v Speaker 3>you might want to stop the fight.</v>

3708
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3709
01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:33.531
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel?</v>

3710
01:43:33.531 --> 01:43:35.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's just crazy because you're in the moment.</v>

3711
01:43:35.591 --> 01:43:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It's such a difficult like rational decision to make.</v>

3712
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:41.250
<v Speaker 3>But if you're fucked up and you could barely see out of one eye,</v>

3713
01:43:41.251 --> 01:43:41.501
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3714
01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:41.681
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3715
01:43:41.681 --> 01:43:42.281
<v Speaker 3>I want to keep going.</v>

3716
01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

3717
01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.810
<v Speaker 3>so you've been poked in the eye.</v>

3718
01:43:43.811 --> 01:43:48.811
<v Speaker 3>How terrible for that bitch recover those Tuesday and some guys never come back</v>

3719
01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 3>from that is well that was a kick.</v>

3720
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 5>I believe any,</v>

3721
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:58.901
<v Speaker 5>any eye injury could be like [inaudible] is a full third possibility that that</v>

3722
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:05.090
<v Speaker 5>could design some kind of like fighting goggle thing.</v>

3723
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:06.570
<v Speaker 5>Is that a possibility?</v>

3724
01:44:06.610 --> 01:44:08.470
<v Speaker 5>It would have to look up to protect the ice.</v>

3725
01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:10.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3726
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.900
<v Speaker 5>When you guys are getting poked,</v>

3727
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:15.170
<v Speaker 5>the only way you could do it is if you came up with some sort of adhesive,</v>

3728
01:44:15.171 --> 01:44:16.190
<v Speaker 5>like some crazy,</v>

3729
01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 5>crazy glue shit that you could stick this fucking thing to your face where it's</v>

3730
01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:24.170
<v Speaker 5>impossible to pull it off for all those are the only way.</v>

3731
01:44:24.171 --> 01:44:28.280
<v Speaker 5>But it would have to like literally almost be like cups that covered your eyes</v>

3732
01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:30.080
<v Speaker 5>but were like glued in your head.</v>

3733
01:44:30.081 --> 01:44:31.640
<v Speaker 5>And then afterwards they put some solvent on it,</v>

3734
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 5>but then we would find out five years later that fucking people are dying from</v>

3735
01:44:36.021 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 5>cancer brain.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's not going to in here.</v>

3862
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:43.363
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

3863
01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3865
01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:47.670
<v Speaker 1>not stopping it or been doing a great job.</v>

3866
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.810
<v Speaker 1>She made the ask move</v>

3867
01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:57.340
<v Speaker 1>to see the ass must be starving.</v>

3868
01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Such a monster that shows you how good herb dean is.</v>

3869
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:02.280
<v Speaker 1>That shows you right there how he knows his shit.</v>

3870
01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes ass look at this,</v>

3871
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but Mazda doll has got pinned up against the cage.</v>

3872
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Ellenberger has got to get some space.</v>

3873
01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3874
01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:08.670
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3875
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

3876
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Circle left circle.</v>

3877
01:48:09.881 --> 01:48:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Lap shake has done a boxing bag these up.</v>

3878
01:48:12.170 --> 01:48:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3879
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.260
<v Speaker 1>well Jake still possesses that crazy fast twitch muscle fiber.</v>

3880
01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:17.610
<v Speaker 1>So if he can connect,</v>

3881
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:18.444
<v Speaker 1>he can crack you.</v>

3882
01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:18.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3883
01:48:18.611 --> 01:48:19.441
<v Speaker 1>the last thing he goes,</v>

3884
01:48:19.441 --> 01:48:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Powell.</v>

3885
01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Jake's always had power,</v>

3886
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.770
<v Speaker 1>but when you get hurt,</v>

3887
01:48:22.771 --> 01:48:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you always start reaching for that cause you know you're not going to play like</v>

3888
01:48:25.741 --> 01:48:28.230
<v Speaker 1>a points game from here on out cause you're diminished.</v>

3889
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:31.710
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a few like significant rounds in your chamber.</v>

3890
01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of how long it's going to take.</v>

3891
01:48:33.661 --> 01:48:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Jake Ellenberger right now to recover.</v>

3892
01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:36.241
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

3893
01:48:36.241 --> 01:48:37.340
<v Speaker 1>if he's been trained with curse on,</v>

3894
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I think he has for this fight.</v>

3895
01:48:38.371 --> 01:48:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I know he asked for this fight.</v>

3896
01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:40.231
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

3897
01:48:40.231 --> 01:48:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it's been at kings to training with nick.</v>

3898
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Curse on is a big thing,</v>

3899
01:48:43.081 --> 01:48:43.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3900
01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Nickerson.</v>

3901
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Who was that?</v>

3902
01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.820
<v Speaker 1>MARV Marinovich disciple.</v>

3903
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a wizard man.</v>

3904
01:48:47.611 --> 01:48:51.210
<v Speaker 1>He knows off fuck load about strength and conditioning and getting guys ready</v>

3905
01:48:51.211 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 1>for fights both physically and mentally.</v>

3906
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think he helped Ellenberger a lot would giving them the confidence with</v>

3907
01:48:57.541 --> 01:49:00.480
<v Speaker 1>being in that insane shape to get ready for Matt Brown.</v>

3908
01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3909
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 1>there's no coach on the planet and go,</v>

3910
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:03.151
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3911
01:49:03.151 --> 01:49:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna get fucked up the first minute and then we can work on that.</v>

3912
01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:07.981
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3913
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3914
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no conditioning for that,</v>

3915
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3916
01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:10.860
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

3917
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.390
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you got to the x factor,</v>

3918
01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:16.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like Ellenberger is a real veteran now and he's experienced those</v>

3919
01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:17.810
<v Speaker 1>disappointing defeats.</v>

3920
01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.750
<v Speaker 1>He's been in those super highlight knockouts like the map route fight like</v>

3921
01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:22.850
<v Speaker 1>shields fight.</v>

3922
01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:27.850
<v Speaker 1>He's composed after taking a look at how compelling elements more legit and war</v>

3923
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:31.230
<v Speaker 1>and the best of all,</v>

3924
01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Hillary loves them.</v>

3925
01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Ellen Bird?</v>

3926
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3927
01:49:34.711 --> 01:49:35.081
<v Speaker 1>The fuck up.</v>

3928
01:49:35.081 --> 01:49:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke.</v>

3929
01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I know that Ellenberger knocked out palae Landy with one punch.</v>

3930
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3931
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.230
<v Speaker 1>That was back in the Disney Belfour.</v>

3932
01:49:42.610 --> 01:49:43.141
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

3933
01:49:43.141 --> 01:49:43.371
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

3934
01:49:43.371 --> 01:49:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was a belt.</v>

3935
01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:45.220
<v Speaker 1>We're fighting.</v>

3936
01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

3937
01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:46.591
<v Speaker 1>And he took it on.</v>

3938
01:49:46.591 --> 01:49:47.190
<v Speaker 1>She was you.</v>

3939
01:49:47.190 --> 01:49:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a good boxer.</v>

3940
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:55.380
<v Speaker 3>He was some Jake Ellenberger oh one with the wheelchair left kick to the body.</v>

3941
01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.693
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

3942
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh Ellen.</v>

3943
01:49:58.471 --> 01:50:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Berta slipped and broke his foot toe stuck in that cage.</v>

3944
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:04.840
<v Speaker 3>You should let him recover.</v>

3945
01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.393
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

3946
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.581
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3947
01:50:06.581 --> 01:50:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I think he broke his foot and ankle.</v>

3948
01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.120
<v Speaker 3>You can the cage.</v>

3949
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:12.130
<v Speaker 3>What do you do at this point?</v>

3950
01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.033
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3954
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:21.030

3955
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:22.330

3956
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Is this fight stopped?</v>

3957
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.420
<v Speaker 3>John Joe Joe's going to say,</v>

3961
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I'd haven't picked aside.</v>

3963
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.180

3970
01:50:51.641 --> 01:50:53.030

3990
01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.300

3991
01:51:28.450 --> 01:51:31.480
<v Speaker 3>but if you had to go to decision off of the injury,</v>

3992
01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:32.780
<v Speaker 3>you had got to give it to Moscow.</v>

3993
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Moscow was putting it to them.</v>

3994
01:51:36.170 --> 01:51:37.860
<v Speaker 3>My hospital had him in a lot of trouble,</v>

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:54.910
<v Speaker 3>You're so ruthless as a favor because I'm nosy,</v>

4005
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:55.744
<v Speaker 3>lighter.</v>

4006
01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:56.920
<v Speaker 3>You mark them as fast,</v>

4007
01:51:56.921 --> 01:51:57.250
<v Speaker 3>your kid.</v>

4008
01:51:57.250 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Hey guys,</v>

4009
01:51:58.151 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 3>let's look at it this way.</v>

4010
01:51:59.171 --> 01:52:00.490
<v Speaker 3>As a pres,</v>

4011
01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.680
<v Speaker 3>as people that love the sport,</v>

4012
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:05.110
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should redesign the bottom of the cage.</v>

4013
01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.093
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

4014
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.540
<v Speaker 3>it may be down for that,</v>

4015
01:52:07.541 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 3>but it's not his fault.</v>

4016
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:10.583
<v Speaker 3>It's not his fault.</v>

4017
01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.610
<v Speaker 3>This guy caught in the fence.</v>

4018
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this game.</v>

4019
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that part of the game ball still gets mad at you?</v>

4020
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:20.290
<v Speaker 3>You moved to the left and he fucking slides in and he gets his foot.</v>

4021
01:52:22.090 --> 01:52:22.871
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>

4022
01:52:22.871 --> 01:52:24.190
<v Speaker 3>As a person who's fought in the octagon,</v>

4023
01:52:24.191 --> 01:52:26.530
<v Speaker 3>is there an argument for extending the lip a little bit?</v>

4024
01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.150
<v Speaker 3>So instead of Tuck it,</v>

4025
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Tuck it up.</v>

4026
01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:30.560
<v Speaker 3>We'd be putting in a bar fish.</v>

4027
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 3>How many would you could only have to go up a few inches and it would remove the</v>

4028
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:35.630
<v Speaker 3>problem of the edge move,</v>

4029
01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.590
<v Speaker 3>but you wouldn't be able to use,</v>

4030
01:52:37.591 --> 01:52:38.720
<v Speaker 3>you know that take down a fence.</v>

4031
01:52:38.721 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 3>So this guys against the cage,</v>

4032
01:52:40.210 --> 01:52:41.660
<v Speaker 3>take your heels in twice.</v>

4033
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Well that's Kinda cheap too,</v>

4034
01:52:44.351 --> 01:52:44.950
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

4035
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 3>That body that caught oh</v>

4036
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:49.820
<v Speaker 1>well that would help everybody then everyone like having a little bit of a,</v>

4037
01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:51.020
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about that.</v>

4038
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Having a little bit of fabric pulled it through and up and connect it to the</v>

4039
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:56.144
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>

4040
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:57.470
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good thing.</v>

4041
01:52:57.471 --> 01:52:58.304
<v Speaker 1>So he slipped in there.</v>

4042
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4043
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:01.250
<v Speaker 1>It's awful fucking told.</v>

4044
01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:05.560
<v Speaker 1>He's getting punched in the head and he's still trying to get his phone up.</v>

4045
01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:06.261
<v Speaker 1>They don't cut them.</v>

4046
01:53:06.261 --> 01:53:06.981
<v Speaker 1>Give them one more.</v>

4047
01:53:06.981 --> 01:53:07.291
<v Speaker 1>It's flipped.</v>

4048
01:53:07.291 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>That kind of gave him 100% man.</v>

4049
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:12.260
<v Speaker 1>He just knocked out Matt Brown and he has his controversial,</v>

4050
01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:12.561
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4051
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:13.300
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>

4052
01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4053
01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:13.591
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

4054
01:53:13.591 --> 01:53:16.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll go by 100% here's the problem with the controversial injury.</v>

4055
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Mazda doll is the one who got robbed here cause Mosfet Woodall was putting it to</v>

4056
01:53:21.171 --> 01:53:22.370
<v Speaker 1>him before that he still gets,</v>

4057
01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:22.770
<v Speaker 1>he gets,</v>

4058
01:53:22.770 --> 01:53:23.310
<v Speaker 1>he won,</v>

4059
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.891
<v Speaker 1>they won.</v>

4060
01:53:23.891 --> 01:53:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But if it was a draw like dope,</v>

4061
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.380
<v Speaker 1>he's injured both guys.</v>

4062
01:53:27.381 --> 01:53:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel like both guys robbed got robbed a little bit and doesn't burn.</v>

4063
01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Got Robbed and potential for a comeback.</v>

4064
01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

4065
01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Justice was done because Mazda Bell who was winning and he still gets his wind</v>

4066
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:38.780
<v Speaker 1>bonus and Jake got you.</v>

4067
01:53:38.781 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not a happy justice.</v>

4068
01:53:40.071 --> 01:53:40.851
<v Speaker 1>It's not justice.</v>

4069
01:53:40.851 --> 01:53:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It makes them feel cheer and sewing.</v>

4070
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:44.140
<v Speaker 1>It feels not chair.</v>

4071
01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Who feels not changing?</v>

4072
01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 1>There'll be no singing.</v>

4073
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

4074
01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Zero but yeah,</v>

4075
01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

4076
01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:49.513
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

4077
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:52.040
<v Speaker 1>When you and Eddie were like going at it back and forth,</v>

4078
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm on both of your sides.</v>

4079
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:54.643
<v Speaker 1>I come and get him.</v>

4080
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.641
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

4081
01:53:55.641 --> 01:53:56.391
<v Speaker 1>Finger break.</v>

4082
01:53:56.391 --> 01:53:57.021
<v Speaker 1>It's a break.</v>

4083
01:53:57.021 --> 01:53:59.090
<v Speaker 1>It's through due to an attack.</v>

4084
01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4085
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:01.340
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

4086
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.920
<v Speaker 1>anytime you feel like you,</v>

4087
01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:04.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should stop the fight.</v>

4088
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You should stop the fight like almost every time for something like that.</v>

4089
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It should you let a guy go.</v>

4090
01:54:09.321 --> 01:54:10.250
<v Speaker 1>If you can't see it all,</v>

4091
01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:13.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever's right eye is 50 seconds left in the round,</v>

4092
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:14.270
<v Speaker 1>50 seconds.</v>

4093
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.133
<v Speaker 1>It's for the title.</v>

4094
01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:15.561
<v Speaker 1>The guys,</v>

4095
01:54:15.561 --> 01:54:16.394
<v Speaker 1>the champion,</v>

4096
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:16.911
<v Speaker 1>he can't see.</v>

4097
01:54:16.911 --> 01:54:17.630
<v Speaker 1>He says he's fine.</v>

4098
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:18.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

4099
01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Stop at Brendan.</v>

4100
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.233
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

4101
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question because sometimes guys go out and they win that case by</v>

4102
01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:23.791
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

4103
01:54:23.791 --> 01:54:24.560
<v Speaker 1>It's case by case.</v>

4104
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:25.281
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

4105
01:54:25.281 --> 01:54:25.761
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4106
01:54:25.761 --> 01:54:26.840
<v Speaker 1>It is not easy.</v>

4107
01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy,</v>

4108
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:30.223
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

4109
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying there's a fight and you're in there and you know what the magnitude</v>

4110
01:54:34.041 --> 01:54:37.580
<v Speaker 1>of that wind will do for your career and get you to next level and you're</v>

4111
01:54:37.581 --> 01:54:38.270
<v Speaker 1>punching and goes,</v>

4112
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:39.103
<v Speaker 1>damn dog you,</v>

4113
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you got me in the eye.</v>

4114
01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You're all about in the winter.</v>

4115
01:54:41.521 --> 01:54:41.781
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

4116
01:54:41.781 --> 01:54:42.210
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4117
01:54:42.210 --> 01:54:42.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4118
01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.131
<v Speaker 1>no Eddie,</v>

4119
01:54:43.131 --> 01:54:43.964
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

4120
01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:49.080
<v Speaker 1>You're a winner as motherfucker something with that comment.</v>

4121
01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:50.631
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

4122
01:54:50.631 --> 01:54:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Look you right in that,</v>

4123
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that you know that might be part of the problem,</v>

4124
01:54:54.261 --> 01:54:54.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4125
01:54:54.441 --> 01:54:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Like a killer instinct in the minutes it looks like,</v>

4126
01:54:57.681 --> 01:54:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

4127
01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not just the ethics of winning or losing or under the fair here get a</v>

4128
01:55:03.021 --> 01:55:03.800
<v Speaker 1>win and fighting,</v>

4129
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.420
<v Speaker 1>get out bonus and yeah.</v>

4130
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that an issue?</v>

4131
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Is when bonuses are when bonuses an issue.</v>

4132
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And did they ever exist in boxing before MMA started adopting them in boxing?</v>

4133
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:15.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

4134
01:55:15.291 --> 01:55:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to watch boxing.</v>

4135
01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:17.773
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

4136
01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4137
01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

4138
01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:19.993
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they are.</v>

4139
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4140
01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I think boxers they fight for a purse.</v>

4141
01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4142
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:24.530
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a flat fee.</v>

4143
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:26.000
<v Speaker 1>The flat fee.</v>

4144
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you got your paper if you bust.</v>

4145
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Is there an argument that when bonuses make the fights more exciting?</v>

4146
01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4147
01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you need them,</v>

4148

4149
01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.300
<v Speaker 1>cause cause people,</v>

4150
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously they're aware of women dentists,</v>

4151
01:55:37.301 --> 01:55:37.790
<v Speaker 1>but no one's like,</v>

4152
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:38.270
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

4153
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I gotta make this aside and I'm going to go do this because hopefully I get the</v>

4154
01:55:41.751 --> 01:55:42.310

4169
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:56.410
<v Speaker 5>He wants to get that money.</v>

4170
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:56.630

4183
01:56:14.670 --> 01:56:19.670
<v Speaker 5>hanging out with Tony Marx in big bear made me feel like a fucking little mouse.</v>

4184
01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.520
<v Speaker 5>Like Holy Shit.</v>

4185
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 5>Not only where is that?</v>

4186
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:30.030
<v Speaker 5>They thought it was gonna be an Anaheim,</v>

4187
01:56:30.031 --> 01:56:30.401
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

4188
01:56:30.401 --> 01:56:30.650
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4189
01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.201
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

4190

4192
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:33.240
<v Speaker 5>Remember they took,</v>

4193
01:56:33.241 --> 01:56:34.400
<v Speaker 5>they pulled the paper.</v>

4194
01:56:34.401 --> 01:56:35.011
<v Speaker 5>You from Manheim,</v>

01:56:36.110 --> 01:56:36.301
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4198
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:37.230
<v Speaker 5>They canceled Anaheim.</v>

4199
01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:37.410
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>

4200
01:56:37.410 --> 01:56:38.670
<v Speaker 5>When did it get cancelled today?</v>

4201
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.051
<v Speaker 5>Two days.</v>

4202
01:56:39.051 --> 01:56:39.380
<v Speaker 5>Can I have it?</v>

4203
01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:41.580
<v Speaker 5>So is that official Tony and Khabib?</v>

4204
01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:44.080
<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to be on the anum 800 cars</v>

4205
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:46.470

4206
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:47.160
<v Speaker 5>But that's the fight.</v>

4207
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:47.993
<v Speaker 5>But that's the fight.</v>

4208
01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.210
<v Speaker 5>Fight,</v>

4209
01:56:49.210 --> 01:56:50.043

01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:55.170
<v Speaker 5>Conor and wants to take some time off.</v>

4212
01:56:55.171 --> 01:56:56.730
<v Speaker 5>He's about to have his first child.</v>

4213
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:57.570
<v Speaker 5>Totally get it.</v>

4214
01:56:57.570 --> 01:56:59.730
<v Speaker 5>Tarnished fight is with WWE and Ari Emanuel.</v>

4215
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.030
<v Speaker 5>Tony keep saying that and it sounds like God damn mantra.</v>

4216
01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:04.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like Donald Trump KKK.</v>

4217
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:06.840
<v Speaker 5>How good that's going to be anti gay</v>

4219
01:57:12.961 --> 01:57:13.650
<v Speaker 5>The placard.</v>

4220
01:57:13.650 --> 01:57:14.580
<v Speaker 5>It's true though.</v>

4221
01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:15.600
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

4222
01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.433
<v Speaker 5>Dan's got</v>

4223
01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.290
<v Speaker 5>negotiation room.</v>

4224
01:57:19.291 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're in a good place.</v>

4225
01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:21.203
<v Speaker 5>Who's his girl?</v>

4226
01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:21.421
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4227
01:57:21.421 --> 01:57:22.590
<v Speaker 5>even if they're in a good place,</v>

4228
01:57:22.591 --> 01:57:23.370
<v Speaker 5>that's the fight.</v>

4229
01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:24.870
<v Speaker 5>You're a little bit of a gossiper.</v>

4230
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:25.763
<v Speaker 5>He like it</v>

4231
01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.650
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>

4232
01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 5>but hey,</v>

4233
01:57:31.831 --> 01:57:32.664
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

4234
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:37.770
<v Speaker 5>Robert Dinero was good fellas.</v>

4235
01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:38.893
<v Speaker 5>Guys out</v>

4236
01:57:40.610 --> 01:57:43.910
<v Speaker 5>little bet little bars when he says you were a</v>

4237
01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:47.580
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>

4238
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.130
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>

4239
01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:48.610
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>

4240
01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:49.830
<v Speaker 5>go get your shine box.</v>

4241
01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:54.270
<v Speaker 5>That's a great stabs him in the neck to the pen.</v>

4242
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:55.243
<v Speaker 5>Great team.</v>

4243
01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:56.253
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4244
01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.240
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

4245
01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:59.370
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not wrong because when Conor goes,</v>

4246
01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:00.600
<v Speaker 5>and I still have some inside info,</v>

4247
01:58:00.690 --> 01:58:01.523
<v Speaker 5>but when we caught him,</v>

4248
01:58:01.590 --> 01:58:02.850
<v Speaker 5>but when Conor goes,</v>

4249
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:03.870
<v Speaker 5>when Conor goes,</v>

4250
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.760
<v Speaker 5>I need a portion of the company now,</v>

4251
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:06.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm not finding,</v>

4252
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:07.183
<v Speaker 5>if you give me that,</v>

4253
01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:09.080
<v Speaker 5>who's his battle with Tony Ferguson?</v>

4254
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:10.170
<v Speaker 5>It could be they don't,</v>

4255
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 5>they have no ownership of that.</v>

4256
01:58:11.671 --> 01:58:12.900
<v Speaker 5>They don't have control of that.</v>

4257
01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 5>Here's why it's foolish to get a portion of the company because he,</v>

4258
01:58:17.761 --> 01:58:22.761
<v Speaker 5>by very nature of his dynamic being and presence makes the paper views that he's</v>

4259
01:58:23.730 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 5>on spectacular.</v>

4260
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:27.960
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't elevate the other paper views.</v>

4261
01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:30.160
<v Speaker 5>So when he's there is,</v>

4262
01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:30.700
<v Speaker 5>he was saying,</v>

4263
01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:32.220
<v Speaker 5>should you get a percentage of the paper views?</v>

4264
01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:33.780
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely does.</v>

4265
01:58:33.810 --> 01:58:34.650
<v Speaker 5>He does.</v>

4266
01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.750
<v Speaker 5>He should get a percentage of the company.</v>

4267
01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:39.720
<v Speaker 5>You would have to prove that you're making the company bigger.</v>

4268
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:40.201
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4269
01:58:40.201 --> 01:58:40.831
<v Speaker 5>you're not.</v>

4270
01:58:40.831 --> 01:58:42.190
<v Speaker 5>You're making yourself bigger.</v>

4271
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:43.121
<v Speaker 1>And he is.</v>

4272
01:58:43.121 --> 01:58:43.600
<v Speaker 1>He's by,</v>

4273
01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

4274
01:58:44.710 --> 01:58:46.180
<v Speaker 1>the most famous,</v>

4275
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but by four fights that he draws for,</v>

4276
01:58:49.361 --> 01:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>he will get compensated for an extraordinary manner.</v>

4277
01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.193
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>

4278
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:54.850
<v Speaker 1>the idea of him,</v>

4279
01:58:54.851 --> 01:58:59.851
<v Speaker 1>him being an owner of the entire company based on what he's able to do in his</v>

4280
01:59:00.341 --> 01:59:04.060
<v Speaker 1>own individual paper views is that would be foolhardy.</v>

4281
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:04.923
<v Speaker 1>But what about,</v>

4282
01:59:05.050 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 1>what about mark time,</v>

4283
01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:09.190
<v Speaker 1>obviously not a businessman,</v>

4284
01:59:10.690 --> 01:59:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but just what about Conor McGregor?</v>

4285
01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking he doesn't get paid paid Affleck and like he can be listened to</v>

4286
01:59:17.671 --> 01:59:18.580
<v Speaker 1>more in the country.</v>

4287
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Why did it not get pulled?</v>

4288
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Because it didn't have a fucking title fight.</v>

4289
01:59:21.881 --> 01:59:22.661
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

4290
01:59:22.661 --> 01:59:27.661
<v Speaker 1>That the UFC without gigantic stars like Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey or John</v>

4291
01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Jones or Petterson Holloway without the killers nobody wants to watch.</v>

4292
01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.033
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

4293
01:59:33.090 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

4294
01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Should be,</v>

4295
01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:36.610
<v Speaker 1>and I want to pay for pain killers,</v>

4296
01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:37.331
<v Speaker 1>part of guests,</v>

4297
01:59:37.331 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 1>superstars make the company that you can have some fights and colors by you</v>

4298
01:59:41.650 --> 01:59:42.460
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

4299
01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.730
<v Speaker 1>You can have some fights that are paper view fights without without world</v>

4300
01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:46.564
<v Speaker 1>champions on it.</v>

4301
01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:51.660
<v Speaker 1>It is totally possible if you had a bunch of Cowboy Matt Brown type fights on</v>

4302
01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and you know just a bunch of them and none of them for the world title.</v>

4303
01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me what new watch you tell me when you watch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You tell me you would watch that.</v>

4308
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:03.750

4313
02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Daddy knows what's up.</v>

4314
02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:24.093
<v Speaker 1>Info wars.</v>

4315
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:25.451

4317
02:00:26.531 --> 02:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Meek.</v>

4318
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fucking join.</v>

4319
02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Kt Kelvin Jordan Meehan on Cyborg.</v>

4320
02:00:32.411 --> 02:00:37.411
<v Speaker 1>The male Cyborg in Strikeforce landed one of the most devastating fucking elbow</v>

4321
02:00:37.601 --> 02:00:42.601
<v Speaker 1>combinations to put outside Borg and Amil Meek is a guy who beat up to keen</v>

4322
02:00:43.031 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>mule.</v>

4323
02:00:43.690 --> 02:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out to Kenya when he first got kicked out of the UFC.</v>

4324
02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:48.611
<v Speaker 1>When who's smart?</v>

4325
02:00:48.611 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Paul Horez got kicked out of the UFC.</v>

4326
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>He fought this mad viking and meal meek.</v>

4327
02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>He'd beat the fuck out of him.</v>

4328
02:00:53.831 --> 02:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>He killed him in the first round.</v>

4329
02:00:55.150 --> 02:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>What's Turkeys Code?</v>

4330
02:00:58.090 --> 02:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>He keeps hitting KOD cause he had been pictures legs off and Emma and Jujitsu.</v>

4331
02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>He fought Gary Cohn.</v>

4332
02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Tonin in a straight up traditional went to draw.</v>

4333
02:01:06.191 --> 02:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>But Gary Tonin was dominating.</v>

4334
02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:08.861
<v Speaker 1>Gary.</v>

4335
02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Tony was attacking him way more than he was tapped.</v>

4336
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>How scary to Keno was for a while.</v>

4337
02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:13.721
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing,</v>

4338
02:01:13.721 --> 02:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tonin is maybe 30 pounds lighter than I am.</v>

4339
02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>No Bush won best in the world.</v>

4340
02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying and crass Chino was Paula Harris.</v>

4341
02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers were terrified.</v>

4342
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>You know why I was fascinated about that fight was not just the Gary tone as a</v>

4343
02:01:29.711 --> 02:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

4344
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.140
<v Speaker 1>but that John Donahoe and I had this conversation about the entrances that uh,</v>

4345
02:01:35.230 --> 02:01:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo uses,</v>

4346
02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:36.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4347
02:01:36.971 --> 02:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like the entrance is how he,</v>

4348
02:01:38.770 --> 02:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>how he establishes the entrance into his techniques that he has like some pretty</v>

4349
02:01:42.561 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>obvious entrances.</v>

4350
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.781
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4351
02:01:44.781 --> 02:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of basic in the way he approaches leg locks and like his,</v>

4352
02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>his take was that they would always be like one step ahead of them.</v>

4353
02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I mentioned,</v>

4354
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>the strength would run out and recommend cause you,</v>

4355
02:01:56.251 --> 02:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you can see it coming so you know how to stop it.</v>

4356
02:01:58.430 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how high level and sophisticated that whole Eddie Cummings Yup.</v>

4357
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.101
<v Speaker 1>Hands up.</v>

4358
02:02:04.101 --> 02:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Well it's John Danaher is a big part of it.</v>

4359
02:02:06.230 --> 02:02:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4360
02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:07.371
<v Speaker 1>But he was also,</v>

4361
02:02:07.371 --> 02:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton of guys,</v>

4362
02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister contributed to that in a big way because he came over there.</v>

4363
02:02:12.081 --> 02:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

4364
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of leg lock knowledge that came out of there,</v>

4365
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>but even so,</v>

4403
02:03:23.230 --> 02:03:25.420
<v Speaker 4>highly complex leg lock system and,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4407
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:30.160
<v Speaker 4>came out,</v>

4408
02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.540
<v Speaker 4>that's when it was exposed and me as a teacher,</v>

4409
02:03:34.541 --> 02:03:35.110
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

4410
02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:35.531
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

4411
02:03:35.531 --> 02:03:40.090
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was already a leg lock friendly enough.</v>

4412
02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:44.700
<v Speaker 4>I had a bunch of leg lock wizards all over the association there were there</v>

4413
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:45.331
<v Speaker 4>everyone I thought,</v>

4414
02:03:45.331 --> 02:03:45.630
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4415
02:03:45.630 --> 02:03:47.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally open on leg locks.</v>

4416
02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:48.341
<v Speaker 4>Me Personally,</v>

4417
02:03:48.341 --> 02:03:49.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not heavy into heel hooks,</v>

4418
02:03:49.841 --> 02:03:50.770
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

4419
02:03:50.771 --> 02:03:55.771
<v Speaker 4>I love the fact that every class has like three heel hook fucking just dudes</v>

4420
02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:56.830
<v Speaker 4>that are obsessed with it.</v>

4421
02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:57.731
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4422
02:03:57.731 --> 02:03:59.440
<v Speaker 4>but that wasn't enough once Abi came,</v>

4423
02:03:59.450 --> 02:03:59.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4424
02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.650
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't enough liquid.</v>

4425
02:04:02.651 --> 02:04:03.370
<v Speaker 4>These guys,</v>

4426
02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:08.370
<v Speaker 4>when you obsess with leg locks in the system and every possibility in every</v>

4427
02:04:08.591 --> 02:04:12.430
<v Speaker 4>counter and the way Danaher's put that system together,</v>

4428
02:04:12.431 --> 02:04:13.240
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4429

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:44.921
<v Speaker 2>You feel it.</v>

4479
02:05:44.921 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 2>You feel like that that's what did you feel like you were,</v>

4480
02:05:48.130 --> 02:05:50.540
<v Speaker 2>at what point when you were rolling Jujitsu,</v>

4481
02:05:50.550 --> 02:05:55.550
<v Speaker 2>did you feel like it became more art than sport in that you were improvising as</v>

4482
02:05:56.851 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you went along in that everything was a reaction.</v>

4483
02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Everything was sort of predicated by your mindset,</v>

4484
02:06:02.671 --> 02:06:03.570
<v Speaker 2>your mood,</v>

4485
02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:04.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4486
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:05.340
<v Speaker 2>of that day,</v>

4487
02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:08.900
<v Speaker 2>what that person was doing and do what the mood of the day that I could tell it</v>

4488
02:06:08.901 --> 02:06:12.870
<v Speaker 2>had to do with it just had to do with how many times can you do a movement and,</v>

4489
02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:14.100
<v Speaker 2>and train your body,</v>

4490
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:17.340
<v Speaker 2>your body at whatever you do,</v>

4491
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:20.610
<v Speaker 2>tell became backs,</v>

4492
02:06:20.611 --> 02:06:21.211
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

4493
02:06:21.211 --> 02:06:22.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever you do.</v>

4494
02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.150
<v Speaker 2>If you do it over and over and over again.</v>

4495
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:27.930
<v Speaker 2>If you're working in a factory and you got a job or you're doing something,</v>

4496
02:06:28.110 --> 02:06:28.950
<v Speaker 2>the more you do it,</v>

4497
02:06:28.951 --> 02:06:29.551
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

4498
02:06:29.551 --> 02:06:31.050
<v Speaker 2>putting this contraption here,</v>

4499
02:06:31.230 --> 02:06:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be so fucking good at it.</v>

4500
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Pam,</v>

4501
02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.220
<v Speaker 2>your body is,</v>

4502
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:39.360
<v Speaker 2>will master anything you tell it to do a thousand times,</v>

4503
02:06:39.361 --> 02:06:40.194
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4504
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:42.360
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes a language you're flowing in that you're,</v>

4505
02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:43.470
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

4506
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 2>physically that you know.</v>

4507
02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4508
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4509
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:47.420
<v Speaker 2>so it's like in the</v>

4510
02:06:49.810 --> 02:06:52.770
<v Speaker 2>a building fucking blocks,</v>

4511
02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:54.600
<v Speaker 2>the factory work and whatever,</v>

4512
02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:55.860
<v Speaker 2>it's all about numbers.</v>

4513
02:06:55.861 --> 02:06:58.080
<v Speaker 2>It's just practice makes perfect.</v>

4514
02:06:58.081 --> 02:07:03.081
<v Speaker 2>It's just how the more you do what your body will end up doing it magically and</v>

4515
02:07:03.331 --> 02:07:06.600
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to just kind of like executive produce things and your body just</v>

4516
02:07:06.601 --> 02:07:07.560
<v Speaker 2>doesn't magically like,</v>

4517
02:07:07.770 --> 02:07:08.603
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>

4518
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:10.380
<v Speaker 2>like tying your shoes,</v>

4519
02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:15.040
<v Speaker 2>like playing violin when you're shredding on violin or a piano or whatever type</v>

4520
02:07:15.041 --> 02:07:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Brian or type that shit typing.</v>

4521
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:18.971
<v Speaker 2>When you type it,</v>

4522
02:07:18.971 --> 02:07:22.860
<v Speaker 2>you just sort of thinking like now I've been typing for so many years and not,</v>

4523
02:07:22.861 --> 02:07:24.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not perfect match a fuck up.</v>

4524
02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:25.080
<v Speaker 2>But when I type,</v>

4525
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:26.130
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in the groove,</v>

4526
02:07:26.150 --> 02:07:26.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4527
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking at the screen of thinking and then the words just start,</v>

4528
02:07:29.881 --> 02:07:30.810
<v Speaker 2>my fingers start moving.</v>

4529
02:07:30.811 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It's weird you send it because I was typing and my father said,</v>

4530
02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

4531
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:36.003
<v Speaker 2>you type fast,</v>

4532
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:37.270
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't even dawn on me.</v>

4533
02:07:37.271 --> 02:07:37.661
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4534
02:07:37.661 --> 02:07:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

4535
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what Dan has done.</v>

4536
02:07:39.210 --> 02:07:41.830
<v Speaker 2>We learned that's what they've done.</v>

4537
02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:44.080
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten a system down and they,</v>

4538
02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:44.801
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>

4539
02:07:44.801 --> 02:07:45.011
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>

4540
02:07:45.011 --> 02:07:47.320

4541
02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4542
02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:50.830
<v Speaker 2>And they understand that perfect practice makes perfect.</v>

4543
02:07:50.831 --> 02:07:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4544
02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:51.891
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4545
02:07:51.891 --> 02:07:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4546
02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:52.820
<v Speaker 2>That's even better.</v>

4547
02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:53.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4548
02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:53.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4549
02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I love that about life.</v>

4550
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I love that about the idea that you can master something that you definitely</v>

4551
02:07:58.511 --> 02:07:59.070
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

4552
02:07:59.070 --> 02:07:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4553
02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean you get better at anything.</v>

4554
02:08:01.151 --> 02:08:02.310
<v Speaker 2>You put your time too.</v>

4555
02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>If you don't get perfect,</v>

4556
02:08:03.281 --> 02:08:04.330
<v Speaker 2>it's so worthwhile.</v>

4557
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Does never ever endeavoring down that road that the reaching for it is,</v>

4558
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:10.210
<v Speaker 2>is the whole lesson,</v>

4559
02:08:10.211 --> 02:08:10.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4560

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4561
02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:11.890

4562
02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4563
02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:14.110

<v Speaker 2>So you know what,</v>

4591
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 2>like this conversation that happened in the beginning of this podcast when</v>

4592
02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:06.670
<v Speaker 2>everybody went crazy.</v>

4593
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're like the best trends.</v>

4595
02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel bad about it.</v>

4596
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:11.080
<v Speaker 2>You guys don't feel bad about it.</v>

4597
02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit,</v>

4598
02:09:11.730 --> 02:09:12.563
<v Speaker 2>but here's the</v>

4599
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:14.771
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

4600
02:09:14.771 --> 02:09:15.131
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4601
02:09:15.131 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 2>is that thing that like people have to understand you.</v>

4602
02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:20.680
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to disagree about shit and still be cool.</v>

4603
02:09:20.770 --> 02:09:21.730
<v Speaker 2>You could be both.</v>

4604
02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:22.653
<v Speaker 2>Well not only that,</v>

4605
02:09:22.670 --> 02:09:24.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to disagree with something and go,</v>

4606
02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:25.810
<v Speaker 2>you're cause you're a fucking retard.</v>

4607
02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:30.840
<v Speaker 2>That's why every fucking look at is Eddie is Eddie wants to solve a problem and</v>

4608
02:09:31.001 --> 02:09:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Eddie like when I think</v>

4609
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:35.410
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go deep into the router.</v>

4610
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:37.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4611
02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:37.751
<v Speaker 2>not doing that.</v>

4612
02:09:37.751 --> 02:09:38.584
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

4613
02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:42.283
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4614
02:09:43.090 --> 02:09:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Listen everyone.</v>

4615
02:09:44.141 --> 02:09:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Listen.</v>

4616
02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:48.610
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is that when somebody is passionate and cares about the world</v>

4617
02:09:48.611 --> 02:09:50.830
<v Speaker 2>and wants a world to be a better place like he does,</v>

4618
02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:52.870
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's coming on the same team.</v>

4619
02:09:52.871 --> 02:09:53.410
<v Speaker 2>That's where it,</v>

4620
02:09:53.410 --> 02:09:53.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4621
02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:54.820
<v Speaker 2>So when you know that,</v>

4622
02:09:54.821 --> 02:09:57.670
<v Speaker 2>when you know that he's genuinely a good person through his fucking core,</v>

4623
02:09:57.671 --> 02:09:58.840
<v Speaker 2>which I know that about him,</v>

4624
02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:01.590
<v Speaker 2>like Eddie seven different point of view.</v>

4625
02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I've texted Eddie about,</v>

4626
02:10:02.671 --> 02:10:03.221
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way.</v>

4627
02:10:03.221 --> 02:10:05.760
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I'm going to look at Eddie is like that.</v>

4628
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:06.431
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

4629
02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:06.940
<v Speaker 2>What do I said?</v>

4632
02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Is this the bottom line is I think they are fucking us,</v>

02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.961
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4862
02:16:27.961 --> 02:16:28.860
<v Speaker 5>here's the problem.</v>

4863
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:30.400
<v Speaker 5>The damage done.</v>

4864
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4865
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:34.130
<v Speaker 3>Benevidez is legit as far as like it diminishes him.</v>

4866
02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 3>So that is worth more than a point on his,</v>

4867
02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:39.640
<v Speaker 3>his potential performance.</v>

4868
02:16:39.641 --> 02:16:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Same with an eye poke.</v>

4869
02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4870
02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:42.520
<v Speaker 3>got to get my books even worse.</v>

4871
02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:43.920
<v Speaker 3>I poke right away.</v>

4872
02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Should be a point taken away.</v>

4873
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I think you're 100% correct.</v>

4874
02:16:46.391 --> 02:16:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It changes the magnitude of the fight.</v>

4875
02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:48.551
<v Speaker 3>I agree with him.</v>

4876
02:16:48.551 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 3>100% agreed with him.</v>

4877
02:16:50.321 --> 02:16:53.320
<v Speaker 3>100% Eddie Bravo thinks that Brian count is a bar.</v>

4878
02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I think he's gotten so drunk.</v>

4879
02:16:54.941 --> 02:16:57.040
<v Speaker 3>He's just holding as Gladys out to Brian.</v>

4880
02:16:57.041 --> 02:16:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Callan is not even looking at him.</v>

4881
02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Shab who's a loving that point.</v>

4882
02:17:01.631 --> 02:17:02.464
<v Speaker 3>You've got to pull out</v>

4883
02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post for a driver.</v>

4884
02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:08.570
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

4885
02:17:08.570 --> 02:17:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4886
02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Mantra.</v>

4887
02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:11.020
<v Speaker 3>You can throw those kicks like that.</v>

4888
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:12.610
<v Speaker 3>You can't and you're not disciplined enough.</v>

4889
02:17:12.611 --> 02:17:13.570
<v Speaker 3>You can't throw the kicks.</v>

4890
02:17:13.710 --> 02:17:15.440
<v Speaker 3>They're moving targets.</v>

4891
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Taekwondo in 10th grade.</v>

4892
02:17:18.311 --> 02:17:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Say Stop It.</v>

4893
02:17:19.010 --> 02:17:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Those kids moved a little too tiny</v>

4894
02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:25.870
<v Speaker 3>quiet in 10th grade.</v>

4895
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm just picturing guys named Chad with no fucking facial hair at this balance</v>

4896
02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:32.210
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

4897
02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:32.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4898
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:33.720
<v Speaker 3>I said switches.</v>

4899
02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Dances with no fucking plan for the fences.</v>

4900
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Random colored belt.</v>

4901
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:40.151
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4902
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.080
<v Speaker 3>this fight is awesome.</v>

4903
02:17:41.410 --> 02:17:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Bra.</v>

4904
02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:42.371
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

4905
02:17:42.371 --> 02:17:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Walking him down pissed because his last fight off suitors.</v>

4906
02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Demetrius Johnson got annihilated.</v>

4907
02:17:46.890 --> 02:17:51.670
<v Speaker 3>So these also probably pissed because he's lost one point already in this first</v>

4908
02:17:51.671 --> 02:17:51.971
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>

4909
02:17:51.971 --> 02:17:52.661
<v Speaker 3>so he's got a wind.</v>

4910
02:17:52.661 --> 02:17:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Significantly.</v>

4911
02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Brian would be a draw because if he's with one point he's been winning the whole</v>

4912
02:17:57.281 --> 02:18:00.730
<v Speaker 3>fight less Benevidez does something strong and which he'll when it,</v>

4913
02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:02.230
<v Speaker 3>oh crap,</v>

4914
02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:03.310
<v Speaker 3>but you know what man?</v>

4915
02:18:03.311 --> 02:18:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes some people take a point away.</v>

4916
02:18:04.751 --> 02:18:05.710
<v Speaker 3>They automatically say,</v>

4917
02:18:05.711 --> 02:18:07.930
<v Speaker 3>well that guy is losing the fight now.</v>

4918
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Like it's almost like a psychological thing.</v>

4919
02:18:09.850 --> 02:18:11.890
<v Speaker 3>The judges are tough man by tough.</v>

4920
02:18:11.891 --> 02:18:12.724
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>

4921
02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:13.930
<v Speaker 3>some of them are not good.</v>

4922
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:14.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4923
02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:15.220
<v Speaker 3>some of them are not good.</v>

4924
02:18:15.510 --> 02:18:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Some of them definitely not good.</v>

4925
02:18:17.290 --> 02:18:18.123
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>

4926
02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:21.340
<v Speaker 3>What did you think of the Tyron Woodley Wonderboy fight?</v>

4927
02:18:21.341 --> 02:18:22.174
<v Speaker 3>Have you watched that fight?</v>

4928
02:18:22.410 --> 02:18:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I called it a judge.</v>

4929
02:18:24.010 --> 02:18:24.843
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

4930
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:26.051
<v Speaker 3>I think you were Brian,</v>

4931
02:18:26.051 --> 02:18:27.310
<v Speaker 3>what I say to you before,</v>

4932
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:28.300
<v Speaker 3>before they came out,</v>

4933
02:18:28.301 --> 02:18:29.134
<v Speaker 3>when he was my,</v>

4934
02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:29.973
<v Speaker 3>my thinking,</v>

4935
02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it's only a draw because we look at fights wrong.</v>

4936
02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.900
<v Speaker 3>I think Woodley one because he did a way more way more damage,</v>

4937
02:18:37.901 --> 02:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>way more knocked them down.</v>

4938
02:18:39.350 --> 02:18:40.183
<v Speaker 3>You're the fight.</v>

4939
02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:41.320
<v Speaker 3>How about that kid he had,</v>

4940
02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:45.090
<v Speaker 3>he had moments of total dominance like that first round when he got on top of</v>

4941
02:18:45.091 --> 02:18:45.220
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4942
02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:48.280
<v Speaker 3>There was never a point where Wonderboy was running the fight and it was a vat</v>

4943
02:18:48.281 --> 02:18:48.830
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>

4944
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:50.890
<v Speaker 3>There should be like a point aspect to that.</v>

4945
02:18:50.891 --> 02:18:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

4946
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:51.911
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

4947
02:18:51.911 --> 02:18:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

4948
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:53.060
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

4949
02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I used to this moments where you're like maybe like you land a jab and he lands</v>

4950
02:18:56.831 --> 02:18:59.050
<v Speaker 3>a leg kick and what's better and what's worse.</v>

4951
02:18:59.051 --> 02:19:00.160
<v Speaker 3>And there's a debatable moment.</v>

4952
02:19:00.250 --> 02:19:03.160
<v Speaker 3>But when Woodley took him down and beat him up with the first round and smashes</v>

4953
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:04.000
<v Speaker 3>nose open,</v>

4954
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that was a significant and the guilty.</v>

4955
02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:09.540
<v Speaker 3>How about the punches that led to the Guillotine?</v>

4956
02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:09.841
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4957
02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:10.360
<v Speaker 3>It had him hurt.</v>

4958
02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Almost had him finished.</v>

4959
02:19:11.231 --> 02:19:13.690
<v Speaker 3>So he made a mistake going for the guilty.</v>

4960
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:16.270
<v Speaker 3>He probably did fine.</v>

4961
02:19:16.450 --> 02:19:16.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4962
02:19:16.691 --> 02:19:17.290
<v Speaker 3>you're probably right.</v>

4963
02:19:17.290 --> 02:19:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's watch this fight.</v>

4964
02:19:18.221 --> 02:19:19.410
<v Speaker 3>You Fuck No.</v>

4965
02:19:19.430 --> 02:19:22.000
<v Speaker 3>But to Joe's point is my hand right now,</v>

4966
02:19:22.001 --> 02:19:22.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4967
02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:26.380
<v Speaker 3>I won the fight in fight aspects.</v>

4968
02:19:26.381 --> 02:19:27.214
<v Speaker 3>He won the fight.</v>

4969
02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Some shit</v>

4970
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:31.010
<v Speaker 5>that happened that he's right and he's right.</v>

4971
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:32.203
<v Speaker 5>You're both right.</v>

4972
02:19:32.490 --> 02:19:33.111
<v Speaker 5>And any problems,</v>

4973
02:19:33.111 --> 02:19:36.660
<v Speaker 5>the voice of reason who to fucking ever thought these guys are having 15 bands.</v>

4974
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:37.530
<v Speaker 5>That's why for now,</v>

4975
02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:42.670
<v Speaker 5>really way one third and they're amazing.</v>

4976
02:19:42.671 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 5>But there was a bed shut the fuck Yo.</v>

4977
02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:46.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean Brandon got dammit.</v>

4978
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:47.750
<v Speaker 5>You fucking giant.</v>

4979
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Giant privilege.</v>

4980
02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Giant privilege.</v>

4981
02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:53.510
<v Speaker 5>The viewers would agree with me.</v>

4982
02:19:53.511 --> 02:19:57.560
<v Speaker 5>He left writing critically different male privilege and giant privilege.</v>

4983
02:19:57.561 --> 02:19:58.750
<v Speaker 5>You're a disgusting humans.</v>

4984
02:19:58.751 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing bad ever happened to him.</v>

4985
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:02.660
<v Speaker 5>He's never had any bad.</v>

4986
02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 5>You have four thirsty blues of white privilege.</v>

4987
02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:07.810
<v Speaker 5>You have big Dick Privilege,</v>

4988
02:20:09.730 --> 02:20:10.550
<v Speaker 5>podcasts,</v>

4989
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:11.480
<v Speaker 5>privilege.</v>

4990
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:12.230
<v Speaker 5>It's got it all.</v>

4991
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:13.580
<v Speaker 5>You're the son of a bitch.</v>

4992
02:20:13.581 --> 02:20:17.140
<v Speaker 5>I knew that John Privilege so stupid.</v>

4993
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.781
<v Speaker 5>Son of a bitch.</v>

4994
02:20:17.781 --> 02:20:19.490
<v Speaker 5>He's like a fucking son of a bitch.</v>

4995
02:20:19.491 --> 02:20:20.271
<v Speaker 5>Shut the 10 years.</v>

4996
02:20:20.271 --> 02:20:21.560
<v Speaker 5>Move out of the way out of a bitch.</v>

4997
02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:22.200
<v Speaker 5>Fuck her.</v>

4998
02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:22.900
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be that,</v>

4999
02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:23.661
<v Speaker 5>that one night,</v>

5000
02:20:23.661 --> 02:20:23.931
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

5001
02:20:23.931 --> 02:20:24.890
<v Speaker 5>when he can't follow them.</v>

5002
02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:26.600
<v Speaker 5>I know you son of a bitch.</v>

02:22:08.601 --> 02:22:09.434
<v Speaker 5>Keep that left hand.</v>

5068
02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:12.070
<v Speaker 5>Right hand man.</v>

5069
02:22:12.071 --> 02:22:12.904
<v Speaker 5>A boy.</v>

5070
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:13.730
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

5071
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:14.630
<v Speaker 5>So who does winning?</v>

5072
02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:15.513
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5073
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:17.150
<v Speaker 5>So who to looks pissed.</v>

5074
02:22:17.151 --> 02:22:17.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm nursing him.</v>

5075
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:19.330
<v Speaker 5>Fight with this much bad.</v>

5076
02:22:19.770 --> 02:22:22.880
<v Speaker 5>They've worked alongside each other for a long time and talked to a lot of shit</v>

5077
02:22:22.881 --> 02:22:23.440
<v Speaker 5>to each other.</v>

5078
02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:26.280
<v Speaker 5>Well Joe keeps swaying for that right hand counter.</v>

5079
02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Just lights a little off tonight.</v>

5080
02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:27.601
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5081
02:22:27.601 --> 02:22:31.620
<v Speaker 1>well he's probably been tagged a few times that first round and now he's looking</v>

5082
02:22:31.621 --> 02:22:33.720
<v Speaker 1>for that big right hand and get things back.</v>

5083
02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:35.550
<v Speaker 1>The reason I thought Joe would win this fight,</v>

5084
02:22:35.551 --> 02:22:36.750
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying he's not going to,</v>

5085
02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:40.170
<v Speaker 1>he does everything really well and pseudo does a few things.</v>

5086
02:22:40.171 --> 02:22:41.004
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

5087
02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:44.550
<v Speaker 1>So I thought Joe would kind of edge it out with just mixing it up,</v>

5088
02:22:44.551 --> 02:22:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but he's not doing that well.</v>

5089
02:22:45.841 --> 02:22:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So who always doing a stone where near the level of experience other than the</v>

5090
02:22:50.401 --> 02:22:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Johnson fight.</v>

5091
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Seven fights.</v>

5092
02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5093
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5094
02:22:53.581 --> 02:22:56.310
<v Speaker 1>and Benevidez is fought Johnson a couple of times.</v>

5095
02:22:57.330 --> 02:22:57.511
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

5096
02:22:57.511 --> 02:22:58.321
<v Speaker 1>how about that one?</v>

5097
02:22:58.321 --> 02:22:58.790
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

5098
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:59.940
<v Speaker 1>God damn mighty mouse,</v>

5099
02:23:00.090 --> 02:23:01.190
<v Speaker 1>mighty mouse from mercy,</v>

5100
02:23:03.090 --> 02:23:04.290
<v Speaker 1>he worked both of these guys.</v>

5101
02:23:04.530 --> 02:23:05.370
<v Speaker 1>So who do I mean?</v>

5102
02:23:05.371 --> 02:23:06.204
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

5103
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:10.080
<v Speaker 1>how many did he knock out joy Benevidez oh yeah.</v>

5104
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5105
02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:11.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5106
02:23:11.221 --> 02:23:12.054
<v Speaker 1>He crushed him,</v>

5107
02:23:12.570 --> 02:23:12.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5108
02:23:12.871 --> 02:23:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and then what he did this or Huda was pretty God damn impressive to some</v>

5109
02:23:15.961 --> 02:23:16.794
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

5110
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:21.360
<v Speaker 1>beautiful down to the technical kicks or knees rather to the body.</v>

5111
02:23:21.390 --> 02:23:23.010
<v Speaker 1>The morning time from the clench.</v>

5112
02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was perfect.</v>

5113
02:23:23.941 --> 02:23:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear what mighty mouse said before that fight?</v>

5114
02:23:25.621 --> 02:23:25.831
<v Speaker 1>They went,</v>

5115
02:23:25.831 --> 02:23:26.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5116
02:23:26.071 --> 02:23:27.760
<v Speaker 1>he is an Olympic gold medalist and rested.</v>

5117
02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 1>He went,</v>

5118
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:30.480
<v Speaker 1>there's 250 gold medalists.</v>

5119
02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:31.620
<v Speaker 1>There's one,</v>

5120
02:23:31.930 --> 02:23:32.370

02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:35.693
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

5123
02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5124
02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5125
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:40.560
<v Speaker 1>So legit love mighty mouse.</v>

5126
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I've been singing mighty mouse is praises forever.</v>

5127
02:23:43.210 --> 02:23:44.610
<v Speaker 1>He's not by pound for pound number one.</v>

5128
02:23:46.210 --> 02:23:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Who's your pound for pound number one?</v>

5129
02:23:47.671 --> 02:23:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones over Conor Mcgregor.</v>

5130
02:23:50.430 --> 02:23:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5131
02:23:50.660 --> 02:23:50.910
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5132
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:51.870
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say that,</v>

5133
02:23:51.871 --> 02:23:52.710
<v Speaker 1>but here's what I think.</v>

5134
02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:53.820
<v Speaker 1>When you look at John Jones,</v>

5135
02:23:53.821 --> 02:23:54.654
<v Speaker 1>I think Jon Jones,</v>

5136
02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:54.771
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5137
02:23:54.771 --> 02:23:57.360
<v Speaker 1>ultimately it absolutely has a potential to be number one,</v>

5138
02:23:57.540 --> 02:24:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but he's been to inactive and the fight with OVN St Prue,</v>

5139
02:24:00.991 --> 02:24:01.890
<v Speaker 1>although Ovince Saint [inaudible],</v>

5140
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it fills a very good fighter.</v>

5141
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a very tough fight.</v>

5142
02:24:04.470 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 1>If you look at who has beaten over and Saint Pru and who,</v>

5143
02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:11.210
<v Speaker 1>you know how John Jones looked against [inaudible] one five,</v>

5144
02:24:11.211 --> 02:24:11.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5145
02:24:11.491 --> 02:24:13.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't tow entirely by,</v>

5146
02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:14.880
<v Speaker 1>but as of late,</v>

5147
02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.070
<v Speaker 1>he's been incredibly inactive.</v>

5148
02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Cla has been not change</v>

5149
02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:25.650
<v Speaker 1>when you mighty mouse has been active.</v>

5150
02:24:25.651 --> 02:24:27.480
<v Speaker 1>He's been spectacular.</v>

5151
02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:28.770
<v Speaker 1>He's been spectacular.</v>

5152
02:24:28.771 --> 02:24:30.840
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is we've seen mighty mouse lose.</v>

5153
02:24:30.841 --> 02:24:32.160
<v Speaker 1>We've never seen John Jones Lewis.</v>

5154
02:24:32.161 --> 02:24:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

5155
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:32.911
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5156
02:24:32.911 --> 02:24:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you guys are missing a great fight.</v>

5157
02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

5158
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:35.850
<v Speaker 1>But he's not fun.</v>

5159
02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And also what mighty mouse is,</v>

5160
02:24:38.010 --> 02:24:40.380
<v Speaker 1>he can he and make a mistake at punch with right hand.</v>

5161
02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:41.460
<v Speaker 1>There are 125 pounds.</v>

5162
02:24:41.461 --> 02:24:41.911
<v Speaker 1>They keep on,</v>

5163
02:24:41.911 --> 02:24:42.450
<v Speaker 1>keep on.</v>

5164
02:24:42.450 --> 02:24:47.450
<v Speaker 1>John Jones makes one mistake and [inaudible] he fell because classes,</v>

5165
02:24:47.941 --> 02:24:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a pound for pound number one.</v>

5166
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:50.270
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

5167
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It did as a good argument except for guys like John Lennon grew and knock guys</v>

5168
02:24:54.961 --> 02:24:58.390
<v Speaker 1>out with one punch and mighty mouse who knocked out Benevidez with one pot.</v>

5169
02:24:58.391 --> 02:24:59.610
<v Speaker 1>It's still different than it is.</v>

5170
02:24:59.611 --> 02:25:00.121
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

5171
02:25:00.121 --> 02:25:01.140
<v Speaker 1>205 pounds.</v>

5172
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Your rosters,</v>

5173
02:25:02.250 --> 02:25:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

5174
02:25:02.730 --> 02:25:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit different.</v>

5175
02:25:03.810 --> 02:25:04.530
<v Speaker 1>He's a little bit,</v>

5176
02:25:04.530 --> 02:25:06.600
<v Speaker 1>have you forgotten about a guy named Anderson Silva?</v>

5177
02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Brian Callen coming in and fucking shut.</v>

5178
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:09.833
<v Speaker 1>Shut it down.</v>

5179
02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:10.840
<v Speaker 1>What about gas pump?</v>

5180
02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:11.773
<v Speaker 1>The best ever.</v>

5181
02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's entirely possible to make the case of either fade or Anderson</v>

5182
02:25:19.170 --> 02:25:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Silva or mighty mouse.</v>

5183
02:25:20.490 --> 02:25:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I make the case chest pain.</v>

5184
02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if he didn't lose</v>

5185
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.150
<v Speaker 3>his last STP,</v>

5186
02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:27.450
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

5187
02:25:27.450 --> 02:25:29.620
<v Speaker 3>but not for doing junior fight.</v>

5188
02:25:29.621 --> 02:25:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva who finished everybody.</v>

5189
02:25:31.271 --> 02:25:33.760
<v Speaker 3>It's arguable that for Jim's the best heavyweight of all time you can make</v>

5190
02:25:33.770 --> 02:25:34.010
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

5191
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.781
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm arguing.</v>

5192
02:25:34.781 --> 02:25:35.321
<v Speaker 3>Not Pound from.</v>

5193
02:25:35.321 --> 02:25:36.154
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

5194
02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Heavyweight.</v>

5195
02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5196
02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:37.781
<v Speaker 3>Pound for pound.</v>

5197
02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 3>John Mighty mouse.</v>

5198
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5199
02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:40.300
<v Speaker 3>you can put Connor up there.</v>

5200
02:25:40.370 --> 02:25:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5201
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Connors and argument</v>

5202
02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:45.821
<v Speaker 3>on something that was,</v>

5203
02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:48.010
<v Speaker 3>don't you think he's the number one fighter of all time?</v>

5204
02:25:48.011 --> 02:25:48.611
<v Speaker 3>As far as like,</v>

5205
02:25:48.611 --> 02:25:48.880
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5206
02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I think finishing everybody think Gianna's with style.</v>

5207
02:25:51.751 --> 02:25:52.211
<v Speaker 3>The way he did.</v>

5208
02:25:52.211 --> 02:25:53.380
<v Speaker 3>What are we talking about here?</v>

5209
02:25:53.410 --> 02:25:53.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5210
02:25:53.650 --> 02:25:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about stepping up.</v>

5211
02:25:55.031 --> 02:25:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Everybody know that.</v>

5212
02:25:56.110 --> 02:26:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about striking can visibly see when he's corner countering</v>

5213
02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:02.950
<v Speaker 3>with his,</v>

5214
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:03.761
<v Speaker 3>with his left hand.</v>

5215
02:26:03.761 --> 02:26:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I could see that and I don't really see it with a lot of fighters.</v>

5216
02:26:06.851 --> 02:26:07.241
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

5217
02:26:07.241 --> 02:26:08.021
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit,</v>

5218
02:26:08.021 --> 02:26:08.950
<v Speaker 3>but is that,</v>

5219
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:09.330
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5220
02:26:09.330 --> 02:26:09.710
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

5221
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:11.590
<v Speaker 3>It like an amazing counterpart.</v>

5222
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:14.290
<v Speaker 3>100% of that because I'm seeing like your,</v>

5223
02:26:14.291 --> 02:26:15.400
<v Speaker 3>as soon as someone throws he goes,</v>

5224
02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:16.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5225
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like just waiting for such a hundred percent clean.</v>

5226
02:26:19.210 --> 02:26:20.860
<v Speaker 3>It's so obvious.</v>

5227
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:21.461
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

5228
02:26:21.461 --> 02:26:22.151
<v Speaker 3>it's waiting for you.</v>

5229
02:26:22.151 --> 02:26:22.841
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you throw,</v>

5230
02:26:22.841 --> 02:26:23.750
<v Speaker 3>he's going to fucking spots.</v>

5231
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:24.743
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

5232
02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Connor has this ability to slide back and counter with such incredible</v>

5233
02:26:30.791 --> 02:26:31.271
<v Speaker 3>precision.</v>

5234
02:26:31.271 --> 02:26:32.104
<v Speaker 3>He's just got it.</v>

5235
02:26:32.290 --> 02:26:33.123
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>

5236
02:26:33.390 --> 02:26:33.581
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

5237
02:26:33.581 --> 02:26:35.200
<v Speaker 3>don't you get a full precision to,</v>

5238
02:26:35.201 --> 02:26:35.981
<v Speaker 3>it's the techniques.</v>

5239
02:26:35.981 --> 02:26:36.551
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

5240
02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:37.890
<v Speaker 3>He plants it right on your chin.</v>

5241
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.100
<v Speaker 3>He's super accurate.</v>

5242
02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.180
<v Speaker 3>He's so fast.</v>

5243
02:26:40.181 --> 02:26:40.990
<v Speaker 3>You get surprised.</v>

5244
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.411
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

5245
02:26:41.411 --> 02:26:46.300
<v Speaker 3>You think his strength is to is he's had some sort of skill where he can</v>

5246
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:48.670
<v Speaker 3>predetermine what you're going to do.</v>

5247
02:26:48.850 --> 02:26:49.331
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5248
02:26:49.331 --> 02:26:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Like really seen it.</v>

5249
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:54.460
<v Speaker 3>We've never really seen a lot of understanding of striking and movement.</v>

5250
02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:55.031
<v Speaker 3>How do you get,</v>

5251
02:26:55.031 --> 02:26:56.160
<v Speaker 3>how do you get that good time?</v>

5252
02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:57.101
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>

5253
02:26:57.101 --> 02:26:57.521
<v Speaker 3>I want to be,</v>

5254
02:26:57.521 --> 02:26:58.750
<v Speaker 3>if a guy comes to you and says,</v>

5255
02:26:58.751 --> 02:26:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like what are you going to do?</v>

5292
02:27:45.341 --> 02:27:45.791
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

5293
02:27:45.791 --> 02:27:48.460
<v Speaker 3>if you took a guy who like almost no kicks whatsoever,</v>

5294
02:27:48.461 --> 02:27:48.731
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>

5295
02:27:48.731 --> 02:27:48.941
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5296
02:27:48.941 --> 02:27:49.181
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5297
02:27:49.181 --> 02:27:50.170
<v Speaker 3>let's forget the kicks,</v>

5298
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:51.970
<v Speaker 3>but I want you to do is just check kicks.</v>

5299
02:27:51.971 --> 02:27:53.200
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna work on punches.</v>

5300
02:27:53.201 --> 02:27:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Can you throw elbows?</v>

5301
02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you off balance throwing kicks you your,</v>

5302
02:27:56.351 --> 02:27:58.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different things you would think of,</v>

5303
02:27:58.031 --> 02:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>but when you see Connor's counters,</v>

5304
02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:01.630
<v Speaker 3>his counters are so precise.</v>

5305
02:28:01.631 --> 02:28:05.550
<v Speaker 3>You only get that through that 10,000 hour principle to work with someone yet</v>

5306
02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:09.520
<v Speaker 3>five years be obsessed and they ought to be genetically gifted because there's</v>

5307
02:28:09.521 --> 02:28:13.530
<v Speaker 3>certain punchers they just did not have that kind of snap to be counter guy.</v>

5308
02:28:13.531 --> 02:28:17.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like a guy like Matt Hamill who was a really powerful wrestler and a good</v>

5309
02:28:17.471 --> 02:28:19.120
<v Speaker 3>puncher and a good striker.</v>

5310
02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately later in his career,</v>

5311
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:21.591
<v Speaker 3>he never had that.</v>

5312
02:28:21.591 --> 02:28:23.090
<v Speaker 3>But there's that fucking,</v>

5313
02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:26.550
<v Speaker 3>there's that fucking Tammy some bad have you don't.</v>

5314
02:28:26.551 --> 02:28:27.384
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean?</v>

5315
02:28:27.730 --> 02:28:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Got Good example.</v>

5316
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:29.451
<v Speaker 3>Good example.</v>

5317
02:28:29.451 --> 02:28:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's a tough guy in a strong,</v>

5318
02:28:30.951 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 3>powerful resume.</v>

5319
02:28:31.821 --> 02:28:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Explosive.</v>

5320
02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

5321
02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:33.641
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

5322
02:28:33.641 --> 02:28:33.980
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5323
02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Kind of accuracy that there's a bunch of guys you could say that you could put</v>

5324
02:28:38.451 --> 02:28:42.230
<v Speaker 3>in that category who were like really powerful grapplers who just weren't the</v>

5325
02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.390
<v Speaker 3>most lightning like strikers.</v>

5326
02:28:44.391 --> 02:28:44.621
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

5327
02:28:44.621 --> 02:28:46.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain type of striking,</v>

5328
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.290
<v Speaker 3>there's striking where you know that the guy has good technique and you know</v>

5329
02:28:51.291 --> 02:28:56.060
<v Speaker 3>that the guy pretty much understands where to be and where not to be and when to</v>

5330
02:28:56.061 --> 02:28:56.730
<v Speaker 3>be defensive,</v>

5331
02:28:56.730 --> 02:28:57.800
<v Speaker 3>when to be offensive.</v>

5332
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:59.120
<v Speaker 3>That's like a well rounded Stryker.</v>

5333
02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.280
<v Speaker 3>And then there's guys like Roy Jones Jr.</v>

5334
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:03.930
<v Speaker 3>There's every now and then you have these tank creeks.</v>

5335
02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:09.080
<v Speaker 3>But Roy Jones Jr was a weird one because Roy Jones Jr abandoned all of the</v>

5336
02:29:09.081 --> 02:29:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Orthodoxy of boxing.</v>

5337
02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean he kept his hands low,</v>

5338
02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:14.510
<v Speaker 3>barely threw jabs.</v>

5339
02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:19.160
<v Speaker 3>He threw a leaping left hook instead and he had ridiculous speed and power to</v>

5340
02:29:19.161 --> 02:29:20.720
<v Speaker 3>the point where nobody can fuck with it.</v>

5341
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Met when he was in his prime.</v>

5342
02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5343
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Fuck he was so funny.</v>

5344
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch the Kovalev Andre Ward?</v>

5345
02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:29.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5346
02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Tight man.</v>

5347
02:29:29.790 --> 02:29:30.151
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

5348
02:29:30.151 --> 02:29:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I watched it again.</v>

5349
02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I watched it again and uh,</v>

5350
02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see if I was biased cause I thought the Kovalev won and I still</v>

5351
02:29:36.921 --> 02:29:37.510
<v Speaker 3>think you won.</v>

5352
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5353
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I said why I didn't think you won by one much.</v>

5354
02:29:39.831 --> 02:29:42.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think Andre Ward did a really good job of holding his own,</v>

5355
02:29:42.201 --> 02:29:47.201
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't think there was enough convincing rounds where ward one in the</v>

5356
02:29:47.331 --> 02:29:49.520
<v Speaker 3>way that I think the rounds that Kovalev won.</v>

5357
02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5358
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:51.080
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

5359
02:29:51.081 --> 02:29:51.830
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

5360
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:52.641
<v Speaker 3>I was watching my God,</v>

5361
02:29:52.641 --> 02:29:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I feel like Cola.</v>

5362
02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Definitely one.</v>

5363
02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:55.160
<v Speaker 3>But it was close.</v>

5364
02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:57.140
<v Speaker 3>And then when Letterman was like,</v>

5365
02:29:57.141 --> 02:29:57.231
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5366
02:29:57.231 --> 02:29:58.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a complete blowout.</v>

5367
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5368
02:29:58.341 --> 02:29:59.240
<v Speaker 3>well I don't agree with that.</v>

5369
02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:02.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'll j ward one but I don't think he got blown out.</v>

5370
02:30:02.810 --> 02:30:03.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5371
02:30:03.111 --> 02:30:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a one point for Kovalev and I think the reason why you can make</v>

5372
02:30:06.681 --> 02:30:09.890
<v Speaker 3>that is because I think that Andre Ward sorta clawed his way back.</v>

5373
02:30:09.891 --> 02:30:11.230
<v Speaker 3>You won some rounds like,</v>

5374
02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:14.750
<v Speaker 3>like later in the fight it seem like he had got that jab establish more and he</v>

5375
02:30:14.751 --> 02:30:16.020
<v Speaker 3>popped a couple of real good,</v>

5376
02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:18.020
<v Speaker 3>he was doing work but he got,</v>

5377
02:30:18.021 --> 02:30:18.530
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

5378
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:19.251
<v Speaker 3>he was a 10,</v>

5379
02:30:19.251 --> 02:30:20.670
<v Speaker 3>eight round I think in the second,</v>

5380
02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:21.973
<v Speaker 3>second round.</v>

5381
02:30:22.310 --> 02:30:23.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could,</v>

5382
02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:25.850
<v Speaker 3>you could see a one point round for cove,</v>

5383
02:30:25.851 --> 02:30:27.890
<v Speaker 3>a 1.5 for coke won the fight though.</v>

5384
02:30:28.220 --> 02:30:29.053
<v Speaker 3>But I just,</v>

5385
02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:30.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5386
02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

5387
02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:31.813
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

5388
02:30:32.410 --> 02:30:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Crazy land and bombs.</v>

5389
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:34.423
<v Speaker 3>Crazy fight.</v>

5390
02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:35.330
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

5391
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:38.000
<v Speaker 3>it depends entirely on how you score fights too,</v>

5392
02:30:38.001 --> 02:30:38.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5393
02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody has their own idea.</v>

5394
02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:40.650
<v Speaker 3>Kill him.</v>

5395
02:30:40.650 --> 02:30:40.941
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

5396
02:30:40.941 --> 02:30:42.380
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the numbers though,</v>

5397
02:30:42.410 --> 02:30:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Charlie's with numbers of like w significant punches favors Covello true,</v>

5398
02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:47.541
<v Speaker 3>but by,</v>

5399
02:30:47.541 --> 02:30:48.011
<v Speaker 3>by Joe,</v>

5400
02:30:48.011 --> 02:30:48.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5401
02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:49.410
<v Speaker 3>you're number one fighters.</v>

5402
02:30:49.430 --> 02:30:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Mighty mouse number two is Anderson Silva.</v>

5403
02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5404
02:30:51.980 --> 02:30:56.030
<v Speaker 3>that's my number one and number two because I judge him on what I see from him</v>

5405
02:30:56.031 --> 02:30:56.840
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

5406
02:30:56.840 --> 02:30:59.300
<v Speaker 3>And when I see like I understand that he's fighting smaller guys,</v>

5407
02:30:59.301 --> 02:31:00.770
<v Speaker 3>I understand they don't have as much power.</v>

5408
02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:03.680
<v Speaker 3>I understand that the margin of error is different.</v>

5409
02:31:03.681 --> 02:31:04.191
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

5410
02:31:04.191 --> 02:31:08.510
<v Speaker 3>what I factor in is the greatness of movement and what I see in mighty mouse is</v>

5411
02:31:08.511 --> 02:31:09.740
<v Speaker 3>so pure efficiency.</v>

5412
02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I see crazy shit like when he got so Hutto in the clinch and he's throwing these</v>

5413
02:31:14.061 --> 02:31:17.030
<v Speaker 3>precision knees to the body that come with no wind up.</v>

5414
02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:18.800
<v Speaker 3>So who has no idea they're coming.</v>

5415
02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Mighty mouse puts it on</v>

5416
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.370
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

5417
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the mighty mouse that saw Joseph Benevidez leaving his chin out there</v>

5418
02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:27.570
<v Speaker 1>and caught him with one punch and k owed him when the knock on him was that he</v>

5419
02:31:27.571 --> 02:31:29.130
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a one punch Stryker.</v>

5420
02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I saw him when he fought he,</v>

5421
02:31:30.891 --> 02:31:31.171
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

5422
02:31:31.171 --> 02:31:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Where he dominated.</v>

5423
02:31:32.221 --> 02:31:35.310
<v Speaker 1>He oakey for all five rounds and what a second to go.</v>

5424
02:31:35.370 --> 02:31:36.840
<v Speaker 1>She always catches him with an arm bar.</v>

5425
02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5426
02:31:36.970 --> 02:31:38.160
<v Speaker 1>You know who we don't include them.</v>

5427
02:31:38.161 --> 02:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Pound for pound is not active enough.</v>

5428
02:31:40.621 --> 02:31:41.454
<v Speaker 1>Dominick Cruz.</v>

5429
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:43.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at this record,</v>

5430
02:31:43.231 --> 02:31:44.240
<v Speaker 1>it's days.</v>

5431
02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:45.520
<v Speaker 1>He's great point,</v>

5432
02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:46.560
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't,</v>

5433
02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:48.240
<v Speaker 1>he's not looking at it as a great,</v>

5434
02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what man,</v>

5435
02:31:49.291 --> 02:31:50.011
<v Speaker 1>him and Cody,</v>

5436
02:31:50.011 --> 02:31:51.040
<v Speaker 1>no love is going to be</v>

5437
02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting because Cody taxes,</v>

5438
02:31:54.871 --> 02:31:55.890
<v Speaker 1>anyone that goes to sleep,</v>

5439
02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:56.850
<v Speaker 1>he's my friend.</v>

5440
02:31:56.850 --> 02:31:57.880
<v Speaker 1>He's my favorite fighter at wait,</v>

5441
02:31:57.930 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 1>go see this.</v>

5442
02:31:58.710 --> 02:32:01.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good point because what we're talking about is about like guys who</v>

5443
02:32:01.771 --> 02:32:03.900
<v Speaker 1>are really good at certain things like Cody,</v>

5444
02:32:03.901 --> 02:32:06.150
<v Speaker 1>no love is way better at striking the,</v>

5445
02:32:06.151 --> 02:32:08.250
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing right now is way better.</v>

5446
02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:10.080
<v Speaker 1>He's the chocolate Delta class.</v>

5447
02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:12.540
<v Speaker 1>He does creepy,</v>

5448
02:32:12.541 --> 02:32:14.160
<v Speaker 1>scary shit to people.</v>

5449
02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Like when he merch Thomas Almeda with that combination hike,</v>

5450
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:17.851
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5451
02:32:17.851 --> 02:32:20.280
<v Speaker 1>his stacking is like these guys make no mistake about it.</v>

5452
02:32:20.281 --> 02:32:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Benevidez and so who does he always,</v>

5453
02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:22.560
<v Speaker 1>trainers.</v>

5454
02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Joyce winning.</v>

5455
02:32:23.310 --> 02:32:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure you're writing at all.</v>

5456
02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And I bet on,</v>

5457
02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:27.433
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

5458
02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You not catching man.</v>

5459
02:32:28.621 --> 02:32:30.390
<v Speaker 1>They do this every time it's been watching it.</v>

5460
02:32:30.391 --> 02:32:31.224
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking.</v>

5461
02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:33.300
<v Speaker 1>The thing is though is with,</v>

5462
02:32:33.301 --> 02:32:33.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5463
02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:35.310
<v Speaker 1>with Dominick Cruz and Garbin.</v>

5464
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Dominick Cruz isn't a knockout artist.</v>

5465
02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:38.160
<v Speaker 1>He's far from it.</v>

5466
02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:40.410
<v Speaker 1>So he might win 30 punches.</v>

5467
02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Garburate needs one in 25,</v>

5468
02:32:43.321 --> 02:32:46.200
<v Speaker 1>but we've never seen God Brant four and five rounds in.</v>

5469
02:32:46.201 --> 02:32:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

5470
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting because he's a very explosive,</v>

5471
02:32:48.271 --> 02:32:49.320
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fun fight though,</v>

5472
02:32:49.350 --> 02:32:53.420
<v Speaker 1>but he's never been a guy that shows any sort of a slow down in his style get</v>

5473
02:32:53.470 --> 02:32:53.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5474
02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Some people are upset that he got it.</v>

5475
02:32:54.901 --> 02:32:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

5476
02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:55.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

5477
02:32:55.861 --> 02:32:56.694
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

5478
02:32:56.730 --> 02:32:57.090
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>

5479
02:32:57.090 --> 02:32:58.560
<v Speaker 1>but personally I feel bad for it.</v>

5480
02:32:58.561 --> 02:32:58.711

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5489
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:10.000
<v Speaker 1>He's got so creepy power in his hands.</v>

5490
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:12.240
<v Speaker 1>The motherfucking yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He said terrifying powerhouse.</v>

5498
02:33:18.881 --> 02:33:23.370
<v Speaker 1>See I thought John Dotson beat him really cause lot Linacre was gonna come and</v>

5499
02:33:23.371 --> 02:33:24.840
<v Speaker 1>forward nonstop at Dotson.</v>

5500
02:33:24.841 --> 02:33:25.674
<v Speaker 1>When that fight,</v>

5501
02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go back and watch it again.</v>

5502
02:33:27.090 --> 02:33:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing the decision thinking it was correct.</v>

5503
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go back and watch that again.</v>

5509
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:42.100
<v Speaker 1>That's where it looked like to me.</v>

02:39:49.490 --> 02:39:50.323
<v Speaker 5>Burritos,</v>

5718

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5719
02:39:52.431 --> 02:39:55.130
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with a shelf arrival when I was a kid.</v>

5720
02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:55.940
<v Speaker 5>It really was.</v>

5721
02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:58.460
<v Speaker 5>When I left my parents' house of Raman.</v>

5722
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:59.690
<v Speaker 5>Raman was big,</v>

5723
02:39:59.691 --> 02:40:00.261
<v Speaker 5>what age?</v>

5724
02:40:00.261 --> 02:40:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Two top ramen.</v>

5725
02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:04.630
<v Speaker 5>But I was real pro at my brokest.</v>

5726
02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:07.960
<v Speaker 5>I was like 1920 was my brokest like those college.</v>

5727
02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:08.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5728
02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:10.970
<v Speaker 5>well I was going to college,</v>

5729
02:40:10.971 --> 02:40:12.100
<v Speaker 5>but it was when I,</v>

5730
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:13.500
<v Speaker 5>even when I say I'm going to college,</v>

5731
02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 5>they should be</v>

5732
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:15.750
<v Speaker 1>like an asterisk next to that statement,</v>

5733
02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

5734
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I was taking classes,</v>

5735
02:40:17.371 --> 02:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't even ever thinking I was getting to get a job.</v>

5736
02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want anybody thinking I was a loser and I'd run into people in my</v>

5737
02:40:22.951 --> 02:40:23.311
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

5738
02:40:23.311 --> 02:40:23.611
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

5739
02:40:23.611 --> 02:40:24.031
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

5740
02:40:24.031 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5741
02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5742
02:40:24.361 --> 02:40:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking a year off.</v>

5743
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.471
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

5744
02:40:25.471 --> 02:40:25.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5745
02:40:25.651 --> 02:40:26.484
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking loser.</v>

5746
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:27.480
<v Speaker 1>So after a year I'm like,</v>

5747
02:40:27.481 --> 02:40:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep feeling that every time I talked to somebody,</v>

5748
02:40:29.701 --> 02:40:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to school.</v>

5749
02:40:31.230 --> 02:40:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So I started going to college,</v>

5750
02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:35.250
<v Speaker 1>but it was barely paying attention and it was just,</v>

5751
02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I was paying more attention to like,</v>

5752
02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:40.770
<v Speaker 1>because that was at the time that I was considering doing standup comedy.</v>

5753
02:40:40.771 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't done it yet.</v>

5754
02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Like and when I started doing it,</v>

5755
02:40:43.321 --> 02:40:44.160
<v Speaker 1>that's when I quit college,</v>

5756
02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but I was considering doing it so it was really more paying attention to people</v>

5757
02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.240
<v Speaker 1>and how weird we all are in this struggle between being child and being an adult</v>

5758
02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:56.490
<v Speaker 1>is this weird transitionary period where people are feeling their oats and</v>

5759
02:40:56.491 --> 02:41:00.900
<v Speaker 1>flexing their intellectual muscles in front of a teacher and trying to catch the</v>

5760
02:41:00.901 --> 02:41:04.050
<v Speaker 1>teacher what's wrong and trying to debate the teacher.</v>

5761
02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I was fascinated by that man.</v>

5762
02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I was fascinated by that because I was,</v>

5763
02:41:07.890 --> 02:41:10.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting especially that was all when I was still competing.</v>

5764
02:41:10.770 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I was always really,</v>

5765
02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:14.370
<v Speaker 1>really interested in conflict.</v>

5766
02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Any kind of conflict,</v>

5767
02:41:15.511 --> 02:41:16.440
<v Speaker 1>verbal conflicts,</v>

5768
02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:18.840
<v Speaker 1>physical conflict games and braced it.</v>

5769
02:41:18.841 --> 02:41:20.370
<v Speaker 1>You're saying I'm interested in it.</v>

5770
02:41:20.371 --> 02:41:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious as to what's going on here,</v>

5771
02:41:22.321 --> 02:41:25.470
<v Speaker 1>like why is this kid protesting what the teacher's saying?</v>

5772
02:41:25.471 --> 02:41:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Is he protesting because he's made a really solid assessment of the facts at</v>

5773
02:41:29.521 --> 02:41:29.821
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

5774
02:41:29.821 --> 02:41:33.030
<v Speaker 1>He finds a flaw in the logic or as you trying to get attention,</v>

5775
02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 1>has he looked at it from,</v>

5776
02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:38.730
<v Speaker 1>if he's has step one through 10 to really verify what your thoughts are really.</v>

5777
02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you looked at one through 10 or did you go up to like three and you feel</v>

5778
02:41:43.021 --> 02:41:45.210
<v Speaker 1>your oats and you think you're smart as fuck and you dive in?</v>

5779
02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

5780
02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:48.300
<v Speaker 1>when I was more interested in when I was in college,</v>

5781
02:41:48.330 --> 02:41:50.760
<v Speaker 1>honestly it was just people interacting with each other.</v>

5782
02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:55.320
<v Speaker 1>My favorite moment from college had to do with his Puerto Rican girl that I was</v>

5783
02:41:55.321 --> 02:41:56.010
<v Speaker 1>trying to fuck.</v>

5784
02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:56.401
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

5785
02:41:56.401 --> 02:41:57.091
<v Speaker 1>And I was in the,</v>

5786
02:41:57.091 --> 02:41:57.924
<v Speaker 1>I was in the,</v>

5787
02:41:57.940 --> 02:41:58.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5788
02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>that was in the lunch room with this girl.</v>

5789
02:42:00.271 --> 02:42:04.050
<v Speaker 1>This girl kept inviting me to go to these things with her.</v>

5790
02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:04.290
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

5791
02:42:04.290 --> 02:42:05.280
<v Speaker 1>She was like these,</v>

5792
02:42:05.281 --> 02:42:05.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5793
02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:05.940
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

5794
02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:07.380
<v Speaker 1>these fucking retreats.</v>

5795
02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:08.700
<v Speaker 1>She's like me and my friends.</v>

5796
02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:11.760
<v Speaker 1>She was in my Italian trying to fuck some dude.</v>

5797
02:42:11.761 --> 02:42:12.640
<v Speaker 1>She was so hot.</v>

5798
02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I know that name.</v>

5799
02:42:13.530 --> 02:42:17.040
<v Speaker 1>She was so hot to conclude she was the inclusion.</v>

5800
02:42:17.250 --> 02:42:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Let me please tell me.</v>

5801
02:42:18.030 --> 02:42:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell the story.</v>

5802
02:42:18.810 --> 02:42:22.350
<v Speaker 1>She was thick and she was juicy and she had glasses and I knew she spoke</v>

5803
02:42:22.351 --> 02:42:22.801
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

5804
02:42:22.801 --> 02:42:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't wait to hear it.</v>

5805
02:42:23.970 --> 02:42:24.421
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

5806
02:42:24.421 --> 02:42:27.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time as this girl's giving me all kinds of vibe.</v>

5807
02:42:27.961 --> 02:42:28.131
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5808
02:42:28.131 --> 02:42:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I can our walls down.</v>

5809
02:42:28.890 --> 02:42:29.281
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

5810
02:42:29.281 --> 02:42:30.114
<v Speaker 1>got to break the walls down.</v>

5811
02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:31.230
<v Speaker 1>We're going down in the Cape.</v>

5812
02:42:31.410 --> 02:42:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I would love if you'd come,</v>

5813
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:34.110
<v Speaker 1>and I felt bad.</v>

5814
02:42:34.350 --> 02:42:34.771
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want,</v>

5815
02:42:34.771 --> 02:42:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to tell her that it was going to fight in a tournament.</v>

5816
02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:38.153
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

5817
02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:38.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5818
02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:38.731
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5819
02:42:38.731 --> 02:42:38.821
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5820
02:42:38.821 --> 02:42:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I was just super insecure about it.</v>

5821
02:42:40.291 --> 02:42:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was an idiot.</v>

5822
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had brain damage was in college.</v>

5823
02:42:43.641 --> 02:42:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I was Jack you off in history now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5828
02:42:49.350 --> 02:42:51.330
<v Speaker 1>it didn't sound even real to say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So then I went back to school after the tournament.</v>

5859
02:43:16.151 --> 02:43:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting in the lunch room and ironically enough,</v>

5860
02:43:18.850 --> 02:43:20.470
<v Speaker 1>it was a Trump airplane.</v>

5861
02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those Trump airlines.</v>

5862
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:23.351
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

5863
02:43:23.351 --> 02:43:24.101
<v Speaker 1>Eric Trump.</v>

5864
02:43:24.101 --> 02:43:24.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5865
02:43:24.311 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>

5866
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I was at the lunch room and we were about to eat and the Trump airline that day,</v>

5867
02:43:29.411 --> 02:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>the fucking landing gear didn't come down,</v>

5868
02:43:32.020 --> 02:43:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but the Jed skid,</v>

5869
02:43:33.551 --> 02:43:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the jet skid into the runway and sparks and they put fucking flame retardant</v>

5870
02:43:38.081 --> 02:43:39.220
<v Speaker 1>foam over the runway.</v>

5871
02:43:39.221 --> 02:43:40.054
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

5872
02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I went down,</v>

5873
02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I sat down with these kids was this Puerto Rican girl was so hot and all of her</v>

5874
02:43:45.311 --> 02:43:45.850
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

5875
02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and I sat down with them at lunch and I said,</v>

5876
02:43:47.591 --> 02:43:50.110
<v Speaker 1>did you guys hear about the jet that a,</v>

5877
02:43:50.111 --> 02:43:51.550
<v Speaker 1>that just crashed landed?</v>

5878
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:52.960
<v Speaker 1>It had this run and they were like,</v>

5879
02:43:52.961 --> 02:43:53.794
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

5880
02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:54.131
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

5881
02:43:54.131 --> 02:43:57.700
<v Speaker 1>apparently the front landing gear didn't engage,</v>

5882
02:43:57.701 --> 02:43:59.440
<v Speaker 1>didn't lock down Trump airlines,</v>

5883
02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's fine.</v>

5884
02:44:01.151 --> 02:44:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And everybody,</v>

5885
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:02.500
<v Speaker 1>nobody got hurt.</v>

5886
02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:02.950
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

5887
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:03.251

5891
02:44:06.011 --> 02:44:06.670

5892
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:07.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

5893
02:44:08.770 --> 02:44:11.950
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized I was standing there over the table cause they're all going,</v>

5894
02:44:11.951 --> 02:44:12.910

5898
02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I sat down</v>

5899
02:44:20.810 --> 02:44:25.150
<v Speaker 1>with so much sadness but also happy because I love conflict,</v>

5900
02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:25.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5901

02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like this little demon.</v>

5903
02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:29.310

02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:38.733
<v Speaker 1>Keep calling.</v>

5910
02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.330
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even know me then.</v>

5911
02:44:40.331 --> 02:44:41.440
<v Speaker 1>This is when I was 19</v>

5912
02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I was 19 I was straight feral home.</v>

5913
02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I sat down at this table,</v>

5914
02:44:47.490 --> 02:44:50.080
<v Speaker 1>they're going like praise God wild.</v>

5915
02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:55.210
<v Speaker 1>My mother is a beautiful person and my Stepdad's a beautiful man.</v>

5916
02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I love them to death.</v>

5917
02:44:56.231 --> 02:44:58.690
<v Speaker 1>But they worked and when people work,</v>

5918
02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:03.280
<v Speaker 1>the kids are gone from whatever time to whatever they get out of school.</v>

5919
02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

5920
02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Fucking wild.</v>

5921
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Wild in the streets.</v>

5922
02:45:06.671 --> 02:45:11.671
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I grew up as was a latchkey kid from a divorced family and I grew</v>

5923
02:45:12.071 --> 02:45:15.700
<v Speaker 1>up hanging out with other kids and you develop these crazy and then I started</v>

5924
02:45:15.701 --> 02:45:16.031
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

5925
02:45:16.031 --> 02:45:18.220
<v Speaker 1>So no juicy Puerto Rican ass for you.</v>

5926
02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:22.120
<v Speaker 1>So I was fighting so I had a very distorted version of things as it is.</v>

5927
02:45:22.350 --> 02:45:24.490
<v Speaker 1>So then I sat down and I said,</v>

5928
02:45:24.491 --> 02:45:29.491
<v Speaker 1>so this thing that you wanted me to do when you were asking me to go hang out</v>

5929
02:45:29.531 --> 02:45:33.280
<v Speaker 1>with your friends and the Cape and have like a big smile on my face,</v>

5930
02:45:33.281 --> 02:45:33.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5931
02:45:33.641 --> 02:45:35.080

5932
02:45:35.081 --> 02:45:35.914
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5933
02:45:36.130 --> 02:45:36.671
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

5934
02:45:36.671 --> 02:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it's really important that you know Jesus.</v>

5950
02:45:50.470 --> 02:45:52.510

02:45:53.020 --> 02:45:54.040
<v Speaker 1>which Bible we're talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but as far as like overall MMA coaches,</v>

6002
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.421
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6003
02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:13.300
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to not give the nod to Matt.</v>

6004
02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

6005
02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:15.110
<v Speaker 1>you more for us are my number one.</v>

6006
02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:16.040
<v Speaker 1>They're number one.</v>

6007
02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:16.550
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

6008
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:19.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like the pound for pound tongue and can really rotate them out and got like</v>

6009
02:47:19.970 --> 02:47:20.570
<v Speaker 1>GSP.</v>

6010
02:47:20.570 --> 02:47:21.403
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he,</v>

6011
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:24.680
<v Speaker 1>he developed under the tutelage of for us a hobby,</v>

6012
02:47:24.681 --> 02:47:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but he would have developed under the tutelage of Matt Hume to maybe,</v>

6013
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:28.911
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

6014
02:47:28.911 --> 02:47:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I think you would have,</v>

6015
02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:31.040
<v Speaker 1>if he could learn French</v>

6016
02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:33.411
<v Speaker 1>for Austin.</v>

6017
02:47:33.411 --> 02:47:34.320
<v Speaker 1>GSP were boys,</v>

6018
02:47:34.321 --> 02:47:38.330
<v Speaker 1>so they get his bond and connection is a big fighting for each other.</v>

6019
02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're Tim Elliot,</v>

6020
02:47:39.771 --> 02:47:41.300
<v Speaker 1>it's guns bombs away,</v>

6021
02:47:41.301 --> 02:47:42.134
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6022
02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:43.521
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

6023
02:47:43.521 --> 02:47:44.241
<v Speaker 1>It's bombs away.</v>

6024
02:47:44.241 --> 02:47:45.200
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go bombs away.</v>

6025
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:46.850
<v Speaker 1>You think you just got to go balls to the wall.</v>

6026
02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:47.933
<v Speaker 1>What's in style?</v>

6027
02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6028
02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:49.131
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

6029
02:47:49.131 --> 02:47:49.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6030
02:47:49.371 --> 02:47:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean almost like the only way you didn't get to how technique.</v>

6031
02:47:52.431 --> 02:47:52.881
<v Speaker 1>This guy.</v>

6032
02:47:52.881 --> 02:47:53.550
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

6033
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:57.010
<v Speaker 1>who did it well and do the high level guy though.</v>

6034
02:47:57.020 --> 02:47:57.561
<v Speaker 1>It's lost.</v>

6035
02:47:57.561 --> 02:48:00.150
<v Speaker 1>It is like Geo beaten coming.</v>

6036
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:00.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6037
02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:01.221
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>

6038
02:48:01.221 --> 02:48:01.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6039
02:48:01.431 --> 02:48:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

6040
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Most people thought Cummings was an,</v>

6041
02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you know and rightfully so.</v>

6042
02:48:06.651 --> 02:48:08.420
<v Speaker 1>He's mulling through everybody with this heel hook.</v>

6043
02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:08.931
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

6044
02:48:08.931 --> 02:48:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Geo hang with that and he did her Daniel Exporters.</v>

6045
02:48:12.350 --> 02:48:15.830
<v Speaker 1>MMA is like Wednesday on the Mickey Mouse Club.</v>

02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Not at this weight class.</v>

6053
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Disagree with that.</v>

6054
02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:27.253
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

6055
02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:28.873
<v Speaker 1>Disagree.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Explain that.</v>

6060
02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.350
<v Speaker 1>He'd just said anything good happening inside disagreed because of the ways the</v>

6061
02:48:42.351 --> 02:48:42.980
<v Speaker 1>weight class.</v>

6062
02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:47.980
<v Speaker 1>What can't happen because of the weight guys can get k cause they're so wise</v>

6063
02:48:49.221 --> 02:48:51.060
<v Speaker 1>we'll get Kayo they do get care at all.</v>

6064
02:48:51.170 --> 02:48:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Like not maybe as often odds,</v>

6065
02:48:55.850 --> 02:49:00.350
<v Speaker 1>odds of statistics sizeist anything but anything can happen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It can happen and I want butter.</v>

<v Speaker 5>out can happen.</v>

6069
02:49:09.630 --> 02:49:10.463
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

6070
02:49:12.210 --> 02:49:16.050
<v Speaker 5>the opposite end of the spectrum is the cad decision can happen.</v>

6071
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:17.131
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

6072
02:49:17.131 --> 02:49:17.964
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

6073
02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:19.953
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

6074
02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:25.950
<v Speaker 5>can I just stop this before this fight and say this is my favorite thing to do</v>

6075
02:49:25.951 --> 02:49:26.784
<v Speaker 5>and my whole life,</v>

6076
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:30.570
<v Speaker 5>the best thing in up this morning,</v>

6077
02:49:31.170 --> 02:49:32.370
<v Speaker 5>I woke up this morning,</v>

6078
02:49:32.371 --> 02:49:33.950
<v Speaker 5>crunk is fucked about it.</v>

6079
02:49:40.030 --> 02:49:40.831
<v Speaker 5>So stupid.</v>

02:49:40.831 --> 02:49:41.840
<v Speaker 5>Fuck I fucking love.</v>

6081
02:49:41.841 --> 02:49:43.860
<v Speaker 5>We must watch this because he's ready.</v>

6082
02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:44.940
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

6083
02:49:44.941 --> 02:49:46.300
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing I'm saying I'm,</v>

6084
02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:47.850
<v Speaker 5>I've been singing this dude's praises forever.</v>

6085
02:49:47.851 --> 02:49:48.071
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

6086
02:49:48.071 --> 02:49:49.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't think mighty mouse gets enough respect.</v>

6087
02:49:50.490 --> 02:49:53.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he gets the respect that he deserves that first phase of he's,</v>

6088
02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:54.650
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

6089
02:49:54.650 --> 02:49:55.411
<v Speaker 5>he said your name,</v>

6090
02:49:55.411 --> 02:49:55.621
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6091
02:49:55.621 --> 02:49:56.460
<v Speaker 5>So you say his name.</v>

6092
02:49:56.461 --> 02:49:57.181
<v Speaker 5>I love mighty mouse.</v>

6093
02:49:57.181 --> 02:49:57.870
<v Speaker 5>He's going to put,</v>

6094
02:49:57.870 --> 02:49:58.531
<v Speaker 5>this is what I think.</v>

6095
02:49:58.531 --> 02:50:00.870
<v Speaker 5>Forget about all the weight and all that stuff that you write.</v>

6096
02:50:00.871 --> 02:50:01.980
<v Speaker 5>You make some really good points.</v>

6097
02:50:02.010 --> 02:50:05.040
<v Speaker 5>But as far as an expression of martial arts talent,</v>

6098
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:07.260
<v Speaker 5>that's the finest I've ever seen in my life.</v>

6099
02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:11.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what he ways as far as expression of martial arts talent,</v>

6100
02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:12.270
<v Speaker 5>that's the finest I've ever seen.</v>

6101
02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:14.730
<v Speaker 5>So if Tim Elliot can beat him,</v>

6102
02:50:14.731 --> 02:50:18.100
<v Speaker 5>which he absolutely can because it's Wednesday and Wednesdays,</v>

6103
02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:18.960
<v Speaker 5>anything can happen.</v>

02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:34.640
<v Speaker 5>the speaking side rocks.</v>

6292
02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:34.941
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

6293
02:55:34.941 --> 02:55:38.450
<v Speaker 5>But Vito Belfort did catch him in an arm bar fully extended.</v>

6294
02:55:38.451 --> 02:55:38.780
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

6295
02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:40.910
<v Speaker 5>oh cool dude.</v>

6296
02:55:41.270 --> 02:55:42.230
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing he didn't do.</v>

6297
02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:42.830
<v Speaker 5>He didn't have,</v>

6298
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:44.090
<v Speaker 5>which was fucking substantial.</v>

6299
02:55:46.050 --> 02:55:46.883
<v Speaker 5>Second on your list,</v>

6300
02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:48.020
<v Speaker 5>I know you like John Jones.</v>

6301
02:55:48.021 --> 02:55:48.854

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:51.230
<v Speaker 5>Second is Connor mighty mouse.</v>

6304
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:54.830
<v Speaker 5>Mighty mouse is probably like five for makers weight class.</v>

6305
02:55:55.220 --> 02:56:00.220
<v Speaker 5>He rose on your shit fro seven or eight last time we did never seven or duty</v>

6306
02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:05.400
<v Speaker 5>froze like a motherfucker fucker.</v>

6307
02:56:05.890 --> 02:56:06.380
<v Speaker 5>Hell yeah.</v>

6308
02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:08.240
<v Speaker 5>What those fucking counter labs.</v>

6309
02:56:08.270 --> 02:56:12.740
<v Speaker 5>Here's what I think about 10 pound for pound bricks weighs just like,</v>

6310
02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:14.460
<v Speaker 5>it's just like he's just waiting for him.</v>

6311
02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:16.040
<v Speaker 5>Who's going to take that shit?</v>

6312
02:56:16.041 --> 02:56:16.521
<v Speaker 5>He let me,</v>

6313
02:56:16.521 --> 02:56:18.020
<v Speaker 5>let me ask you if you guys agree with me.</v>

6314
02:56:18.021 --> 02:56:21.710
<v Speaker 5>This is how I feel about when you start talking about top 10 pound for pound.</v>

6315
02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:24.140
<v Speaker 5>My feeling is that it's a fun debate.</v>

6316
02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:24.591
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

6317
02:56:24.591 --> 02:56:28.760
<v Speaker 5>I let the reality is you don't really know whether it's number one or number two</v>

6318
02:56:28.761 --> 02:56:31.980
<v Speaker 5>or number three cause there's an argument to the gross cyborg.</v>

6319
02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:33.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6320
02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:34.580
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>

6321
02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:35.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6322
02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6323
02:56:35.290 --> 02:56:39.050
<v Speaker 5>It's [inaudible] look at their stuff,</v>

6324
02:56:39.051 --> 02:56:40.270
<v Speaker 5>but you got to look at longevity.</v>

6325
02:56:40.271 --> 02:56:41.800
<v Speaker 5>You're looking at somebody who's beat up,</v>

6326
02:56:42.190 --> 02:56:45.920
<v Speaker 5>beat up silver did this man look at this.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he has dominated in several moments of that ranch.</v>

6334
02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:57.500
<v Speaker 5>He was doing it in the first round of jail before he was really,</v>

6335
02:56:57.700 --> 02:56:59.240

02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:51.930
<v Speaker 5>You never know man.</v>

6366
02:57:51.931 --> 02:57:53.280
<v Speaker 5>He's his elbow.</v>

6367
02:57:53.281 --> 02:57:55.440
<v Speaker 5>You look at where his bicep is and the ear,</v>

6368
02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:56.760
<v Speaker 5>it's not going up.</v>

6369

<v Speaker 5>It's going down.</v>

6370
02:57:57.720 --> 02:57:58.553
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

6376
02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:07.730
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter because he's on the opposite side.</v>

6377
02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:08.873
<v Speaker 4>He's in the wrong side,</v>

6378
02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:12.330
<v Speaker 4>but if a guy's really good at that empty half of physicians</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a chopping block.</v>

6388
02:58:38.940 --> 02:58:40.020
<v Speaker 4>That's a chopping block,</v>

6389
02:58:40.021 --> 02:58:40.854

6392
02:58:42.721 --> 02:58:43.770
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move right there.</v>

6393
02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:46.353
<v Speaker 4>Good</v>

6394
02:58:47.500 --> 02:58:48.670
<v Speaker 4>traps it position.</v>

6395
02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:53.610
<v Speaker 4>It keeps him from getting in that crucifix fucking striking crucifixions</v>

6396
02:58:55.320 --> 02:58:57.930
<v Speaker 4>because he needs his arm on the other side of the forearm.</v>

02:58:57.931 --> 02:59:00.990
<v Speaker 4>The smashed him down with those and now let's see if he can pat.</v>

6402
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:10.650
<v Speaker 4>That salivary shit.</v>

6403
02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:14.250
<v Speaker 4>You can't put your arm on the other side because you're going to get fucked on</v>

6404
02:59:14.251 --> 02:59:15.390

6416
02:59:36.061 --> 02:59:37.800
<v Speaker 4>it's about the wars.</v>

02:59:37.801 --> 02:59:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Elliot beach.</v>

6418
02:59:38.610 --> 02:59:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Every champion in every weight class in his division,</v>

6419
02:59:40.921 --> 02:59:45.090
<v Speaker 4>it makes you a path of wars before the submission even comes up.</v>

6420
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:49.340
<v Speaker 4>Not every so many wars go.</v>

6421
02:59:49.360 --> 02:59:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a crucifix.</v>

6424
02:59:53.730 --> 02:59:54.630
<v Speaker 4>It's going to get out of that.</v>

6425
02:59:55.560 --> 02:59:56.860
<v Speaker 4>But his left arms fuck.</v>

6426
02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.460
<v Speaker 4>He needs to get his left hand on the other side of his head right there.</v>

6427
02:59:59.730 --> 03:00:00.361
<v Speaker 4>Once he's there,</v>

6428
03:00:00.361 --> 03:00:00.751
<v Speaker 4>he's good.</v>

6429
03:00:00.751 --> 03:00:02.430
<v Speaker 4>He's getting easy to keep it over there,</v>

6430
03:00:02.610 --> 03:00:04.320
<v Speaker 4>but not that much over there.</v>

03:00:08.770 --> 03:00:10.620
<v Speaker 4>he's going to go for the neck.</v>

6434
03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:13.830
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to turn her down bar from the half guard.</v>

6435
03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:16.921
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

6436
03:00:16.921 --> 03:00:18.080
<v Speaker 4>He's got a good camera.</v>

6437
03:00:18.350 --> 03:00:19.183
<v Speaker 4>It's a killer man.</v>

6438
03:00:19.630 --> 03:00:20.041
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

6439
03:00:20.041 --> 03:00:20.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6440
03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:22.350
<v Speaker 4>that's one movie you really can get from the half card,</v>

6441
03:00:22.351 --> 03:00:22.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6442
03:00:22.910 --> 03:00:26.670
<v Speaker 4>I remember Matt Hughes Versus Joe Rigs.</v>

6443
03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:28.710
<v Speaker 4>It all depends on which camera you want.</v>

6444
03:00:28.711 --> 03:00:30.060
<v Speaker 4>If you want an inverted Kamora,</v>

6445
03:00:30.061 --> 03:00:31.860
<v Speaker 4>you have to be in an half guard.</v>

6446
03:00:31.950 --> 03:00:33.200
<v Speaker 4>If you want the regular Kamora,</v>

6447
03:00:33.201 --> 03:00:34.740
<v Speaker 4>you could pass me inside control,</v>

6448
03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:36.840
<v Speaker 4>but if you're going to do that inverted one,</v>

6449
03:00:37.170 --> 03:00:38.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it from side control.</v>

6450
03:00:38.551 --> 03:00:39.820
<v Speaker 4>You have to jump into half.</v>

6451
03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:45.390
<v Speaker 4>You have to hold him.</v>

6452
03:00:45.450 --> 03:00:46.050
<v Speaker 4>You hold,</v>

6453
03:00:46.050 --> 03:00:47.460
<v Speaker 4>you're holding him in half cock.</v>

6454
03:00:47.730 --> 03:00:48.570
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting.</v>

6455
03:00:48.930 --> 03:00:50.190
<v Speaker 4>First Time I've ever thought about that.</v>

6456
03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:52.950
<v Speaker 4>No more challenge.</v>

6457
03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:54.680
<v Speaker 4>Japanese act the same thing.</v>

6458
03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Japanese neck dial in the exact same thing.</v>

6459
03:00:57.630 --> 03:00:58.920
<v Speaker 4>You want to stay there,</v>

6460
03:00:59.000 --> 03:00:59.261
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6461
03:00:59.261 --> 03:00:59.740
<v Speaker 4>You need to lose.</v>

6462
03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:00.190
<v Speaker 4>It locks</v>

6464
03:01:00.551 --> 03:01:01.020

03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:03.400
<v Speaker 5>Mayer and the inverted arm bar.</v>

6467
03:01:03.430 --> 03:01:04.540
<v Speaker 5>It's all about the angle.</v>

6468
03:01:04.541 --> 03:01:05.200
<v Speaker 5>So you know what?</v>

6469
03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:06.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to pass after all,</v>

6470
03:01:06.791 --> 03:01:07.241
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

6471
03:01:07.241 --> 03:01:10.540
<v Speaker 5>We're going to stay in Africa and I don't even want to band and even if I was</v>

6472

6473
03:01:11.100 --> 03:01:13.620
<v Speaker 5>if I went for the inverted bard inverted arm bar,</v>

6474
03:01:13.630 --> 03:01:16.180
<v Speaker 5>I would jump in a health card just to control the hips.</v>

6475
03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:17.801
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6476
03:01:17.801 --> 03:01:18.670
<v Speaker 5>he's not taking his back.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're sparring and Brown three.</v>

6589
03:04:42.741 --> 03:04:43.574
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

6596
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:55.220
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say swim sprint.</v>

6597
03:04:55.221 --> 03:04:56.160
<v Speaker 5>I said regular sprints.</v>

6598
03:04:56.161 --> 03:04:56.700
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what I'm saying.</v>

6599
03:04:56.700 --> 03:04:57.830
<v Speaker 5>It's racism.</v>

6600
03:04:57.831 --> 03:04:58.520
<v Speaker 5>Work on Elliot.</v>

6601

<v Speaker 5>Look.</v>

6602

03:04:58.971 --> 03:04:59.804
<v Speaker 5>but look at this.</v>

6604
03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:00.890
<v Speaker 5>Dimitri is on top.</v>

6605
03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:05.260
<v Speaker 5>He's got that right arm trapped looking for that head out,</v>

6606
03:05:05.370 --> 03:05:06.920
<v Speaker 5>but not so not totally</v>

6607
03:05:08.520 --> 03:05:11.210
<v Speaker 5>capture fueled on math.</v>

6608
03:05:11.211 --> 03:05:11.391
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6609
03:05:11.391 --> 03:05:12.224
<v Speaker 5>really pat,</v>

6610
03:05:12.380 --> 03:05:13.213
<v Speaker 5>because he's white,</v>

6611
03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:15.490
<v Speaker 5>white trash people.</v>

6612
03:05:15.490 --> 03:05:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Stats are off trucks.</v>

6613
03:05:18.140 --> 03:05:18.973
<v Speaker 5>The stereotype.</v>

6614
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:20.930
<v Speaker 5>White people get in the guard spouse.</v>

6615
03:05:20.931 --> 03:05:24.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm sick of it and I'm going to fucking stand up and right here on the Joe Rogan</v>

6616
03:05:24.951 --> 03:05:25.784

<v Speaker 5>People get shots.</v>

6623
03:05:34.050 --> 03:05:36.260
<v Speaker 5>What about that black people get past.</v>

6624
03:05:36.261 --> 03:05:37.370
<v Speaker 5>What about that political.</v>

6625
03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:38.650
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like either one of those cans,</v>

03:05:52.971 --> 03:05:53.804
<v Speaker 5>I was playing.</v>

6636
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.823

6637
03:05:54.860 --> 03:05:55.760
<v Speaker 5>I was playing.</v>

6638
03:05:55.761 --> 03:05:59.150
<v Speaker 5>I was playing squash to fight mighty mouse on top of your folks.</v>

6640
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:02.420
<v Speaker 5>Mighty mouse will get past that guard.</v>

6641

6652
03:06:16.580 --> 03:06:18.350
<v Speaker 5>Rolls right back into half guard again.</v>

03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:43.760
<v Speaker 5>mighty mouse for a second truck.</v>

03:07:19.140 --> 03:07:20.490
<v Speaker 5>That grease on the ball head.</v>

6691
03:07:20.491 --> 03:07:24.120
<v Speaker 5>Forget about how many steps ahead to the factor.</v>

6713
03:08:00.990 --> 03:08:02.490
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people thought this is a wash.</v>

6714
03:08:02.491 --> 03:08:04.980
<v Speaker 5>They thought that Tim Elliot was out of his league,</v>

6715
03:08:04.981 --> 03:08:07.120
<v Speaker 5>this guy and a for submitted.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We're looking at a great fight.</v>

6717
03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:11.040
<v Speaker 5>So all bullshit aside.</v>

<v Speaker 5>we're were intoxicated and we're not serious.</v>

6723
03:08:19.450 --> 03:08:20.490
<v Speaker 5>So we need to know,</v>

6724
03:08:20.491 --> 03:08:22.980
<v Speaker 5>like if you looking at the actual fight itself,</v>

6725
03:08:23.010 --> 03:08:24.390
<v Speaker 5>if this is a great,</v>

6726
03:08:24.391 --> 03:08:25.224
<v Speaker 5>great fight,</v>

6727
03:08:25.230 --> 03:08:27.450
<v Speaker 5>and Tim Elliot deserves all the respect in,</v>

6728
03:08:27.451 --> 03:08:28.800
<v Speaker 5>the world should be ranked the top five.</v>

6729
03:08:28.801 --> 03:08:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Even when he loses his fight.</v>

6730
03:08:29.911 --> 03:08:30.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying he's going to lose,</v>

6731
03:08:30.871 --> 03:08:31.531
<v Speaker 5>but if he does,</v>

6732
03:08:31.531 --> 03:08:34.470
<v Speaker 5>you have to rank them in the top five amazing performance.</v>

6733
03:08:34.471 --> 03:08:35.221
<v Speaker 5>Change your stance.</v>

6734
03:08:35.221 --> 03:08:36.054
<v Speaker 5>Now it's too late.</v>

6735
03:08:36.810 --> 03:08:38.670
<v Speaker 5>You can't change your stance in the middle of a fight.</v>

6736
03:08:38.700 --> 03:08:41.360
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing performance masses and pound per person or one anyway.</v>

6737
03:08:41.790 --> 03:08:42.181
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6738
03:08:42.181 --> 03:08:44.640

6739
03:08:45.210 --> 03:08:45.991
<v Speaker 5>what you've seen,</v>

6743
03:08:49.740 --> 03:08:53.480
<v Speaker 5>You have to add this in and in this fight he's getting dominated on in Granix</v>

6744
03:08:53.481 --> 03:08:55.380
<v Speaker 5>changes by 10 million by a guy who's not right.</v>

6745
03:08:55.381 --> 03:08:56.840
<v Speaker 5>The top 15 right.</v>

6746
03:08:56.850 --> 03:08:58.080
<v Speaker 5>You have to add that in.</v>

6747
03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:59.070
<v Speaker 5>If you want to be objective,</v>

6748
03:08:59.071 --> 03:08:59.940
<v Speaker 5>you have to add that in.</v>

6749
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:01.620
<v Speaker 5>So then you'd have to look at him.</v>

6750
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:02.341
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to like,</v>

6753
03:09:08.161 --> 03:09:10.860
<v Speaker 5>the TJ victory and then the domination over your RHY favorite,</v>

6757
03:09:12.680 --> 03:09:14.610

6875
03:12:32.981 --> 03:12:33.814
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

6876
03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6877
03:12:35.230 --> 03:12:38.050
<v Speaker 5>Now we're going to know when I just said now it's totally different because</v>

6878
03:12:38.051 --> 03:12:38.801
<v Speaker 5>they're inside control.</v>

6879
03:12:38.801 --> 03:12:41.830
<v Speaker 5>How is this idea just trying to set up right there.</v>

6880
03:12:42.030 --> 03:12:42.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6881
03:12:42.460 --> 03:12:44.970
<v Speaker 5>he's got old now.</v>

6882
03:12:44.980 --> 03:12:46.170
<v Speaker 5>His left arm was in a good spot.</v>

6883
03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:46.961
<v Speaker 5>Fights with his eyes.</v>

6884
03:12:46.961 --> 03:12:48.190
<v Speaker 5>His left arm was in a good spot.</v>

6885
03:12:50.110 --> 03:12:50.943
<v Speaker 5>Good spot.</v>

6886
03:12:51.220 --> 03:12:52.340
<v Speaker 5>If his left arm is on,</v>

6887
03:12:52.341 --> 03:12:54.530
<v Speaker 5>the other side of Demeter has had as a basketball,</v>

6888
03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:55.393
<v Speaker 5>that's where he,</v>

6889
03:12:55.690 --> 03:12:56.220
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6890
03:12:56.220 --> 03:12:58.570
<v Speaker 5>So he's got to keep it on this side of it was framing loss.</v>

6891
03:12:58.660 --> 03:13:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Always frame with that frame.</v>

6892
03:13:00.530 --> 03:13:03.680
<v Speaker 5>That's the frame that's didn't want to go on the other side like this.</v>

6893
03:13:03.681 --> 03:13:04.371
<v Speaker 5>Doris from,</v>

6894
03:13:04.371 --> 03:13:07.850
<v Speaker 5>do you ever hit that Doris from one guys pass into your side control?</v>

6895
03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:08.191
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6896
03:13:08.191 --> 03:13:12.310
<v Speaker 5>do you ever let guys out of half guard inside control to catch that in this</v>

6897
03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:13.161
<v Speaker 5>situation?</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's super technical.</v>

6899
03:13:14.071 --> 03:13:14.571
<v Speaker 5>What I would do,</v>

6900
03:13:14.571 --> 03:13:15.404

6955
03:14:56.590 --> 03:15:00.320

7011
03:16:36.911 --> 03:16:37.520

7017
03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:51.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's more of a control.</v>

7018
03:16:51.721 --> 03:16:54.240
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more of like he's just trying to be who he wants to be</v>

<v Speaker 5>caught it and oh my God,</v>

7026
03:17:21.770 --> 03:17:22.603

<v Speaker 5>I want to keep my mouth shut.</v>

7030
03:17:26.610 --> 03:17:27.800

03:17:27.840 --> 03:17:28.673
<v Speaker 5>We don't want to go there.</v>

7032
03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:31.290
<v Speaker 5>It seems like all of us are talking over everybody.</v>

7033
03:17:31.380 --> 03:17:32.150
<v Speaker 5>We need to stop.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7051
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:12.210
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to grapple each other.</v>

7052
03:18:12.211 --> 03:18:14.300
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with uh,</v>

7053
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:15.403
<v Speaker 5>feed production.</v>

7054
03:18:15.850 --> 03:18:17.160
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with that.</v>

7055
03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:18.960
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be interesting cause from mighty mouse,</v>

7056
03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:24.020
<v Speaker 5>you know he was putting Elliot and danger more than Elliot was putting him in</v>

7057
03:18:24.271 --> 03:18:24.651
<v Speaker 5>danger.</v>

7058
03:18:24.651 --> 03:18:25.530
<v Speaker 5>Then that one time.</v>

7059
03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:26.993
<v Speaker 5>One time.</v>

7060
03:18:27.370 --> 03:18:29.020
<v Speaker 5>One time when this fight,</v>

7061
03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:31.680
<v Speaker 5>that's racist.</v>

7062
03:18:31.681 --> 03:18:32.520
<v Speaker 5>Come on man,</v>

7063
03:18:32.670 --> 03:18:33.570
<v Speaker 5>that's real burst.</v>

7064
03:18:33.571 --> 03:18:35.580
<v Speaker 5>That's a reverse racist is going forward again.</v>

7065
03:18:36.110 --> 03:18:36.721
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Bravo.</v>

7066
03:18:36.721 --> 03:18:37.740
<v Speaker 5>What's he doing wrong here?</v>

7067
03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

7068
03:18:38.610 --> 03:18:39.361
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

7069
03:18:39.361 --> 03:18:40.790
<v Speaker 5>He's not doing anything wrong right here.</v>

7070
03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:42.480
<v Speaker 5>Look how he's got control of that risk.</v>

7071
03:18:42.610 --> 03:18:42.970
<v Speaker 5>If he,</v>

7072
03:18:42.970 --> 03:18:43.350
<v Speaker 5>if he,</v>

7073
03:18:43.350 --> 03:18:46.020
<v Speaker 5>if he just really puts all his weight on his hand instead of the risk,</v>

7074
03:18:46.021 --> 03:18:46.854
<v Speaker 5>that's even better.</v>

7075
03:18:46.930 --> 03:18:48.010
<v Speaker 5>But he lost control.</v>

7076
03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:50.320
<v Speaker 4>He tried to switch hands it looks like,</v>

7077
03:18:50.380 --> 03:18:51.310
<v Speaker 4>like in that position,</v>

7078
03:18:51.311 --> 03:18:52.300
<v Speaker 4>when you pin that hand down,</v>

7079
03:18:52.690 --> 03:18:54.550
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people like to pin that wrist down.</v>

7080
03:18:54.670 --> 03:18:58.090
<v Speaker 4>It's better to fucking grab that hand because when you grab that hand and you</v>

7081
03:18:58.091 --> 03:18:58.924
<v Speaker 4>pin it down,</v>

7082
03:18:58.990 --> 03:19:00.670
<v Speaker 4>they can't move that arm at all.</v>

7083
03:19:00.671 --> 03:19:02.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a like a tremendous difference.</v>

7084
03:19:03.100 --> 03:19:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Although shit,</v>

7085
03:19:04.531 --> 03:19:05.364
<v Speaker 4>I can</v>

7086
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.391
<v Speaker 4>look at that.</v>

7087
03:19:07.391 --> 03:19:08.560
<v Speaker 4>Elliot going towards the Camorra.</v>

7088
03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

7089
03:19:09.631 --> 03:19:10.464
<v Speaker 4>Look at those.</v>

7090
03:19:10.520 --> 03:19:12.820

7095
03:19:17.820 --> 03:19:18.653
<v Speaker 4>He turns to her.</v>

7096
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:20.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

7101
03:19:31.020 --> 03:19:32.170
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna go full guard from here.</v>

7102
03:19:32.171 --> 03:19:33.050
<v Speaker 4>He's going to keep those under.</v>

7103
03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:35.200
<v Speaker 4>What is he going to do from,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's going to go to full guard for bear.</v>

7106
03:19:36.701 --> 03:19:36.851
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

7107
03:19:36.851 --> 03:19:38.070
<v Speaker 4>he's got the feet up on the hips,</v>

7108
03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:39.590
<v Speaker 4>but he's letting another,</v>

7109
03:19:40.330 --> 03:19:41.950
<v Speaker 4>we'll see what he wants to.</v>

7110
03:19:41.950 --> 03:19:42.411
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

7111
03:19:42.411 --> 03:19:43.244

7112
03:19:43.250 --> 03:19:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

7113
03:19:44.080 --> 03:19:44.471
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

03:19:44.471 --> 03:19:45.520
<v Speaker 4>so now he's got,</v>

7115
03:19:45.640 --> 03:19:46.473
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

7116
03:19:46.660 --> 03:19:47.493
<v Speaker 4>These points,</v>

7117
03:19:47.740 --> 03:19:49.090
<v Speaker 4>there's so much gain from there.</v>

7118
03:19:49.091 --> 03:19:49.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

7119
03:19:49.610 --> 03:19:50.830
<v Speaker 4>how hard are you going?</v>

7120
03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:52.570
<v Speaker 4>It's a whole different game from here.</v>

7121
03:19:53.100 --> 03:19:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Energy when you know there's only a minute left though.</v>

7122
03:19:55.210 --> 03:19:58.450
<v Speaker 4>This is all I get a few seconds for grueling fight.</v>

7123
03:19:59.230 --> 03:20:00.190
<v Speaker 4>They got to wonder.</v>

7124
03:20:00.380 --> 03:20:03.820
<v Speaker 4>This is so technical to keeping that top half position.</v>

7125
03:20:03.870 --> 03:20:04.703
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

7126
03:20:05.230 --> 03:20:07.190
<v Speaker 4>It's going to go over with him with Aa.</v>

7127
03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Slash he would his hand if he would've went to Maya strategy.</v>

7128
03:20:12.191 --> 03:20:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Just straight up.</v>

7129
03:20:13.240 --> 03:20:14.260
<v Speaker 4>Forget the Camorra.</v>

7130
03:20:14.430 --> 03:20:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I forgot the arm bar.</v>

7131
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Let's get the top half and then get,</v>

7132
03:20:18.200 --> 03:20:20.720
<v Speaker 4>get me free and then go to three winter.</v>

7133
03:20:20.810 --> 03:20:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Lose win is a win in that fight because now fans like,</v>

7157
03:20:56.500 --> 03:20:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

7158
03:20:57.461 --> 03:21:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to a lot of shit in that fight and barely paying a hundred percent</v>

7159
03:21:01.060 --> 03:21:01.350
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>

7160
03:21:01.350 --> 03:21:02.440
<v Speaker 4>The control doc.</v>

7161
03:21:03.340 --> 03:21:04.600
<v Speaker 4>He was in trouble in the early rounds,</v>

7162
03:21:04.601 --> 03:21:05.940
<v Speaker 4>but he definitely controlled trotting off.</v>

7163
03:21:06.380 --> 03:21:10.030
<v Speaker 4>Well if I looked at moments where it looked like he was getting the better of</v>

7164
03:21:10.031 --> 03:21:10.240
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

7165
03:21:10.240 --> 03:21:11.500
<v Speaker 4>I would give him the advantage.</v>

7166
03:21:11.530 --> 03:21:13.300
<v Speaker 4>But there was definitely a few moments.</v>

7167
03:21:13.330 --> 03:21:14.470
<v Speaker 4>It was a competitive fight.</v>

7168
03:21:15.530 --> 03:21:16.363
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

7169
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:17.021
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>

7170
03:21:17.021 --> 03:21:18.600
<v Speaker 4>whether he won or loss.</v>

7171
03:21:18.620 --> 03:21:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

7172
03:21:18.860 --> 03:21:19.421
<v Speaker 4>Whoever,</v>

7173
03:21:19.421 --> 03:21:20.254
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

7174
03:21:20.410 --> 03:21:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Was that the toughest challenge for Demetrius Johnson so far?</v>

7175
03:21:24.610 --> 03:21:27.640
<v Speaker 4>First champion or the second or third?</v>

7176
03:21:27.641 --> 03:21:28.600
<v Speaker 4>John Uranga.</v>

7177
03:21:28.601 --> 03:21:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Kraemer two.</v>

7178
03:21:29.380 --> 03:21:31.480
<v Speaker 4>Number three was the number one thing submitted them.</v>

7179
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Who was number one was this number one.</v>

7180
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Number one challenge.</v>

7181
03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:35.830
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

7182
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:38.110
<v Speaker 4>Morocco put him in the worst dish rematch.</v>

7183
03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Rematch on this right away.</v>

7184
03:21:39.611 --> 03:21:41.950
<v Speaker 4>That'll be a fucking nice papers to one though.</v>

7185
03:21:41.951 --> 03:21:42.520
<v Speaker 4>In this fight.</v>

7186
03:21:42.520 --> 03:21:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately he won.</v>

7187
03:21:43.850 --> 03:21:44.591
<v Speaker 4>I still won.</v>

7188
03:21:44.591 --> 03:21:45.560
<v Speaker 4>He won the round.</v>

7189
03:21:46.370 --> 03:21:47.440
<v Speaker 5>He wins.</v>

7190
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:52.750
<v Speaker 5>But it just like rocky one Monday at one 25 but rocky,</v>

7191
03:21:53.061 --> 03:21:54.650
<v Speaker 5>but we put on a 35.</v>

7192
03:21:55.150 --> 03:21:56.030
<v Speaker 5>There's no fights for him.</v>

7193
03:21:56.031 --> 03:21:57.950
<v Speaker 5>He needs to go up and fight.</v>

7194
03:21:57.951 --> 03:21:58.491
<v Speaker 5>Fight Cruise.</v>

7195
03:21:58.491 --> 03:21:58.770
<v Speaker 5>Cruise.</v>

7196
03:21:58.770 --> 03:21:59.210
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

7197
03:21:59.210 --> 03:22:00.170
<v Speaker 5>And they fought before.</v>

7198
03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:02.750
<v Speaker 5>And one that you got to wonder,</v>

7199
03:22:03.650 --> 03:22:04.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

7200
03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:06.170
<v Speaker 5>at this stage in the guy's career,</v>

7201
03:22:06.650 --> 03:22:06.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

03:22:08.060 --> 03:22:10.490
<v Speaker 5>how many challenges does he have other than Elliot?</v>

7205
03:22:12.500 --> 03:22:13.333
<v Speaker 5>That'd be Xero.</v>

7206
03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:13.671

7212
03:22:25.410 --> 03:22:26.243

03:25:49.500 --> 03:25:52.330
<v Speaker 4>like thinking on your goddamn fee play by play guys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>post fire buddies.</v>
