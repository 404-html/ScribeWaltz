00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was a seal recruiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got invited to mit smart ass</v>

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dming knuckle dragger and um,</v>

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>he was just guide the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name but he was like the</v>

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>top head head guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old white guy,</v>

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:20.994
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>all genius doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were on this panel and they were</v>

9
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>asking us all these questions about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

10
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>mental toughness and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was answering them and I wasn't</v>

11
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>answering any questions and I'll never</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget he was just answered them off of</v>

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never put his fucking ass and shit.</v>

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>You read a bunch of fucking books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that you know how to fucking</v>

14
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>mine works and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had gone through hell to get the kid</v>

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and then all the way up until now.</v>

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>So I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that theory is bullshit.</v>

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good stuff out there.</v>

18
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>You can read from people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had lived hell and when you put</v>

19
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>yourself in hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only time you can figure out</v>

20
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck to get through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't read somebody else's book</v>

22
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>about some theory on how to do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy who set up in there a nice warm</v>

23
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>office in [inaudible] and wrote some</v>
<v Speaker 1>book with a Nice Cup of coffee in the</v>

24
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.544
<v Speaker 1>fucking hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

25
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that guy who immerse</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in fucking hell and he</v>

26
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>thought about quitting and leaving and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

27
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and his wife and his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why am I here?</v>

28
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>

29
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>All this crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still said if found out a way to get</v>

30
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically that's the,</v>

31
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>that's the bottom line of it all.</v>

32
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>We all want to read about how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly get somewhere.</v>

33
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's six minute abs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of Shit.</v>

34
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So powerful did you may get some results</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>

35
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but they're not permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The permanent result comes from you</v>

36
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it all time.</v>

37
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make that a tattoo on your</v>

38
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when that hard time comes again,</v>

39
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may forget it for a second,</v>

40
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>but you can go back in the cookie jar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it.</v>

41
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we've all endured.</v>

42
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I call it the cookie jar and we often</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget how hard we are,</v>

43
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>but you got to reflect back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a couple of seconds,</v>

44
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been through this,</v>

45
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:18.561
<v Speaker 1>I've been through that and then remind</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself I'm a bad motherfucker and then</v>

46
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you can get through that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't believe it,</v>

47
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you haven't endorsed Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just blowing smoke.</v>

48
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a lesson because I</v>

49
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>think that what we did actually was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>fairly simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was we played it by ear and the</v>

51
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>stuff that didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we chucked it.</v>

52
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>And the stuff that did work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we augmented it.</v>

53
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>And so there are no hard and fast rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>You're also banking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're both very unusually smart and</v>

55
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>open minded with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found each other.</v>

56
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I think open mindedness point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important and smart.</v>

57
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like being able to look at each</v>

58
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>other with compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>this is true for any interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.153
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

61
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>can I look at you and see you as a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being with real emotions and feelings</v>

62
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and reality to your experiences as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I feel like we disagree</v>

63
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even,</v>

64
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we're at our angriest with</v>

65
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can see each other's humanity</v>

66
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>through it and you get through.</v>

67
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

68
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 2>That is a lesson for every human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all walks of life,</v>

69
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 2>in any situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you disagree with someone,</v>

70
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>not just your lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just a friend,</v>

71
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 2>but people that you don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

72
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to dehumanize someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagrees with you.</v>

73
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think to bring this all back</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

74
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.660
<v Speaker 2>this is a part of the problem with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>male female interaction today is this</v>

75
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>dehumanization on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the men are demons,</v>

76
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>that the woman are this and the men of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

77
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 2>it's these rash generalizations in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme tribalism.</v>

79
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

80
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is kind of a secret weapon and I,</v>

81
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to seek it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secret is,</v>

82
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heather and I have a whole second</v>

83
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>channel on which to navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we both know the same</v>

84
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:15.780
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.930
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that's important.</v>

87
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You can very often understand more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a given human interaction,</v>

88
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>especially a contentious one if you turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the sound,</v>

89
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't hear what's being said and</v>

90
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>that sounds wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.693
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe the most important piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information you could have is what these</v>

93
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>people are saying to each other as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're arguing.</v>

94
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how human beings work.</v>

95
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the important information is</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that vocal channel and sometimes the</v>

96
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 1>vocal channel is actually almost purely</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise.</v>

97
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if both literally and</v>

98
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if heather and I both know that,</v>

99
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>then there's a part of us that's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>always outside if we,</v>

100
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't fight that much.</v>

101
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.360
<v Speaker 1>It's really pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

102
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do,</v>

103
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 1>there's also a part of us that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the interaction and um,</v>

104
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>knows that a certain pattern may have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfold in order for us to get to the</v>

105
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>other part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>sometimes heather needs to be engaging</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theater at some level,</v>

107
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>even though neither of us wants to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to put it.</v>

108
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Engaging in couples theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

109
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.630
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>

110
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the perfect example of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

111
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about Peterson and go</v>

112
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.150
<v Speaker 1>into work and wearing makeup and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

113
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 1>am I sending sexual signals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will,</v>

114
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all involved in weird stuff.</v>

115
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you and your mate could</v>

116
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.350
<v Speaker 1>both be aware that your argument is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

117
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.600

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:48.720
<v Speaker 1>if it's theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can just skip it.</v>

120
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.883
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

121
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things that have to happen in</v>

122
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:54.900
<v Speaker 1>order for you to get to the next act.</v>

123
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.540
<v Speaker 2>There were so many of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

124
00:05:56.541 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 2>how many did we start out with that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics or former alcoholics?</v>

<v Speaker 3>were an open or a Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the criteria,</v>

<v Speaker 3>minutes to open number two,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that you can take these Dui headliners</v>

<v Speaker 3>Because none of them had licenses.</v>

132
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 3>So I can remember like picking up Gavin</v>
<v Speaker 3>pickin up,</v>

133

<v Speaker 3>wherever and then you couldn't leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>early cause you were driving them home.</v>

135
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>They'd give you a few bucks for gas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were happy to do it.</v>

136
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're working in Framingham.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You get to drive the feature and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>headliner out.</v>

140
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>And I go downtown to pick them up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of Nick's and I've got a a,</v>

141
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 3>I had a 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four cylinder rusted out floorboards and</v>

142
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I get down there and it's Mike Sullivan</v>
<v Speaker 3>Irwin who weighed about 300 pounds and</v>

143
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:04.841
<v Speaker 3>John Pinette who is about to 75 and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw my car and they both started</v>

144
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 3>giggling like schoolgirls like we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fucking go to a Gig and this</v>

145
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.930
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've,</v>

146
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 3>we pack them in and as I couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

147
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get the car going above like</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 so instead of taking the mass pike at</v>

148
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:20.700
<v Speaker 3>west of Framingham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to take a route nine the whole</v>

149
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The open,</v>

150
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 3>get it packed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

151
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:30.731
<v Speaker 3>Like you carrying lumber on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking 800 pounds of humans in my car.</v>

152
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.990
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this stupid ad you have to watch for</v>

154
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:40.740
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Olympics is,</v>

156
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Olympics are gross.</v>

157
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.670
<v Speaker 2>This is why I think the Olympics are</v>
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>

158
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a great opportunity for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those athletes.</v>

159
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great for people to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

160
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.250
<v Speaker 2>but I think it is a fucking disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 2>money grab and all those amateur air</v>

161
00:07:57.251 --> 00:08:00.100
<v Speaker 2>quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Athletes don't get paid shit and these</v>

162
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 2>companies are making billions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars off of them and I</v>

163
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:05.950
<v Speaker 2>really wish they would all quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wished they would say,</v>

164
00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:08.770
<v Speaker 2>fuck you pay me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wished they would just go</v>

165
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:11.950
<v Speaker 2>straight ray Liotta they give you pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

166
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 2>they'd get up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're youth for the,</v>

167
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking companies,</v>

168
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>they're so restrictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the IOC and all the people that</v>

169
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 2>are behind it are so restrictive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are making ungodly sums of money,</v>

170
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.940
<v Speaker 2>ungodly contracts.</v>

171
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.970
<v Speaker 2>They're just giant contracts to air the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics,</v>

172
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 2>giant amounts of money to build the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stadiums and set up.</v>

173
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 2>These are these events and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is about net nationalism and</v>

174
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 2>national pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in Korea or Russia or</v>

175
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:44.830
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile the athletes don't get</v>

176
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.540
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get Dick.</v>

177
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky and you're Michael</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's Lindsey Vaughn,</v>

192
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 2>she's very famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very famous that she,</v>

193
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.730
<v Speaker 2>she used to date tiger woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

194
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 2>That made her famous too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus she's hot.</v>

195
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.350
<v Speaker 2>That makes her famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's peekaboo street shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Interesting names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like helped her.</v>

197
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 2>She's a gold medal winner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

198
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 2>How many other ones are there is a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

199
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a handful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can build a story around someone</v>

200
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 2>and then they cancel story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you get to the point where it's</v>

201
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it actually pays off,</v>

202
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds?</v>

203
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile people are tuning in to</v>

204
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:55.434
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

205
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 2>They're making massive amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>revenue from all of it.</v>

206
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 2>And they're not sharing it with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes at all.</v>

207
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pretend it's amateur,</v>

208
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.860
