00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a paper article I just saw from</v>

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>somebody posted it I think on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>it was they ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled a guy as an old newspaper</v>

4
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:16.911
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fold guys,</v>

5
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:21.911
<v Speaker 1>whether it's okay to spank a woman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answers.</v>

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>They pulled like five or six guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the old article and they were</v>

7
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely like she needs it.</v>

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.530
<v Speaker 2>If she's out of line and she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know she's doing just trying to help</v>

9
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was hilarious.</v>

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a woman needs it,</v>

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 2>should she be spanked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best part about it was rich read it.</v>

12
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's read it</v>

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>so fucking funny.</v>

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

15
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 2>If they don't know how to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time they're adults,</v>

16
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 2>they should be treated like children and</v>
<v Speaker 2>spanked.</v>

17
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 2>That ought to make them grow up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurry.</v>

18
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll soon get the idea.</v>

19
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the idea.</v>

20
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they deserve it.</v>

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 2>As a barber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of faith in the</v>

22
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 2>hairbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

23
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I think there are certain cases when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is advisable,</v>

24
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 2>when it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason why you shouldn't go</v>

25
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:18.040
<v Speaker 2>right ahead and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't knock the idea.</v>

26
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 2>In my business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man sets a lot of the of store sets a</v>

27
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>lot of store by the results he can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a hairbrush,</v>

28
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 2>properly applied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice little smack.</v>

29
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the counterpoint though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sets a lot of store maybe within the</v>

30
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 2>business term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then,</v>

31
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 2>man sets a lot of store.</v>

32
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready for the counterpoint?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

33
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 2>If there is none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody</v>

34
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best part is everybody takes the</v>

35
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 2>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy parking lot attendant from</v>

36
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you Teddy Galella.</v>

37
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 2>You bet it teaches them who's boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of women tend to forget.</v>

38
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 2>This is a man's world at a lot of men</v>
<v Speaker 2>who stepped down as boss of a family,</v>

39
00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 2>wished they hadn't spanking might help</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back some of the respect they lost.</v>

40
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Look at Teddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that as Joey Diaz,</v>

41
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 2>his cousin with a black oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

42
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 2>cocksucker spank them if they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>William Davis,</v>

43
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>William says the toy factory owner.</v>

44
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them have it coming to them</v>

45
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't,</v>

46
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 2>it will remind them of how well off they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

47
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I subscribe to the theory that an ounce</v>
<v Speaker 2>of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</v>

48
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A little like holtzman.</v>

55
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.810

<v Speaker 2>There's no electric light.</v>

59
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 2>The girls carry water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't wear makeup.</v>

79
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:08.960
<v Speaker 2>babies at the ranch and they talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about one part where they got it like a</v>

83
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:23.421
<v Speaker 4>But it's a long time ago when I did the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight show at one of the,</v>

84
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.670
<v Speaker 4>one of the sets on there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I had a joke with a setup,</v>

85
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:28.740
<v Speaker 4>was kids are like homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

86

<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

88
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.380

<v Speaker 4>listen to the joke.</v>

89
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 4>It's about kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

90
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.634
