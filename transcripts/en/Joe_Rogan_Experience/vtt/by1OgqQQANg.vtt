<v Speaker 2>It has been a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've grown a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hopefully a little of that trickles down</v>

12
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it will.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You look good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look healthy.</v>

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 2>You look at vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a little bit of a beard going.</v>

16
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I've been living in Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about that off air.</v>

17
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

18
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 2>what prompted that decision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Connecticut and unlike</v>

20
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 2>southern California where you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunate enough to still live,</v>

21
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I lived here for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and years ago.</v>

22
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

23
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seasons and uh,</v>

24
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 2>one of them is winter and it tends to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long and it normally Kinda,</v>

25
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda moves into the fall and the spring</v>

26
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 2>a bit.</v>

27
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 2>And so I had been thinking for years</v>
<v Speaker 2>about kind of splitting my time between</v>

28
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Florida and Connecticut because I Love</v>
<v Speaker 2>New England in the summer.</v>

29
00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful this time of year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 2>And I like the beginning of fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 2>with the leaves are still on the trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that cold and it's pretty.</v>

32
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spring is nice too.</v>

33
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:12.671
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

34
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I can forget all the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to move to Florida until</v>

35
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I found out about Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found out about this actually</v>

36
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:25.591
<v Speaker 2>because I read an article interviewing</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Paulson and Halston was John Paul,</v>

37
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 2>John Paulson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire hedge fund guy made a lot</v>

38
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 2>more money than me shorting subprime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the same trade.</v>

39
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't make as much money as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

40
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't start out with nearly</v>

41
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 2>as much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any event,</v>

42
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

43
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 2>but he made a lot of money shorting</v>
<v Speaker 2>subprime and he's a hedge fund guy.</v>

44
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

45
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 2>he was investing down in Puerto Rico and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

46
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's he doing?</v>

47
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on down there?</v>

48
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 2>And I found out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had never known this,</v>

49
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 2>that Puerto Rico as a US territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans who live in Puerto Rico don't</v>

50
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:59.620
<v Speaker 2>have to pay federal income taxes on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money they earn from Puerto Rico,</v>

51
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 2>which would include any of your capital</v>
<v Speaker 2>gains on your investments.</v>

52
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

53
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean all I have to do is move to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico,</v>

54
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 2>don't have to pay any federal income</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes cause anybody can move there.</v>

55
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

56
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 2>a work visa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pick up and move there.</v>

58
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just like moving to another state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

59
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 2>And so the minute you move there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to pay federal income</v>

60
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Puerto Rico has its own taxes.</v>

61
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 2>So you have to pay the Puerto Rico taxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>

62
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 2>And up until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

63
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico's income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think tops out at 30% it's still</v>

64
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 2>cheaper than the u s and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>state income tax.</v>

65
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all you've got,</v>

66
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the 30% but a few years ago,</v>

67
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico got smart and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

68
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 2>how do we attract businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs to move to Puerto Rico if</v>

69
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 2>they're not already here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

70
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 2>let's just drop that income tax down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they basically created these two</v>

71
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.210
<v Speaker 2>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>act 29 22 and act 22 is for individuals.</v>

72
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.961
<v Speaker 2>And it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

73
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>if you move to Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have zero capital gains tax on any</v>

74
00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 2>capital gains and you have zero on any</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in dividends that you earn</v>

75
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>locally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they passed another act,</v>

76
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>which is at 20 and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

77
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>if you open up a business here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a company,</v>

78
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay a 4% corporate tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Puerto Rico,</v>

79
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 2>and then you can pass on all the profits</v>
<v Speaker 2>in dividends to yourself,</v>

80
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>tax free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tax in Puerto Rico,</v>

81
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>no tax in the United States.</v>

82
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

83
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>that's a great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be worth a tremendous</v>

84
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

85
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on,</v>

86
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 2>but you effectively double your income</v>
<v Speaker 2>by moving there practically.</v>

87
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not,</v>

88
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not splitting your income with</v>

89
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:34.280
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

90
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.113
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

91
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.651
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

92
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 2>and so I checked it out when I heard out</v>
<v Speaker 2>about front,</v>

93
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>heard about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because first it's like Puerto Rico.</v>

94
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:40.781
<v Speaker 2>Do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 2>do I really want to live there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

96
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking west side story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

97
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

98
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful.</v>

99
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in a town called Dorado beach.</v>

100
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

101
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

102
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

103
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.721
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>the weather and just the tropical</v>
<v Speaker 2>location and there's a lot of good</v>

105
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have been moving there.</v>

106
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm not the first person to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take advantage of this.</v>

107
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 2>And so there are a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have come from California to get out of,</v>

108
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California taxes or the northeast,</v>

109
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 2>the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 2>plus when you come from the Midwest or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the northeast,</v>

111
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 2>help yourself get out of the cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather,</v>

113
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much all a tax thing.</v>

114
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's leaving southern California,</v>

115
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than really the taxes because you</v>

116
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 2>got such great weather here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

117
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.551
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

118
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 2>we enjoy living there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife enjoys it.</v>

119
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 2>She's met a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met a lot of people.</v>

120
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy thing is,</v>

121
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this movement now in Puerto</v>

122
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Rico where they want to become a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous because if they</v>

123
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>became a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the problems they have would be that</v>

124
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 2>much worse because Puerto Rico is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble today,</v>

125
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay federal income taxes there.</v>

126
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what happened was the Puerto Rican</v>

127
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>government is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was very socialist.</v>

128
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>They borrowed a lot of money and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spend a lot of money to get</v>

130
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

131
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in Puerto Rico work for</v>

132
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 2>the government and a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>on welfare,</v>

133
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 2>food stamps and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But big government is what destroyed the</v>

134
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

135
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 2>and they borrowed a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if on top of that,</v>

136
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican residents that actually had</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs had to pay the federal income tax,</v>

137
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the federal income tax</v>

138
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>doesn't apply down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the obamacare tax.</v>

139
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wanted obamacare repealed.</v>

140
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>If you move to Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've repealed it for yourself because</v>

141
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 2>the taxes don't apply down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have to pay the federal</v>

142
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 2>gas tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So without all those taxes,</v>

143
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 2>they're still in trouble.</v>

144
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 2>So can you imagine how much worse it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be if they had all these taxes?</v>

145
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 2>If all of a sudden the irs descended on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Puerto Rico,</v>

146
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 2>like an infestation of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 2>mosquitoes and be worse than the Zika</v>
<v Speaker 2>virus down there to have the irs.</v>

148
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

149
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people,</v>

150
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 2>they've told a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

151
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>if we become a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get more welfare.</v>

152
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.651
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

153
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 2>so vote to become a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what Puerto Rico,</v>

154
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they need is a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more incentives to be on welfare.</v>

155
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need freedom.</v>

156
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 2>They need less government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to default on a lot of this</v>

157
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the people that own the</v>

158
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 2>bonds unfortunately have to lose some</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

159
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 2>But I think that as more and more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>move to Puerto Rico,</v>

160
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I've got two businesses down there now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hiring people,</v>

161
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm renting space.</v>

162
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I bought a lot of property down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

163
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 2>more and more people like me as people</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to Puerto Rico,</v>

164
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>the economy's going to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get better.</v>

165
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they become a state,</v>

166
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.250
<v Speaker 2>they're going to destroy all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

167
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to exploit the fact that</v>

168
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico can offer such a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage to a businessman.</v>

169
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Somebody he wants to create a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>employee,</v>

170
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 2>people provide goods and services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do it in Puerto Rico.</v>

171
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I know on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a much favorable,</v>

172
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis relative to anywhere in the</v>

173
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>continental United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a recent thing for you.</v>

174
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been down there for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

175
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I moved by asset management company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a company called Euro Pacific</v>

176
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 2>asset management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I moved that company from southern</v>

177
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was based in Newport beach with that</v>

178
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:56.351
<v Speaker 2>business and I moved to San Juan I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2013 and then I moved to Toronto.</v>

179
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 2>So I have my office there and I moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my portfolio managers,</v>

180
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 2>they all moved from California to Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rico.</v>

181
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a tough sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

182
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 2>they love it down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But was it difficult to convince people</v>

183
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 2>to pack up to which essentially another</v>
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>

184
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of it it's America.</v>

185
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically it's not like that kind of a</v>

186
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

187
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>well it's the same status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never been to Guam.</v>

188
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 2>But I mean you do feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does feel a little bit like a foreign</v>

189
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 2>country when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because English is the second language.</v>

190
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is speaking Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a way,</v>

191
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all you look around,</v>

192
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 2>it's all the same restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same stores.</v>

193
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 2>So it's American in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

194
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.891
<v Speaker 2>all the malls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 2>the same malls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot of ex,</v>

196
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Speaker 2>not really ex pats because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually still in America.</v>

197
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not renounce your citizenship</v>

198
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 2>when you move to Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not have to pay an exit tax.</v>

199
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I you still travel on on an on a US</v>
<v Speaker 2>passport.</v>

200
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that lives there is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>

201
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a sweeter deal than moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Hawaii.</v>

202
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Well Hawaii you got high taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still paying federal income</v>

203
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paradise.</v>

204
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus you're paying the state income</v>

205
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>taxes in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

206
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guys wanted to move there cause it</v>

207
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 2>basically almost meant that their income</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to double like pretty much</v>

208
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 2>overnight cause they can participate in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tax breaks.</v>

209
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

210
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 2>one of my guys is married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has some kids and you know,</v>

211
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 2>they really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My single employees,</v>

212
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I have a few young guys you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>good shape working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 2>young portfolio managers but they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>they quickly got Puerto Rican</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends.</v>

216
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got a job down there that's a</v>

217
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>big plus because most of the Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rican guys and out of you know this,</v>

218
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 2>but I think five of the miss universes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of kind of Puerto Rico.</v>

219
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a small little island country,</v>

220
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 2>but they got some beautiful women down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in Puerto Rico.</v>

221
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you're a salesperson for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico a lot.</v>

222
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said so many people down there.</v>

223
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have moved there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

224
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I run into people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see me on the beach.</v>

225
00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>You have to Hell Pete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that you're the reason that I'm</v>

226
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:58.130
<v Speaker 2>here because they heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

227
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.011
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

228
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

229
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see Puerto Rico succeed</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mecca of free market capitalism</v>

230
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

231
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a poster child for the failures of</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism because they,</v>

232
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 2>it's the socialist that killed Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rico,</v>

233
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>just like they're killing a lot of major</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities in the United States.</v>

234
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 2>But if we get more entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more business people are coming to</v>

235
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 2>that is what Puerto Rico needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need to be a state,</v>

237
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't need the irs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need more government.</v>

238
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>They need the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you learn in Spanish or are you just</v>

239
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 2>sort of standing around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

240
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:32.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it.</v>

241
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 2>They're all Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

242
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I speak English.</v>

243
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

244
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I took high school Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

245
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 2>if I go through a dry through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I got to try to use my Spanish because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of times they don't speak.</v>

247
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

248
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>and no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to someone from the police</v>

249
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 2>or the fire department of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak any English.</v>

250
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 2>But most of the younger people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've learned English.</v>

251
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 2>And where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everybody speaks English.</v>

252
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody addresses me once I get out of</v>

253
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>the gates of the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Rich Carlton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I go out into a movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

256
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're speaking Spanish.</v>

257
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 2>And then if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you speak English,</v>

258
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 2>then they'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where I live,</v>

259
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 2>everybody addresses everybody in</v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

260
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 2>So in that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 2>you're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you live in like a gated area that's</v>

262
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:14.350
<v Speaker 2>a part of the Ritz Carlton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

263
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a gated community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very large.</v>

264
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of golf course,</v>

265
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 2>so I think three or four golf courses</v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the beach and there's,</v>

266
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:22.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different places to live there.</v>

267
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Any resentment from the locals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I can feel.</v>

268
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>

269
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I know some of the locals could feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

270
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 2>these guys are coming in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not paying a lot of taxes,</v>

271
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 2>but I pay a lot of taxes as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a raw number.</v>

272
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big percentage of what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>earn,</v>

273
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big number relative to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people might be paying.</v>

274
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing all,</v>

275
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm hiring people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

276
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I rented office space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I bought a house,</v>

277
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I bought a condo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going out.</v>

278
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 2>So I mean they benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like having,</v>

279
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like having people doing stuff</v>

280
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>

281
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it at all.</v>

282
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Now if it becomes a state status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it changes status,</v>

283
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 2>will you move?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

284
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have to,</v>

285
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not.</v>

286
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't be nearly as lucrative and see,</v>

287
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 2>here's going to be the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they ever became a state,</v>

288
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 2>see people that live there pay a 30%</v>
<v Speaker 2>income tax.</v>

289
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for to,</v>

290
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not people like me,</v>

291
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 2>but the people that were already there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of like in California you</v>

292
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>have 10 13% income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if you had to pay a 30%</v>

293
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>local tax and the federal income tax on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of that.</v>

294
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have a 13% sales tax now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have a higher sales tax.</v>

295
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 2>So they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they became a state,</v>

296
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.280
<v Speaker 2>they would be by far the highest tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>state in the United States.</v>

297
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>They mean a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now they have the lowest taxes in</v>

298
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why would you want to go from having</v>

299
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>the lowest taxes to having the highest</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes?</v>

300
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be,</v>

301
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 2>it'd be suicide to become a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

302
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 2>So they would have their local taxes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then on top of that they would have</v>

303
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 2>federal taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Local taxes are fairly high in terms of</v>

304
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:52.510
<v Speaker 2>like a local state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

305
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 2>As much higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

306
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

307
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 3>then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have federal taxes.</v>

308
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

309
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing is Puerto Rico has a lot</v>

310
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 4>of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned that,</v>

311
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on a per capita basis,</v>

312
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 4>they actually have a lot less debt than</v>
<v Speaker 4>America does.</v>

313
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your share of the national debt right,</v>

314
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 4>is much bigger than the average Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rican share of the Puerto Rico debt.</v>

315
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Because when you live in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only are you responsible for the</v>

316
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 4>state's debt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're responsible for the national</v>

317
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 4>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people in Puerto Rico,</v>

318
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm not responsible for the national</v>
<v Speaker 4>debt.</v>

319
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 4>So if they actually became a state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would be in worse shape than they</v>

320
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 4>are now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would actually have more debt.</v>

321
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like it'd be like buying a</v>

322
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 4>ticket on the titanic after you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>already,</v>

323
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:36.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hit the iceberg yet you still want to</v>

324
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 4>buy tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So hopefully this is all a bunch of</v>

325
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 4>politics and it won't become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it won't become a state and it'll just</v>

326
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 4>continue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

327
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 4>they'll default on a lot of this debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully they'll prioritize a lot of</v>

328
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

329
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 4>they'll shrink the government and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more people like me will come in and</v>

330
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 4>start creating businesses and hiring</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and you know,</v>

331
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 4>five to 10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you'll be the wealthiest part of</v>

332
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:57.770
<v Speaker 4>the united,</v>

333
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.890
<v Speaker 3>so correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the two possibilities are,</v>

334
00:13:00.891 --> 00:13:03.770
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a state and they get more</v>
<v Speaker 3>welfare.</v>

335
00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:07.050
<v Speaker 3>They get more essentially more aid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more money.</v>

336
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it stays where it is and more people</v>

337
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 3>like you have an incentive to go there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then entrepreneurs open a businesses</v>

338
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.740
<v Speaker 3>and then there's more opportunities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the general wealth of the island</v>

339
00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:22.080
<v Speaker 3>grows and that it helps people just by</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtue of more.</v>

340
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got it.</v>

341
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.890
<v Speaker 4>Becoming a state just means a bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>welfare state.</v>

342
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.030
<v Speaker 4>It means a greater incentive not to work</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a bigger punishment if you work</v>

343
00:13:30.031 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 4>because the taxes on people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that work will go sky high,</v>

344
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.170
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's going to be a huge problem if</v>

345
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.090
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>

346
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.520
<v Speaker 4>The problem that the appeal of being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>state is that so many people don't work.</v>

347
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.830
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that we could do to help</v>

348
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Puerto Rico is get rid of the minimum</v>
<v Speaker 4>wage because they're stuck with our</v>

349
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:50.790
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a disaster because the average</v>

350
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:53.070
<v Speaker 4>income,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average wage in Puerto Rico is about</v>

351
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.030
<v Speaker 4>half of what it is in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the minimum wage of seven 25 is</v>

352
00:13:57.031 --> 00:13:59.400
<v Speaker 4>like having a minimum wage of $15 an</v>
<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>

353
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.010
<v Speaker 4>And if you're one of those people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>likes a $15 minimum wage,</v>

354
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.030
<v Speaker 4>look at how high the unemployment is</v>
<v Speaker 4>down there because you can't,</v>

355
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you people can't get jobs at,</v>

356
00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 4>at these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at these wages.</v>

357
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best example too of America</v>

358
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.160
<v Speaker 4>destroying one of it's a possessions</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the minimum wage was American</v>

359
00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Samoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've ever read this,</v>

360
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:20.580
<v Speaker 4>but a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

361
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.600
<v Speaker 4>Congress applied the minimum wage to all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the territories are minimum wage,</v>

362
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.540
<v Speaker 4>which included American Samoa and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>American Samoa,</v>

363
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.060
<v Speaker 4>the biggest employers on the island</v>
<v Speaker 4>where these tuna canners and so chicken,</v>

364
00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:35.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken of the sea or star cast.</v>

365
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.390
<v Speaker 4>And so all these people worked in these</v>
<v Speaker 4>factories canning the tuna and they</v>

366
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:40.440
<v Speaker 4>worked in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

367
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:41.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in American Samoa.</v>

368
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the mirror and minimum wage was</v>

369
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:47.310
<v Speaker 4>passed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made the island uncompetitive.</v>

370
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And so the tuna factories closed down</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fired everybody.</v>

371
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 4>And so all of a sudden there was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>30% unemployment.</v>

372
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 4>The island went into a massive</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and they still haven't come</v>

373
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:56.751
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

374
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 4>we destroyed them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we destroyed all their jobs.</v>

375
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.580
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

376
00:15:00.581 --> 00:15:02.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the American Samoa didn't want the</v>

377
00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

378
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 4>American politicians don't give a damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all they care about is feeling good</v>

379
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 4>about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not about the consequences of what they</v>

380
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>

381
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

382
00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 4>they impose that minimum wage and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like declaring war.</v>

383
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had a lot of damage in Puerto Rico,</v>

384
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 4>just not as much as it did in American</v>
<v Speaker 4>Samoa.</v>

385
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 4>But if we can get rid of that minimum</v>
<v Speaker 4>wage in Puerto Rico,</v>

386
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 4>then there'd be a lot more employment</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities for younger,</v>

387
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 4>unskilled people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd have the opportunity to climb up</v>

388
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 4>the job ladder to get some skills so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can earn more money in the future.</v>

389
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 4>But right now they're just permanently</v>
<v Speaker 4>unemployed.</v>

390
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.331
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that,</v>

391
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 4>so we could get rid of the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

392
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:38.930
<v Speaker 4>there's the Jones Act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has really,</v>

393
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 4>really hurts Puerto Rico.</v>

394
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 4>And what that Jones Act that says is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that any ship,</v>

395
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that that's going to America.</v>

396
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.900
<v Speaker 4>They can't stop in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drop a few things off,</v>

397
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 4>and then continue on to the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

398
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 4>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to go all the way to the</v>

399
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unload their cargo,</v>

400
00:15:56.661 --> 00:16:00.320
<v Speaker 4>that's going to Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it on a US flag ship with a u s</v>

401
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 4>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then send it back to Puerto Rico.</v>

402
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 4>And it costs a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

403
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 4>So that's one of the reasons that their</v>
<v Speaker 4>tourism is not that competitive there.</v>

404
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Because all the other Caribbean islands</v>
<v Speaker 4>can get cheap stuff dropped off on</v>

405
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.590
<v Speaker 4>boats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

406
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 4>we have to wait for stuff to come on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jones act boat.</v>

407
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:20.930
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the incentive to pass the Jones</v>

408
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:22.820
<v Speaker 4>act?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's for the unions,</v>

409
00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 4>the Maritime Union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the merchant marine to try to,</v>

410
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 4>because you know American ships are</v>
<v Speaker 4>uncompetitive.</v>

411
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Like if you ever go on a cruise on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go on a cruise,</v>

412
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but none of these cruise ships are</v>
<v Speaker 4>flagged in the United States and none of</v>

413
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 4>the crews are American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because if you had to use an</v>

414
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 4>American crew with our laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody could afford to cruise.</v>

415
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 4>It would be too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way that you can have a cruise</v>

416
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 4>line that anybody can afford the travel</v>
<v Speaker 4>on is if you flag it in some other</v>

417
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

418
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.350
<v Speaker 4>so because the wages are just off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>charts,</v>

419
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 4>but that Jones act means if people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Puerto Rico,</v>

420
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're going to buy,</v>

421
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're going to consume in</v>
<v Speaker 4>order to bring it to that island,</v>

422
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to bring it on a,</v>

423
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.970
<v Speaker 4>on a US flag ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it that,</v>

424
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem for Hawaii too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the people in Hawaii are much richer</v>

425
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 4>on average and the people in Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rico,</v>

426
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 4>so the poor you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you're affected by,</v>

427
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 4>by higher food costs are higher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

428
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 4>costs of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

429
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:17.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a lot of these,</v>

430
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal politicians,</v>

431
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 4>they refuse to get rid of these laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that would,</v>

432
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 4>would very much help Puerto Rico just</v>
<v Speaker 4>more free markets cause they,</v>

433
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 4>they have no control over that federal</v>
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage where the or that Jones</v>

434
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Act.</v>

435
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.410
<v Speaker 2>So you don't think there should be any</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage at all?</v>

436
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

437
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.270
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None boat.</v>

438
00:17:31.271 --> 00:17:34.330
<v Speaker 2>So someone working for a dollar an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bother you.</v>

439
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's better than working for</v>

440
00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.264
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

441
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.550
<v Speaker 2>people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

442
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

443
00:17:39.961 --> 00:17:41.770
<v Speaker 2>they want to impose their morals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

444
00:17:41.771 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not right for somebody to work for</v>

445
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.640
<v Speaker 2>a dollar an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

446
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people make rational decisions,</v>

447
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so somebody</v>

448
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 4>is accepting a dollar an hour and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>must mean that nobody offered them a</v>

449
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 4>dollar 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody offered them $2.</v>

450
00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a competitive,</v>

451
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 4>a market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

452
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I know you have an employee over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

453
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 4>could you pay this guy a dollar an hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he worked for you?</v>

454
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.201
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

455
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Well a got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he could get more.</v>

456
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.983
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's,</v>

457
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 4>he's educated and skilled and he's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>engineer and of course,</v>

458
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's very difficult for people to</v>

459
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 4>get that sort of an education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly in wwe is Puerto Rico</v>

460
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 4>thought of as a third world environment</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so country third world.</v>

461
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 4>But let's say some kid came in here that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had no experience whatsoever,</v>

462
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:26.150
<v Speaker 4>but he wanted to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to just get you coffee and</v>

463
00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 4>just sit around and be around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not that productive.</v>

464
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use the interns,</v>

465
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

466
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 4>A lot of radio stations do that and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't pay them anything.</v>

467
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 4>I know that $0 million and I can't do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

468
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 4>Well then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you pay him $5 now,</v>

469
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:39.050
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people,</v>

470
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 4>people are going to accept a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best one they can get,</v>

471
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 4>and so if somebody is working for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar an hour or $2 an hour,</v>

472
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 4>by default,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that they couldn't find a higher</v>

473
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.450
<v Speaker 4>job than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason is because they don't</v>

474
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't have a lot of skills,</v>

475
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 4>the best thing you can do is get a job</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can get some skills.</v>

476
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.970
<v Speaker 4>That's where you learn skills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get more skills.</v>

477
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.010
<v Speaker 4>You know there are people that pay to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get skills,</v>

478
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go to school,</v>

479
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 4>you actually have to pay tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm getting paid a dollar an hour</v>

480
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.760
<v Speaker 4>while I learned something that has</v>
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

481
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.450
<v Speaker 4>that's better.</v>

482
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 4>You have people now borrowing money to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn a skill.</v>

483
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 4>People Graduate College and they're in</v>
<v Speaker 4>debt,</v>

484
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a weird,</v>

485
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

486
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Because you're assuming that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get a skill.</v>

487
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might just be handling packages and</v>

488
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 4>picking them up and moving to another</v>
<v Speaker 4>location.</v>

489
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.770
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole or well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even that's like show up on time,</v>

490
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 4>be responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So disciplines and showed a lot of work.</v>

491
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.620
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of stuff that you learn</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have a job,</v>

492
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:36.621
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with the minimum wage is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the minimum wage basically hurts</v>

493
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 4>the very people that it's intended to</v>
<v Speaker 4>help because the minimum wage basically</v>

494
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:45.801
<v Speaker 4>says if you are a worker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you cannot convince an employer to</v>

495
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:49.660
<v Speaker 4>pay you seven 25 or $10 an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the minimum wage,</v>

496
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 4>then you cannot accept that job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

497
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:53.760
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't hurt the employer.</v>

498
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 4>It hurts the employee because it limits</v>
<v Speaker 4>his options.</v>

499
00:19:57.271 --> 00:20:00.920
<v Speaker 4>It limits his ability to sell his Labor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

500
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.880
<v Speaker 4>for the highest price that he can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it limits his access to the job</v>

501
00:20:05.881 --> 00:20:06.361
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

502
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:07.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't get on that ladder.</v>

503
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

504
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.600
<v Speaker 4>you remove the lower rungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I can't climb up because of this</v>

505
00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:14.320
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

506
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 4>because when you pass a minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to force an employer,</v>

507
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm an employer and there's a minimum</v>

508
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:25.071
<v Speaker 4>wage of $10 an hour and somebody comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me and they can deliver $5 an hour</v>

509
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 4>worth of productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning if I hire that person that will</v>

510
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 4>benefit me by $5 an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to pay them $10 an hour</v>

511
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 4>because then I lose $5 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way I'm going to hire somebody</v>

512
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 4>who's going to give me $5 an hour worth</v>
<v Speaker 4>of productivity is if I can buy them.</v>

513
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.750
<v Speaker 4>If I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

514
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 4>hire him for less than $5 an hour so I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can make a profit.</v>

515
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 4>So it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sits like a floor.</v>

516
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you cannot deliver enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>productivity of whatever that minimum</v>

517
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 4>wages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can't get a job.</v>

518
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 4>And so it's basically making it illegal</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people to work.</v>

519
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 4>It is the stupidest law that anybody has</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever conceived.</v>

520
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be obliterated.</v>

521
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are some countries,</v>

522
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:04.660
<v Speaker 4>like Singapore does not have a minimum</v>
<v Speaker 4>wage.</v>

523
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average income in Singapore is</v>

524
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 4>higher than it is here per capita.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot more millionaires there.</v>

525
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:11.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have no problem.</v>

526
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 4>We didn't always have a minimum wage in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States.</v>

527
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a creation of government and you</v>

528
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:17.981
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

529
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 4>the initial minimum wages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to actually go to the</v>

530
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:22.390
<v Speaker 4>origins of minimum wage in the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>

531
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.570
<v Speaker 4>it was about trying to prevent employers</v>
<v Speaker 4>from hiring the Chinese or hiring</v>

532
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 4>blacks.</v>

533
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.780
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to force them in ways</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a way to create unemployment.</v>

534
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a,</v>

535
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 4>a good motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yes,</v>

536
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:37.910
<v Speaker 4>when they try to sell it to the voters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

537
00:21:37.911 --> 00:21:40.450
<v Speaker 4>it was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't want people to be exploited,</v>

538
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not exploitation of people</v>

539
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily accept the job because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best job they can find.</v>

540
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 4>The person who's offering the best job</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not exploiting them.</v>

541
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 4>They're giving them an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're denied an opportunity,</v>

542
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of people,</v>

543
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 4>oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know they're going to get the</v>

544
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage up to $15 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

545
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 4>what good is it being unemployed at $15</v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour?</v>

546
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 4>It's better to be employed at $5 an hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>than unemployed at 15 because being</v>

547
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 4>unemployed means you make nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

548
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 4>We're devil's advocate would be that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't afford to pay someone $15 an</v>

549
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.540
<v Speaker 4>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you probably shouldn't have</v>

550
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 4>employees in the first place.</v>

551
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Your Business doesn't function that</v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

552
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.400
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are plenty of sense.</v>

553
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there are plenty of jobs where</v>

554
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 4>you have entry level positions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

555
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:25.660
<v Speaker 4>if you think that there should be no</v>
<v Speaker 4>entry level jobs,</v>

556
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:30.661
<v Speaker 4>I mean you go back to the days of a full</v>
<v Speaker 4>service gas stations right?</v>

557
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Back in the day when you know you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to pump your own gas till the case</v>

558
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 4>in New Jersey and a few other states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey,</v>

559
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:37.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they mandate it,</v>

560
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 4>but you still don't get the level of</v>
<v Speaker 4>service.</v>

561
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've pulled into a gas station 40</v>

562
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only did they pump your gas,</v>

563
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:45.970
<v Speaker 4>but they checked under your hood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

564
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.650
<v Speaker 4>I used to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tires,</v>

565
00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:48.210
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

566
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:48.641
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

567
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:49.061
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

568
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they watched your windows,</v>

569
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did all sorts of things.</v>

570
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

571
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.470
<v Speaker 4>with your car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't make very much money.</v>

572
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 4>They lived off of tips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By and large it was the minimum wage</v>

573
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 4>that eliminated almost all those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a minimum wage.</v>

574
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.150
<v Speaker 4>That is the reason that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

575
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 4>people sell so much self serve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what happened,</v>

576
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these kids that worked in filling</v>

577
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 4>stations became mechanics because all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these filling stations had a mechanic</v>

578
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 4>there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they learned auto mechanics and a lot of</v>

579
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 4>them went on to own their own gas</v>
<v Speaker 4>stations.</v>

580
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 4>But of course a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was their work experience that</v>

581
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 4>formed the basis for the rest of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

582
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 4>A lot of young kids had these jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>summer jobs.</v>

583
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 4>And so there's nothing wrong with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>entry level employment.</v>

584
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:36.190
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with people</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning the responsibility of having a</v>

585
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 4>job of showing up of customer service of</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>

586
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 4>My first jobs were all sales.</v>

587
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 4>I was selling subscriptions door to</v>
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

588
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 4>I was telephone sales of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the z channel and California.</v>

589
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 4>I sold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was knocking on doors selling cable</v>

590
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 4>television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked in a shoe store selling shoes.</v>

591
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hustler.</v>

592
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 4>But you were talking about you as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>young man,</v>

593
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of people think of the</v>

594
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage as applied to adults.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adults that have to take care of</v>

595
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have to have a roof over their</v>

596
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 4>head and food on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're saying that that,</v>

597
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 4>that they shouldn't be having those</v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>

598
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Well by the time you are an adult with</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

599
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 4>you should have accumulated the skills</v>
<v Speaker 4>to earn a lot more than a minimum wage.</v>

600
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 4>So that's the argument when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

601
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:19.790
<v Speaker 4>you can't afford a family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't support a family on the</v>

602
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:22.430
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course you shouldn't even be trying</v>

603
00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 4>to support a family if you can only earn</v>
<v Speaker 4>the minimum wage.</v>

604
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.270
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

605
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.370
<v Speaker 4>you should realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

606
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 4>I can't afford a family yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me acquire the skills before I start</v>

607
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 4>fathering children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

608
00:24:34.251 --> 00:24:35.360
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and getting married,</v>

609
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.700
<v Speaker 4>let me make sure I can support myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

610
00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people who are having the</v>
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage,</v>

611
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.700
<v Speaker 4>they're living at home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>

612
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

613
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 4>they don't need to pay the rent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're living rent free.</v>

614
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 4>What they need is a job they need maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>gas money,</v>

615
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 4>get some money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I could take a girl out on a date,</v>

616
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 4>but I gotta I gotta get some work</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

617
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:54.110
<v Speaker 4>I got to get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to know what it's like to work.</v>

618
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.220
<v Speaker 4>I got to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

619
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 4>I've got to live in the real world and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what used to happen.</v>

620
00:24:58.041 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have all these summer jobs</v>

621
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids don't have the opportunity because</v>

622
00:25:02.361 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 4>the minimum wage has already priced them</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

623
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 4>A lot of older people now we're taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

624
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:09.410
<v Speaker 4>those jobs and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the employment opportunities aren't</v>

625
00:25:09.411 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you just raised the in wage,</v>

626
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 4>all you're doing is raising the bar</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can get your job.</v>

627
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 4>You're not helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

628
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 4>there is always going to be some people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

629
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be somebody who will</v>

630
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:22.550
<v Speaker 4>make a little bit more because of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>minimum wage.</v>

631
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be some winners,</v>

632
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to have lots of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that make nothing because of the minimum</v>

633
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 4>wage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course,</v>

634
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 4>because you're driving up the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 4>labor prices are going up.</v>

635
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 4>And so who is affected the most by</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher prices,</v>

636
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.820
<v Speaker 4>poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who are working on minimum wage.</v>

637
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not only that,</v>

638
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 4>you end up with less quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

639
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate it when,</v>

640
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call up a company and I'm just in</v>

641
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:46.010
<v Speaker 4>voice mail.</v>

642
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Hell and I'm going from one I would like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real person to deal with.</v>

643
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the minimum wage,</v>

644
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 4>those jobs don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many jobs that have been</v>

645
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 4>automated out of existence because not</v>
<v Speaker 4>automated shipped overseas where there</v>

646
00:25:58.611 --> 00:26:00.830
<v Speaker 4>isn't any minimum that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that too.</v>

647
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:01.664
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You end up,</v>

648
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.920
<v Speaker 4>if you actually get a real person there</v>
<v Speaker 4>in India,</v>

649
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.641
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

650
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 4>But we have all these people in America</v>
<v Speaker 4>who aren't working,</v>

651
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 4>why can't they do those jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

652
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be able to support a</v>
<v Speaker 4>family on those jobs.</v>

653
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.870
<v Speaker 4>But before you even get a family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have that job and then maybe you</v>

654
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five or 10 years later you'll work your</v>

655
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:19.120
<v Speaker 4>way up the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get a skill,</v>

656
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 4>then you can support a family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody is supposed to be able to</v>

657
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.680
<v Speaker 4>support a family and if you try to tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>an employer,</v>

658
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:25.603
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta,</v>

659
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 4>you gotta pay your fry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cook enough money to support a family,</v>

660
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not enough productivity cooking</v>

661
00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:34.070
<v Speaker 4>French fries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't support a family family.</v>

662
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 4>If all you can do is cook a French fry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to learn how to do something</v>

663
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:39.710
<v Speaker 4>else before you can support a family and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

664
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 4>you can't put that on the employer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when you say that Singapore has a</v>

665
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 2>higher average income is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that because and no minimum wage?</v>

666
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Is that because there's a shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaires that have moved to</v>

667
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Singapore because they don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage because they're getting</v>

668
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 2>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No lower class people or people that</v>

669
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 2>don't make much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The millionaires and billionaires don't</v>

670
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 2>eve are really not even affected by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage.</v>

671
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 2>What you'd have to look at is the rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>of unemployment rates in Singapore</v>

672
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 2>sentence for very rich people to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

673
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:12.590
<v Speaker 2>And doesn't that Jack up the minimum</v>
<v Speaker 2>wage or not the minimum wage rather than</v>

674
00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 2>the average income?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

675
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Well the fact that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs that are succeeding in</v>

676
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Singapore because they have small</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and low taxes means that</v>

677
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of competition for</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>

678
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what bids up wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

679
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've got no problem with a</v>

680
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:29.310
<v Speaker 2>vibrant market bidding up wages.</v>

681
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.330
<v Speaker 2>You just don't want the government to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to artificially force wages above</v>

682
00:27:33.331 --> 00:27:34.370
<v Speaker 2>their productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

683
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Because it's ultimately your</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity that determines your wages.</v>

684
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

685
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:39.960
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your employee here,</v>

686
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.080
<v Speaker 2>he has a lot of ads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of value because of his knowledge,</v>

687
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:44.680
<v Speaker 2>because of his personal good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

688
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.540
<v Speaker 2>look at Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that doesn't,</v>

689
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:49.590
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't help me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

690
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

691
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 2>we're laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are a lot of people,</v>

692
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people that earn more</v>

693
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:57.420
<v Speaker 2>money because they're good to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

694
00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 2>There are plenty of people that are paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>more models,</v>

695
00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but you go to Puerto Rico and then Miss</v>
<v Speaker 2>Universe and right.</v>

696
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 2>But even people hire receptionists or</v>
<v Speaker 2>people hire people in certain positions</v>

697
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 2>because they look good and they get paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little extra for that because that's</v>

698
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 2>added value to the customer experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

699
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>So most of us can't live off of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks.</v>

700
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 2>We gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta have some something else,</v>

701
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:17.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's all a function of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>

702
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.010
<v Speaker 2>You want to earn more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to produce more.</v>

703
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Did government just can't mandate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people pay you more than you're worth as</v>

704
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 2>far as the productivity that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver because you're just not going to</v>

705
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 2>have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making a ton of sense.</v>

706
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not a financial wizard</v>

707
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:32.980
<v Speaker 2>like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

708
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.700
<v Speaker 2>when you'd start talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>people making more money for their,</v>

709
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:37.680
<v Speaker 2>looks not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a hot button topic in</v>

710
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:41.760
<v Speaker 2>America and people will get very upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and that people would say that</v>

711
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 2>that's a sexist viewpoint and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectifying these women that you have</v>

712
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>working in these positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say to that?</v>

713
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Like a secretary or someone who's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>receptionist who's super hot,</v>

714
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 2>like the year you're objectifying this</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman?</v>

715
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:54.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:58.050
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men get hired for their looks too.</v>

717
00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a one way street,</v>

718
00:28:59.731 --> 00:29:01.140
<v Speaker 2>amy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you said,</v>

719
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:02.790
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

720
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.340
<v Speaker 2>people make the most of what they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

721
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:05.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

722
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:06.661
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair.</v>

723
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:07.381
<v Speaker 2>Why should this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

724
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 2>it's unfair to the unattractive people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but build the unattractive person could</v>

725
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:13.800
<v Speaker 2>be really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she ends up making mom and ugly.</v>

726
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.551
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:18.340
<v Speaker 2>not everybody wins the lottery life can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them write a little bit.</v>

728
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the problem with socialism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea of we should even out the</v>

729
00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:23.430
<v Speaker 2>playing field?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

730
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that competent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a competition guy,</v>

731
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

732
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 2>a famous Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Kennedy said that life is unfair</v>

733
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and live in a different era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not fair.</v>

734
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just trying to bang a lot of</v>

735
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:36.400
<v Speaker 2>checks and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

736
00:29:36.401 --> 00:29:38.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't dwell on the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have.</v>

737
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could've been born better</v>

738
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:41.850
<v Speaker 2>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could been born tall,</v>

739
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.700
<v Speaker 2>taller.</v>

740
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to make the most,</v>

741
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 4>it's like playing poker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got hand play it,</v>

742
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 4>you can have the worst hand and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>win the pot.</v>

743
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

744
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously is it easier to win the hand</v>

745
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:53.930
<v Speaker 4>if you got four lasers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

746
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know what,</v>

747
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.660
<v Speaker 4>if you're a bad player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll win nothing cause everybody's</v>

748
00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 4>going to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

749
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 4>And so even getting the best hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't necessarily mean you're</v>

750
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 4>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

751
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna play it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

752
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.340
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

753
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:05.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if two people,</v>

754
00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:07.570
<v Speaker 4>if I want to hire somebody and the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look,</v>

755
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 4>I believe is going to help me earn more</v>
<v Speaker 4>money because I think that having a more</v>

756
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:15.350
<v Speaker 4>attractive person and particularly</v>
<v Speaker 4>business position is going to somehow</v>

757
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 4>lead to greater sales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

758
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 4>that's really the only reason that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to pay somebody more money</v>

759
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.350
<v Speaker 4>if they look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like look it on,</v>

760
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go on Fox television or CNBC,</v>

761
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 4>it's not an accident that all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>women interviewing me are pretty hot,</v>

762
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.143
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

763
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.690
<v Speaker 4>unattractive women could read the news</v>
<v Speaker 4>and ask me questions just as good as</v>

764
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 4>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're hoping and they're betting</v>

765
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:39.270
<v Speaker 4>that more guys like us are going to tune</v>
<v Speaker 4>in to watch a hot chick interview me.</v>

766
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Then a home we won and they're probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

767
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because probably lots of homely girls</v>

768
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 4>that are applying for these jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not getting hired.</v>

769
00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:46.751
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

770
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100% but there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating thing that's going on today</v>

771
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:54.140
<v Speaker 3>where our competition is thought to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in somehow some way,</v>

772
00:30:54.141 --> 00:30:57.740
<v Speaker 3>shape or form a negative thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that this kind of competition,</v>

773
00:30:57.741 --> 00:31:00.890
<v Speaker 3>whether it's co,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even capitalism itself is criticized,</v>

774
00:31:00.891 --> 00:31:02.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people today that</v>

775
00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:06.020
<v Speaker 3>are in favor of socialism and it's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why Bernie Sanders was so</v>

776
00:31:06.021 --> 00:31:07.970
<v Speaker 3>attractive is because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

777
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.060
<v Speaker 3>you people that are not winning this</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy competition out there that don't</v>

778
00:31:11.061 --> 00:31:13.400
<v Speaker 3>have any desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to even out this playing</v>

779
00:31:13.401 --> 00:31:14.690
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those people that are out there</v>

780
00:31:14.691 --> 00:31:17.780
<v Speaker 3>kicking ass and taking names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to take some of that money</v>

781
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.670
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to just give it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>

782
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the appeal of socialism because</v>

783
00:31:22.051 --> 00:31:24.120
<v Speaker 4>it appeals to the lowest common</v>
<v Speaker 4>denominator.</v>

784
00:31:24.121 --> 00:31:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Downloads his appeal to ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it appeals to greed because an envy</v>

785
00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:28.561
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

786
00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:31.350
<v Speaker 4>this person has so much more than me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not fair.</v>

787
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.500
<v Speaker 4>But here's the beauty of competition</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is why we want competition.</v>

788
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.800
<v Speaker 4>We all want stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

789
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.570
<v Speaker 4>And and so I want people competing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sell me stuff,</v>

790
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to have as much as I can as far</v>

791
00:31:46.081 --> 00:31:47.820
<v Speaker 4>as consumer goods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we all want.</v>

792
00:31:47.821 --> 00:31:52.821
<v Speaker 4>We want products and services that</v>
<v Speaker 4>enhance our lives and the way we get the</v>

793
00:31:53.371 --> 00:31:57.510
<v Speaker 4>best products with the highest quality</v>
<v Speaker 4>that deliver the most value at the</v>

794
00:31:57.511 --> 00:32:00.510
<v Speaker 4>lowest price is to have lots of</v>
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>

795
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.750
<v Speaker 4>All kinds of people competing for my</v>
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>

796
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got some money to spend.</v>

797
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy my product,</v>

798
00:32:06.361 --> 00:32:09.210
<v Speaker 4>buy my product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Competition is what's made is what makes</v>

799
00:32:09.211 --> 00:32:11.010
<v Speaker 4>sure that I get the best thing.</v>

800
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go back to the old Soviet Union and</v>

801
00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:14.311
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

802
00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:18.390
<v Speaker 4>there was no competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you wanted a phone in the</v>

803
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union in the 1960s.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you went on a waiting list and</v>

804
00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:24.150
<v Speaker 4>maybe three or four years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were lucky enough you had the</v>

805
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.880
<v Speaker 4>right connections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody gave you this big fat black</v>

806
00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:27.930
<v Speaker 4>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.790
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you had one phone and it was very</v>

808
00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:30.870
<v Speaker 4>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

809
00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:34.050
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's phones under co under capitalism.</v>

810
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Look at the phones we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a fallen and I could take movies</v>

811
00:32:36.781 --> 00:32:37.680
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a kit.</v>

812
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a camera.</v>

813
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>I used</v>

814
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 2>it to get here with its GPS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

815
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:44.780
<v Speaker 2>do you think I would have a phone like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this if the government was,</v>

816
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.650
<v Speaker 2>had a monopoly on phones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

817
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 2>I had a by any government phone that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to put in my place.</v>

818
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 2>So we all to say the competition isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

819
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 2>All the things that we value wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist if people weren't competing with</v>

820
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:56.241
<v Speaker 2>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

821
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:56.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

822
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer in competition,</v>

823
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:03.401
<v Speaker 2>but one of the weird arguments is</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening now is that competition is bad</v>

824
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:06.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's a very blinders argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

825
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I saw you battle against that argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were with occupy Wall Street,</v>

826
00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:12.620
<v Speaker 2>when you went down to the park and talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>to those people.</v>

827
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:14.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of these very aggressive,</v>

828
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 2>very passionate people with a limited</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of understanding about capitalism</v>

829
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had no underst hilarious.</v>

830
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a wonderful exposing,</v>

831
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.550
<v Speaker 2>but they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was weird,</v>

832
00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:25.851
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

833
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 2>they were in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have signs,</v>

834
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 2>they're screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're yelling,</v>

835
00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 2>they're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet,</v>

836
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:31.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

837
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.870
<v Speaker 2>is very little understanding of what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that they're rallying against.</v>

838
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.830
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I went there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you haven't seen it,</v>

839
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.930
<v Speaker 2>you're plenty of youtube videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The law there,</v>

840
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:40.610
<v Speaker 2>there's one that's like two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

841
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole,</v>

842
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I talked until we ran out of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

843
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I seen about 10 videos of you</v>

844
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 2>talking to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody just recently resurrected.</v>

845
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a copy of it and got another two</v>

846
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 2>and a half million views just a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>

847
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:55.390
<v Speaker 2>So I know people are watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

848
00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.400
<v Speaker 2>I went down there because I sympathized</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that people are upset and,</v>

849
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 2>and that I know that the economy is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as productive as it should be.</v>

850
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have jobs that should have jobs.</v>

851
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that we should have a much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>vibrant economy.</v>

852
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.640
<v Speaker 2>We should have a much higher standard of</v>
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

853
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.970
<v Speaker 2>There should be a lot more opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not because we don't have</v>

854
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 2>enough government is because we have too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

855
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's the problems that we have on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street.</v>

856
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 2>We're not a function of capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a function of the government's</v>

857
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 2>failure to allow capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that I was predicting the</v>

858
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 2>2008 financial crisis and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling me doctor doom.</v>

859
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 2>The reason I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew about the housing bubble in</v>

860
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 2>advance and I was able to see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis coming was because I</v>

861
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 2>understood the dynamics at play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understood how the government,</v>

862
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 2>how the Federal Reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how their policies we're working to</v>

863
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 2>inflate these bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understood the moral hazards and</v>

864
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of what was going on.</v>

865
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And so when I went down as a Cottey</v>
<v Speaker 2>Park,</v>

866
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.610
<v Speaker 2>the point I was trying to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even so much the people that</v>

867
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:58.730
<v Speaker 2>were protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the people who I knew would watch</v>

868
00:34:58.731 --> 00:35:02.840
<v Speaker 2>the interaction all around the world was</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the point that you are right to</v>

869
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:03.890
<v Speaker 2>be upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

870
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.371
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

871
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 2>you're venting your anger in the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

872
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 2>They're inventing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're angry or people at you like you</v>

873
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.860
<v Speaker 2>and a successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quote unquote one 1% capitalism.</v>

874
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

875
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 2>it's the Federal Reserve that is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>source of your problems.</v>

876
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 2>It's congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the White House.</v>

877
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not the financial district in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York City.</v>

878
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean the free market people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>free market are there to help you write</v>

879
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.890
<v Speaker 2>anyone in anyone that has a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they're trying to do is win your</v>

880
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:35.090
<v Speaker 2>business as a customer there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're competing to get you to buy</v>

881
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 2>things and anything that you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

882
00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 2>If choose to buy something,</v>

883
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:42.420
<v Speaker 4>if I buy something for 20 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I must value what I'm buying more than</v>

884
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 4>20 bucks or I wouldn't make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange.</v>

885
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 4>So to the extent that there's a business</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there trying to convince me to buy</v>

886
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 4>something that I value more than money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to hurt me.</v>

887
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.400
<v Speaker 4>The problem is government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Government has power,</v>

888
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 4>government has brute force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government can force me to do things</v>

889
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Speaker 4>that I don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government can make my life worse.</v>

890
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 4>A private business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just going to make my life better,</v>

891
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if they're not going to make my</v>

892
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 4>life better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do business with them.</v>

893
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 4>But the government is a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can pass laws,</v>

894
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 4>they can pass taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can best regulations.</v>

895
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 4>And as it so happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the laws and regulations that they're</v>

896
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 4>passing are making people's lives worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

897
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 4>the problem wasn't that big banks</v>
<v Speaker 4>failed.</v>

898
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.900
<v Speaker 4>The problem was that they got bailed</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

899
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 4>Don't blame the banks for accepting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bail out.</v>

900
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you do if someone offered to</v>

901
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:27.121
<v Speaker 4>bail you out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

902
00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:29.820
<v Speaker 4>you'd take the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is the government,</v>

903
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:32.910
<v Speaker 4>the government shouldn't have had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>power to bail him out in the first place</v>

904
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 4>so that the real enemy is government and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the power that government has.</v>

905
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:39.840
<v Speaker 4>We have to take that power away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

906
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 4>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you take power away from</v>

907
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you create freedom,</v>

908
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what freedom is.</v>

909
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 4>It's absence of government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

910
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you say the Federal Reserve and</v>

911
00:36:47.521 --> 00:36:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Congress or the real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is their incentive to be that</v>

912
00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 4>issue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is their incentive to not allow the</v>

913
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 4>market to thrive and to like you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying that they're the reason why there</v>

914
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 4>aren't more opportunities and there</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't more people working?</v>

915
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

916
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.970
<v Speaker 4>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

917
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 4>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do they have to gain?</v>

918
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.911
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul,</v>

919
00:37:06.911 --> 00:37:09.060
<v Speaker 4>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politicians have power,</v>

920
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want the money to get elected and</v>

921
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 4>they want all the perks that come with</v>
<v Speaker 4>elected office.</v>

922
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people that are in government live</v>

923
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 4>pretty good lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason to do it right.</v>

924
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:21.780
<v Speaker 4>It's not that they want to serve the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will help the people.</v>

925
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 4>They want a personal benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

926
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all it,</v>

927
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 4>that's all the nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

928
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 4>They all pretend that they're public</v>
<v Speaker 4>servants,</v>

929
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:28.051
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

930
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 4>that's that Spiel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

931
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:30.250
<v Speaker 4>That they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all there.</v>

932
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.290
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're acting.</v>

933
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.110
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're playing a part that's a,</v>

934
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 4>that's a means to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want the power.</v>

935
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 4>They want the perks that come with</v>
<v Speaker 4>elected office.</v>

936
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 4>And so obviously in order to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>elected,</v>

937
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:44.670
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get the votes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to get the contributions.</v>

938
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 4>And so they're not making policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good economics.</v>

939
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.290
<v Speaker 4>All they're trying to do is get elected</v>
<v Speaker 4>and get donations.</v>

940
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 4>And so they have a vested interest in</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping the people that give them money.</v>

941
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.180
<v Speaker 4>And people are always trying to buy</v>
<v Speaker 4>special perks from government,</v>

942
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tax break or you know,</v>

943
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.263
<v Speaker 4>put these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

944
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.870
<v Speaker 4>regulate my competitor instead of me or</v>
<v Speaker 4>put this guy out of business.</v>

945
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.600
<v Speaker 4>And of course a lot of people just vote</v>
<v Speaker 4>for something for free.</v>

946
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 4>That was the power of Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you free stuff,</v>

947
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both from me.</v>

948
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.400
<v Speaker 4>And there are a lot of people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know any better and they're just going</v>

949
00:38:16.401 --> 00:38:18.540
<v Speaker 4>to vote for whoever it promises the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>free stuff.</v>

950
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 4>But free stuff isn't free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very expensive.</v>

951
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 4>But what it really amounts to is theft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

952
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 4>the liberal say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vote for me and I'm going to steal from</v>

953
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 4>somebody else and give you what I take</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the government doesn't have</v>

954
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 4>anything the government doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

955
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:34.680
<v Speaker 4>if they're going to promise something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to take it from somebody else.</v>

956
00:38:34.681 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Government</v>

957
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 2>doesn't produce government just</v>
<v Speaker 2>redistributes what other people produce.</v>

958
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's always a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whenever the government does that,</v>

959
00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 2>when they taxed the productive people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give money to nonproductive people,</v>

960
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 2>they increased the incentive not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce.</v>

961
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 2>And they decrease the incentive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce.</v>

962
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 2>So all this redistribution of wealth</v>
<v Speaker 2>just means that there's a lot less</v>

963
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:57.880
<v Speaker 2>wealth to redistribute and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>ends up poor.</v>

964
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 2>If the politicians stayed out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'd have a lot more wealth and</v>

965
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 2>everybody would be better off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not,</v>

966
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:06.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politics of it are the things that</v>

967
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 2>are good economics are bad politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

968
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 2>like take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

969
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>

970
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't the Republicans Repeal</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare,</v>

971
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because obamacare is terrible economics.</v>

972
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it terribly economics.</v>

973
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.280
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get into this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last time you were here.</v>

974
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got sidetracked.</v>

975
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.570
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is terrible about it?</v>

976
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

977
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean we could spend the whole show on</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it's bad economics,</v>

978
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a belief out there that</v>

979
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.580
<v Speaker 2>government is somehow going to be a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient provider of health care than</v>

980
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>the free market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just not true.</v>

981
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.273
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

982
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.950
<v Speaker 2>healthcare is a surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

983
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Just like food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like shelter,</v>

984
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:51.610
<v Speaker 2>just like clothing and the free market</v>
<v Speaker 2>can provide it better and cheaper than</v>

985
00:39:51.611 --> 00:39:52.301
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

986
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 2>that's just always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people like it as a service.</v>

987
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.170
<v Speaker 3>So that becomes a part of what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government offers you along with,</v>

988
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you pay your taxes,</v>

989
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:02.710
<v Speaker 3>they fixed the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hire the police,</v>

990
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would like healthcare to be along</v>

991
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 3>that line as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like it is in the UK and in Canada</v>

992
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.070
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

993
00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.940
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in some ways those systems are</v>

994
00:40:12.941 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 2>better than the system we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not better than the system</v>

995
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:21.400
<v Speaker 2>we used to have or better than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that we could have if it was a</v>

996
00:40:21.401 --> 00:40:22.600
<v Speaker 2>pure free market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

997
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.460
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

998
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.110
<v Speaker 2>there's two things you got right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got healthcare and then you've</v>

999
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 2>got the health insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1000
00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two industries separately because</v>

1001
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.100
<v Speaker 2>the reason that people buy health</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>

1002
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in case,</v>

1003
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I get really sick,</v>

1004
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford the bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1005
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.240
<v Speaker 2>people buy car insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1007
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.770
<v Speaker 2>When you buy car insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that you still have to pay for</v>

1008
00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 2>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1009
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:49.060
<v Speaker 2>you don't expect your car insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy to cover the cost of gas.</v>

1010
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't cover the cost of new tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't cover the cost of a new spark</v>

1011
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>plugs or your routine maintenance.</v>

1012
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.020
<v Speaker 2>The reason you buy auto insurances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1013
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:01.720
<v Speaker 2>what if I get into a wreck and I total</v>
<v Speaker 2>my car,</v>

1014
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the cash to buy a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people buy insurance because they're</v>

1015
00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:09.880
<v Speaker 2>insuring against something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not going to happen,</v>

1016
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you buy your auto insurance,</v>

1017
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 2>the anticipation is that you never put</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a claim and you're happy to never put</v>

1018
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 2>into a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the insurance company,</v>

1019
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 2>obviously it doesn't want you to put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a claim.</v>

1020
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 2>They're hoping that they collect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>premiums.</v>

1021
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And the way auto insurance works is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because most people don't put in a claim</v>

1022
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.050
<v Speaker 2>because they don't get into an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The insurance company has the money to</v>

1023
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 2>pay the people who do get an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1024
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's how insurance works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of the government health</v>

1025
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 2>insurance then work that way anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1026
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Because of the government and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government's set up the system where if</v>

1027
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:45.881
<v Speaker 2>I hire somebody and I pay them cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to pay income taxes on it.</v>

1028
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.940
<v Speaker 2>If I give them health insurance instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cash,</v>

1029
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 2>it's tax free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people all of a sudden</v>

1030
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.310
<v Speaker 2>wanted health insurance instead of cash</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't have to pay tax on</v>

1031
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 2>health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now more and more people started to</v>

1032
00:42:01.281 --> 00:42:06.281
<v Speaker 2>want their health insurance to cover the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of more gas in my car or a</v>

1033
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 2>flat tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the minute you try to pay for your</v>

1034
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:15.710
<v Speaker 2>routine medical costs with a third party</v>
<v Speaker 2>payer through health insurance,</v>

1035
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you have these spiraling out of control</v>
<v Speaker 2>costs.</v>

1036
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you never,</v>

1037
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 2>if you pulled up to a gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't actually pay for the gas.</v>

1038
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.550
<v Speaker 2>You just like put your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your gas,</v>

1039
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>your credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a insurance card into the pump</v>

1040
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't even have prices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you go to the doctor,</v>

1041
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what things cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no prices.</v>

1042
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to buy gas,</v>

1043
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 2>everybody has the price right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I look around and if one place is 2</v>

1044
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 2>cents cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I'm going.</v>

1045
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:40.214
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1046
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the gas stations didn't even bother</v>

1047
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:43.550
<v Speaker 2>to put the price,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

1048
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:45.980
<v Speaker 2>what do you care what the gas costs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The insurance companies paid for it,</v>

1049
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1050
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:48.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what we have with the healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1051
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.370
<v Speaker 2>We have a system that government created</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people rely on health insurance to</v>

1052
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 2>pay for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Health insurance should just be for very</v>

1053
00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 2>expensive things that are probably not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen to you,</v>

1054
00:42:59.121 --> 00:42:59.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1055
00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I get hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get cancer.</v>

1056
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.640
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't use your health insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you go to the doctor.</v>

1057
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 2>And if we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we got people to pay for their health</v>

1058
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:09.710
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they pay for their,</v>

1059
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.510
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their auto insurance or the life</v>

1060
00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:13.910
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we separate health insurance from</v>

1061
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:16.670
<v Speaker 2>employment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health insurance will be much cheaper.</v>

1062
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the government that married the</v>

1063
00:43:19.011 --> 00:43:19.844
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1064
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's why people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1065
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 2>if you lose your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose your healthcare.</v>

1066
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 2>That's because the government fix the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax code.</v>

1067
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1068
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you don't lose your auto insurance when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose your job.</v>

1069
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.900
<v Speaker 2>But the other important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's why obamacare doesn't work.</v>

1070
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 2>See the thesis of Obamacare was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1071
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.440
<v Speaker 2>let's make it so that insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies can't discriminate against</v>

1072
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 2>people that have a preexisting</v>
<v Speaker 2>condition,</v>

1073
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can't charge people more money</v>

1074
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 2>just because they happen to be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1075
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.750
<v Speaker 2>This was one of the appeals of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1076
00:43:50.751 --> 00:43:54.110
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason people buy insurance</v>

1077
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.190
<v Speaker 2>when they're healthy health insurance is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know they can't buy it when</v>

1078
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Speaker 2>they're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say with the auto insurance,</v>

1079
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 2>if there was a law that said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or auto insurance companies couldn't</v>

1080
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 2>discriminate based on preexisting</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

1081
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.840
<v Speaker 2>If you can buy the policy after your</v>
<v Speaker 2>accident and get coverage for the same</v>

1082
00:44:11.841 --> 00:44:14.090
<v Speaker 2>price as if you bought it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1083
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would buy auto insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just wait until you had an</v>

1084
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:18.344
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

1085
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Auto Insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a weird argument because auto insurance</v>

1086
00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:23.810
<v Speaker 3>is mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to have it where health</v>

1087
00:44:23.811 --> 00:44:27.080
<v Speaker 3>insurance not mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's obamacare kind of makes it</v>

1088
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:27.950
<v Speaker 3>mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1089
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 3>You're just saying it's mentoring for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong aspects of Eve insurance that</v>

1090
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>it covers the wrong things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well even look,</v>

1091
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:37.220
<v Speaker 2>fire insurance isn't mandatory either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1092
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Insurance is in certain states it is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not all coverages mandatory</v>

1093
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and you know you haven't pulsory</v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage.</v>

1094
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 2>You have to have some which is similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what you're talking about with health</v>

1095
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compulsory health insurance,</v>

1096
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:51.120
<v Speaker 2>like for catastrophic injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they made it,</v>

1097
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:56.150
<v Speaker 2>they obamacare made it compulsory gives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is this that if auto insurance</v>

1098
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.430
<v Speaker 2>was not compulsory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and you can just decide whether or</v>

1099
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:03.090
<v Speaker 2>not you wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was a law that said that</v>

1100
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminate,</v>

1101
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.380
<v Speaker 2>nobody would buy it because you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wait until after you had an</v>

1102
00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is not just that.</v>

1103
00:45:09.121 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Well the reason why auto insurance is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad example is because you are going to</v>

1104
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:13.950
<v Speaker 2>hit my car and you going to do damage to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1105
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Have you have no insurance on your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be you run into you on</v>

1106
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 2>the street and collide with my body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt you.</v>

1107
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I somehow now I don't have health</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance and so you get injured from</v>

1108
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:25.141
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

1109
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 2>just don't you think that's a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument rather than even make that</v>

1110
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:29.580
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just go to fire insurance cause</v>

1111
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:32.400
<v Speaker 2>there's only one person involved me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a house.</v>

1112
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would I buy fire insurance if I can go</v>

1113
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 2>to an insurance company after my house</v>
<v Speaker 2>already burns down and by the policy for</v>

1114
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 2>the same price?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason that people buy fire</v>

1115
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 2>insurance policies before their house</v>
<v Speaker 2>burns down is because they know that</v>

1116
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 2>nobody will sell them a policy after it</v>
<v Speaker 2>burns down.</v>

1117
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.990
<v Speaker 2>And the insurance companies couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in business if the only people who</v>

1118
00:45:52.991 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 2>were buying policies where people whose</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses already burnt down.</v>

1119
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happened with obamacare.</v>

1120
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.280
<v Speaker 2>So Obama says we're gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So insurance companies can't</v>

1121
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:03.780
<v Speaker 2>discriminate against people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

1122
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the result of that is no healthy</v>

1123
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:08.130
<v Speaker 2>person's going to want to buy insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of money.</v>

1124
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Why pay premiums when you're not sick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait until you get sick.</v>

1125
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 2>So what am I can't discriminate against</v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you have a preexisting</v>

1126
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way Obama tried to combat that</v>

1127
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1128
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.150
<v Speaker 2>we're going to force people to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>

1129
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to require employers to</v>

1130
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 2>provide it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you know you don't get it from</v>

1131
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 2>your employer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to find you.</v>

1132
00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a penalty if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't buy the insurance right now.</v>

1133
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Two things about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1134
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 2>the penalties were too low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Because the penalty for not buying</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance is so cheap that it's cheaper</v>

1136
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Speaker 2>to not buy insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay the penalty,</v>

1137
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 2>and then wait until you get sick to by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the insurance.</v>

1138
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.510
<v Speaker 2>That's why the insurance companies are</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing all this money,</v>

1139
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.870
<v Speaker 2>and that's why premiums are skyrocketing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody wants to buy because the</v>

1140
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 2>punished if the penalties were too low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But politically,</v>

1141
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.600
<v Speaker 2>everybody likes the idea that insurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies can't discriminate based on</v>

1142
00:46:57.601 --> 00:47:00.300
<v Speaker 2>preclinical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the Republicans tried to do was</v>

1143
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 2>have their cake and eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said to the voters,</v>

1144
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 2>we're going to keep the ban on</v>
<v Speaker 2>preexisting conditions,</v>

1145
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to get rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mandates.</v>

1146
00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:10.380
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get rid of the penalties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get rid of this.</v>

1147
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have both.</v>

1148
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 2>The real problem was the taxes were too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the penalties were too low.</v>

1149
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 2>They needed the jack those penalties up</v>
<v Speaker 2>because so many people were paying the</v>

1150
00:47:19.951 --> 00:47:24.510
<v Speaker 2>penalty and not buying the insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is we need a free market</v>

1151
00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:28.290
<v Speaker 2>insurance because the Republicans want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say you should be able to buy the</v>

1152
00:47:28.291 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>type of coverage that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be</v>

1153
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 4>able to buy the kind of inch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is true,</v>

1154
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.630
<v Speaker 4>but then insurance companies have to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to deny you coverage.</v>

1155
00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 4>If they don't want to cover you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to be able to charge you more</v>

1156
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 4>if you're already sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the only way to have inexpensive</v>

1157
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:46.201
<v Speaker 4>insurance is for the insurance companies</v>
<v Speaker 4>to discriminate and to charge people</v>

1158
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.020
<v Speaker 4>more money if they're already sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's because of that.</v>

1159
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 4>That's why healthy people buy policies</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they know,</v>

1160
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.180
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me buy it now why I'm healthy,</v>

1161
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.910
<v Speaker 4>because if I happen to get sick and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be a lot more expensive.</v>

1162
00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 4>So what the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the government is trying to do is</v>

1163
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:02.530
<v Speaker 4>just trying to destroy the market for</v>
<v Speaker 4>health insurance.</v>

1164
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the costs are skyrocketing,</v>

1165
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 4>insurance is getting more expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Healthcare is getting more expensive.</v>

1166
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to the days before the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government was involved,</v>

1167
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare was not a problem.</v>

1168
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1169
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 4>in the 1920s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1930 [inaudible] 1940 [inaudible] 1950s,</v>

1170
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:23.710
<v Speaker 4>healthcare was not expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People didn't worry about medical bills.</v>

1171
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 4>They were not high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you needed a catastrophic insurance,</v>

1172
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 4>it was inexpensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to go to the doctor,</v>

1173
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1174
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:34.450
<v Speaker 4>people didn't even worry about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was cool or is quality care</v>

1175
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.280
<v Speaker 4>and it was at a low cost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with all the advancements that we've</v>

1176
00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 4>had in medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all the technology,</v>

1177
00:48:42.131 --> 00:48:47.131
<v Speaker 4>with all the drugs that are here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare should be cheaper today than</v>

1178
00:48:47.381 --> 00:48:49.820
<v Speaker 4>it was in 1940 [inaudible] and 1950s on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1179
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.400
<v Speaker 4>on a real basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1180
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 4>and I hear all the time people make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>

1181
00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that healthcare is more</v>

1182
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 4>expensive because it's more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 4>now because we do all these things that</v>

1183
00:48:59.441 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 4>we didn't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that were true,</v>

1184
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 4>then why isn't my cell phone today more</v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive than a cell phone 10 or 20</v>

1185
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:07.054
<v Speaker 4>years ago?</v>

1186
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.640
<v Speaker 4>Is it as does more expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1187
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:12.360
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly ends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just you get subsidized by your,</v>

1188
00:49:12.361 --> 00:49:13.860
<v Speaker 4>your company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter who you are,</v>

1189
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 4>the they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they drag out the payments.</v>

1190
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 4>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you buy a cell phone from verizon,</v>

1191
00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.030
<v Speaker 4>they're not selling you the full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you buy an iphone seven they're</v>

1192
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 4>not selling it to you at the full rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The full rate would be like 1,012</v>

1193
00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:25.901
<v Speaker 4>hundred bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1194
00:49:25.901 --> 00:49:30.901
<v Speaker 4>But I paid $1,000 in the 1980s for my</v>
<v Speaker 4>first cell phone that didn't do jack</v>

1195
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.760
<v Speaker 4>compared with this very early days of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon Gekko ones.</v>

1196
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 4>I've got this Mac Mac book air in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of me here.</v>

1197
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:42.900
<v Speaker 4>And so this back book air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously this is a a,</v>

1198
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cost me like 12 1400 bucks.</v>

1199
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 4>My first computer that I had in college</v>
<v Speaker 4>was an apple,</v>

1200
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:53.431
<v Speaker 4>two e and that computer and I got a dot</v>
<v Speaker 4>matrix printer and I had a floppy disk</v>

1201
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.920
<v Speaker 4>and my dad spent almost $5,000 on it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>1981 and all it was was a glorified word</v>

1202
00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 4>processor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1203
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:05.230
<v Speaker 4>So obviously the power in this computer</v>
<v Speaker 4>is so much greater than the one that I</v>

1204
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 4>had in that apple two e yet it's less</v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive.</v>

1205
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Even forgetting about adjusting for</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflation,</v>

1206
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.110
<v Speaker 4>it's actually cheaper in actual dollars</v>
<v Speaker 4>and did,</v>

1207
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that it's more</v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated.</v>

1208
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 4>And my point is that just because</v>
<v Speaker 4>something is more complicated and more</v>

1209
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean it's going to be more</v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive.</v>

1210
00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Healthcare today should be cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of this,</v>

1211
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 4>all of the new technology be bringing</v>
<v Speaker 4>down</v>

1212
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 2>the cost of medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason it's not is because of</v>

1213
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 2>government's involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if government was involved in the</v>

1214
00:50:33.651 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 2>computer industry the same way it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in healthcare,</v>

1215
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.130
<v Speaker 2>then we would see skyrocketing computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>prices that,</v>

1216
00:50:39.131 --> 00:50:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1217
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:43.040
<v Speaker 2>so now why does the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're saying that the government</v>

1218
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 2>wants to destroy the insurance industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't want to,</v>

1219
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.150
<v Speaker 2>not adroit as troy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

1220
00:50:49.151 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 2>why do they want to complicate it the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I do think?</v>

1221
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:51.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1222
00:50:51.831 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're smart enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy it on purpose.</v>

1223
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the unintended consequences.</v>

1224
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to get votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get elected.</v>

1225
00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.113
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1226
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 2>people want something for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So number one,</v>

1227
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of votes by promising free</v>

1228
00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.570
<v Speaker 2>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1229
00:51:05.571 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 2>So number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also why do the insurance companies,</v>

1230
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 2>because there are massive subsidies for</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies,</v>

1231
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:11.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1232
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>If I can get the government to require</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to buy my product,</v>

1233
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 2>then I don't have to offer a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>

1234
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1235
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 2>when she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you like to government to</v>

1236
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 2>require everybody to listen to the Joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan podcast?</v>

1237
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 2>If that was mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super furious at me.</v>

1238
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the way it is,</v>

1239
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.290
<v Speaker 2>but although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1240
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of businesses rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>than having to win.</v>

1241
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe if you had a lousy podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody listened to,</v>

1242
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.440
<v Speaker 2>you'd want the government to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1243
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:36.170
<v Speaker 2>too many people are listening to Joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan forced them to listen to my</v>

1244
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 2>podcast instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1245
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:39.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these big healthcare companies</v>

1246
00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 2>or insurance companies that want</v>
<v Speaker 2>something from government.</v>

1247
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 2>They want the government to mandate</v>
<v Speaker 2>people buy their product or protect them</v>

1248
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:46.910
<v Speaker 2>from competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1249
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to buy an insurance policy</v>

1250
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.010
<v Speaker 2>from a Japanese company or a Swiss</v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

1251
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it.</v>

1252
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.490
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some Swiss company can't come over here</v>

1253
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 2>to California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>

1254
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 2>they won't even let companies from other</v>
<v Speaker 2>states sell you policies.</v>

1255
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>

1256
00:52:00.171 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 2>We need more competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But government is protecting companies</v>

1257
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.400
<v Speaker 2>from having to compete with one another</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't have to do as good a job.</v>

1258
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 2>But Obama was already in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when he was trying to do this.</v>

1259
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the incentive for trying to</v>

1260
00:52:12.891 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 2>pass this once he's already an office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wants to get reelected,</v>

1261
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 2>which he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did get reelected,</v>

1262
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of political pay off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

1263
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:23.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay off the people that help put you in</v>

1264
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:27.050
<v Speaker 2>office and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to help other Democrats get</v>

1265
00:52:27.051 --> 00:52:27.801
<v Speaker 2>elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
00:52:27.801 --> 00:52:28.051
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1267
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 2>and maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain that power.</v>

1268
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 2>But nobody ever debate this with him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of a rational,</v>

1269
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:34.730
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic way.</v>

1270
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 2>The way you're laying it out right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1271
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't know when it comes to a</v>

1272
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:40.820
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know if they're doing stupid</v>

1273
00:52:40.821 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 2>things because they're stupid or because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care that they're done.</v>

1274
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:49.110
<v Speaker 2>They're just the ramifications of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to propose and why,</v>

1275
00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either either that people believe in</v>

1276
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 2>liberal philosophy or these programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either because they're ignorant or</v>

1277
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 2>because they have an ulterior motive</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

1278
00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.880
<v Speaker 2>There are probably some politicians</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that are actually dumb enough to</v>

1279
00:53:01.881 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 2>think that this is a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1280
00:53:03.381 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Like we talked about the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some people that actually</v>

1281
00:53:06.411 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 2>believe that it's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1282
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.860
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how bad it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it because they're,</v>

1283
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking with their hearts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not with their heads,</v>

1284
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 2>but there are probably some people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>support the minimum wage knowing that</v>

1285
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 2>it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they know it's good politics or</v>

1286
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:24.200
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid to come out against it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's such bad politics.</v>

1287
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 2>So you don't for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody is in favor of something,</v>

1288
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 2>do they actually realize how bad it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1289
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they just dumb enough to actually</v>

1290
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 2>believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say if you adjust for</v>

1291
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 2>inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably right about cell phones.</v>

1292
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.420
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking now like a Motorola</v>
<v Speaker 2>startac.</v>

1293
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much were those?</v>

1294
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Those were expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much were they when they came out?</v>

1295
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I think there were like five or 600</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks,</v>

1296
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 2>but if you adjust for inflation about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much it costs to use them,</v>

1297
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 2>that's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The roaming costs were extraordinary,</v>

1298
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 2>but even if you didn't roam I distance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and long distance.</v>

1299
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 2>My first plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I was in,</v>

1300
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I had my first phone and I think it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 70 80 bucks a month.</v>

1301
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 2>And I had like a half hour of talk time.</v>

1302
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.561
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would,</v>

1303
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 2>if someone called me on my cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was quick because I had to quickly get</v>

1304
00:54:07.741 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 2>off because if you went over your</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1305
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I have unlimited,</v>

1306
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 2>not only is it unlimited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk,</v>

1307
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see people,</v>

1308
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I see their faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could talk to people in other</v>

1309
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's companies that are offering</v>

1310
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.060
<v Speaker 2>unlimited data too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just cause there,</v>

1311
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 2>because we didn't even have database</v>
<v Speaker 2>keating.</v>

1312
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there can be,</v>

1313
00:54:24.371 --> 00:54:26.220
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 1000 bucks.</v>

1314
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:27.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so wrong.</v>

1315
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you adjust for inflation.</v>

1316
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just reinflation of a startac</v>

1317
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a piece of shit comparatively.</v>

1318
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the battery lasted like a half an</v>

1319
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.440
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes of,</v>

1320
00:54:40.441 --> 00:54:42.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so a brand new iphone,</v>

1321
00:54:42.871 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>it's probably like 1200 so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you adjust for inflation.</v>

1322
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:46.824
<v Speaker 2>You right?</v>

1323
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about Bernie Sanders</v>

1324
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.250
<v Speaker 2>and you're talking about some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>policies that that guy was proposing and</v>

1325
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:54.690
<v Speaker 2>some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of,</v>

1326
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin hooding the whole deal taking from</v>

1327
00:54:57.001 --> 00:55:01.140
<v Speaker 2>the rich and giving to the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's extremely appealing to people,</v>

1328
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

1329
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:07.470
<v Speaker 2>how do you lay it out to people in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can understand that although</v>

1330
00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:11.550
<v Speaker 2>this looks like a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is not a good idea and</v>

1331
00:55:11.551 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 2>ultimately it's not going to benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1332
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.830
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make things stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna make things harder for</v>

1333
00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 2>business and it's gonna make things</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder for jobs.</v>

1334
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.960
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people listening right now to</v>
<v Speaker 2>even me saying that they're tweeting me</v>

1335
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 2>to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking a shill.</v>

1336
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 2>You sell out you 1% or you piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1337
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thought process between Eh,</v>

1338
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:34.100
<v Speaker 2>behind anybody who says anything even</v>
<v Speaker 2>remotely negative about socialism,</v>

1339
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 2>that you have to be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sellout or you just want to keep things</v>

1340
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 2>the way they are so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>

1341
00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing that so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>find socialism appealing.</v>

1342
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Yet they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1343
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascism is really bad.</v>

1344
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nazis were really bad.</v>

1345
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize that the Nazi party</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stands for national socialism,</v>

1346
00:55:52.081 --> 00:55:54.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's national social.</v>

1347
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 2>So socialism is a broader economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory that encompasses cat,</v>

1348
00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:00.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communism and fascism.</v>

1349
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.490
<v Speaker 2>They're both forms of socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1350
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:03.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1351
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:04.650
<v Speaker 2>it's all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1352
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 2>And the whole idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1353
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:08.200
<v Speaker 2>all the whole premise of socialism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1354
00:56:08.201 --> 00:56:08.870
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1355
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:11.760
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free market being a libertarian is</v>

1356
00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:15.060
<v Speaker 2>all about the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about freedom and,</v>

1357
00:56:15.061 --> 00:56:15.471
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1358
00:56:15.471 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 2>and recognizing the value of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the individual and their rights to</v>

1359
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 2>pursue their own self interest or own</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness property.</v>

1360
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:25.180
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your question,</v>

1361
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:29.680
<v Speaker 2>how do you talk to people and get them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see how bad socialism is?</v>

1362
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:30.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1363
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1364
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 2>look at the countries that have tried it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in its extreme form,</v>

1365
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1366
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Whether it was like the Soviet Union or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a North Korea or Cuba or East Germany,</v>

1367
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you could look at examples where you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>people moving in this direction.</v>

1368
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 2>These promises of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1369
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:49.150
<v Speaker 2>from each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to his ability to each</v>

1370
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:51.100
<v Speaker 2>according to his need and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

1371
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:56.170
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like we don't have a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of failed socialist experiments.</v>

1372
00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the countries that are</v>

1373
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 2>the most prosperous and those are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that have the least amount of</v>

1374
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 2>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1375
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1376
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 2>socialism is going to exist in a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

1377
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:11.500
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find any place on the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>now where there isn't some elements of</v>

1378
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 2>socialism that have crept into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

1379
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:18.620
<v Speaker 2>But the extent that countries have</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to limit the amount of socialist</v>

1380
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.760
<v Speaker 2>policies they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have maximized the standard of</v>

1381
00:57:21.761 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 2>living of their people.</v>

1382
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So the more like look at Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1383
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:25.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1384
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

1385
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:28.920
<v Speaker 2>and president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1386
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:30.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1387
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was tweeting out not too long ago.</v>

1388
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:33.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's upset that they don't have enough</v>

1390
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need more democracy.</v>

1391
00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:39.400
<v Speaker 2>They don't need more democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democracy is what got them into trouble</v>

1392
00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:42.970
<v Speaker 2>because they voted for socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they need in Venezuela is more</v>

1393
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need more freedom,</v>

1394
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.590
<v Speaker 2>not just more people voting for other</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialists.</v>

1395
00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Notice of the appeal of socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially the same appeal of turning</v>

1396
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico into a state that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get something for it.</v>

1397
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:56.050
<v Speaker 2>It's going to benefit the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1398
00:57:56.051 --> 00:57:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1399
00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of getting something for</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1400
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a certain,</v>

1401
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 2>if you think of that superficially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you know there's an old</v>

1402
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 2>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1403
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 2>If you're not socialists by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 20 you don't have a heart.</v>

1404
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:11.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're 30 you don't have a</v>

1405
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because people are caring.</v>

1406
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

1407
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:17.620
<v Speaker 2>most people care about their fellow</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

1408
00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:19.690
<v Speaker 2>including conservatives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians.</v>

1409
00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean they care to just at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of liberals think that</v>

1410
00:58:22.841 --> 00:58:26.140
<v Speaker 2>conservatives are mean because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't support these programs.</v>

1411
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not because they're mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that they recognize the</v>

1412
00:58:29.021 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>unintended consequences of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs,</v>

1413
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 2>that the programs actually make it worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the people that you're trying to</v>

1414
00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:36.220
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But younger people who don't have as</v>

1415
00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 2>much real world experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know any better.</v>

1416
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:43.501
<v Speaker 2>So it's very easy to be a socialist when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 16 1718 you'd never had a job.</v>

1417
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.090
<v Speaker 2>You've never run a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have much real world</v>

1418
00:58:46.091 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're carrying human being.</v>

1419
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.270
<v Speaker 2>So I don't fault young people for being</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialists,</v>

1420
00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you get to your thirties and</v>

1421
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>your forties and you haven't grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that's like a little kid still</v>

1422
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 2>believing in Santa Claus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1423
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.850
<v Speaker 2>How come you didn't learn anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1424
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Here's Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1425
00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:04.310
<v Speaker 2>you know what is he 70 something years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old and he's,</v>

1426
00:59:04.311 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 2>he thinks like as a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he didn't learn anything from all</v>

1427
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:08.320
<v Speaker 2>this life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1428
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:08.971
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he it,</v>

1429
00:59:08.971 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get any smarter because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need to have a bunch of houses.</v>

1430
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernie owns a few houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1431
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I think he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And didn't mean one of the,</v>

1432
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.340
<v Speaker 2>he's in hot water right now because his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>

1433
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why she decided to go full on</v>

1434
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 2>capitalists for this small college and</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy up a bunch of land.</v>

1435
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:28.430
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the company went bankrupt.</v>

1436
00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The college,</v>

1437
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1438
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 2>The way that you can get young people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

1439
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:34.220
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>

1440
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:38.150
<v Speaker 2>even if they're not in the 1%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to get to the 1% right.</v>

1441
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Every body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people would say that's not true.</v>

1442
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.001
<v Speaker 2>Some people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1443
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be comfortable and I want to</v>

1444
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:45.540
<v Speaker 2>pursue whatever my interests are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1445
00:59:45.541 --> 00:59:46.700
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1446
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:49.460
<v Speaker 2>and what are those interests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people and be their art.</v>

1447
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1448
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 2>but they still have to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have,</v>

1449
00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.430
<v Speaker 2>they still need clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just wanted to be comfortable.</v>

1450
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't necessarily want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>white person,</v>

1451
00:59:57.501 --> 01:00:00.890
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to get those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>better from the free market.</v>

1452
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 2>The free market is going to make you</v>
<v Speaker 2>more comfortable than a government</v>

1453
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're just trying to have a</v>

1454
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:07.970
<v Speaker 2>shortcut and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1455
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just steal some money from that rich</v>

1456
01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 2>person and give it to me.</v>

1457
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 2>But most people even don't just want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeak by.</v>

1458
01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean most people want to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1459
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:20.480
<v Speaker 2>They want to strive to get the most they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can out of life.</v>

1460
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1461
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean somebody has to hire you,</v>

1462
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 2>somebody has to have the capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody has to be able to pay you,</v>

1463
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.821
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1464
01:00:27.821 --> 01:00:29.780
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get a job from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor person.</v>

1465
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have anything to offer.</v>

1466
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't have capital to give you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't pay,</v>

1467
01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:35.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write a paycheck.</v>

1468
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people understand,</v>

1469
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my first job from somebody in the</v>

1470
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:39.440
<v Speaker 2>1%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1471
01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:40.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm,</v>

1472
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the 1% myself because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1473
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I was able to gain some experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gain some knowledge,</v>

1474
01:00:46.071 --> 01:00:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could talk to younger people and</v>

1475
01:00:48.801 --> 01:00:51.650
<v Speaker 2>really show them the different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different path.</v>

1476
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:52.760
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1477
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>relying on government and thievery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's really,</v>

1478
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people would agree that theft is</v>

1479
01:00:57.681 --> 01:00:58.850
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1480
01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:01.820
<v Speaker 2>If the two of us got together and beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>you up,</v>

1481
01:01:01.821 --> 01:01:04.400
<v Speaker 2>although obviously we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as we could,</v>

1482
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:06.140
<v Speaker 2>we beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we took your money.</v>

1483
01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 2>You would say that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1484
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1485
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 2>if we got together and voted for</v>
<v Speaker 2>congressman to take your money,</v>

1486
01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we outvoted you two to one.</v>

1487
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Why is that any any better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1488
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 2>why is it okay to steal through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ballot box,</v>

1489
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's not okay to do it directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the argument against that would be</v>

1490
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that it's not stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're just creating policies that</v>

1491
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>even the playing field and that stealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are in the 1% like these</v>

1492
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 2>hedge fund dudes that have these giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses in the Hamptons,</v>

1493
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 2>they've accumulated massive amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth and they're using that to</v>

1494
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 2>influence politicians and change laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they shouldn't be able to use it to</v>

1495
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 2>influence politicians.</v>

1496
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have to take the influence</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from politicians,</v>

1497
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>take away that power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is a wealthy hedge fund guy.</v>

1498
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.500
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean I have the right to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal his Maserati just because he's</v>

1499
01:01:48.501 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 2>rich and I don't have the right to tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to take that maserati either.</v>

1500
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just another form of theft.</v>

1501
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 2>When you believe in the free market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>

1502
01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you know you're giving somebody that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1503
01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to get rich by stealing</v>

1504
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:03.440
<v Speaker 2>with somebody else has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it on your own and you know</v>

1505
01:02:03.441 --> 01:02:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can benefit from what other people</v>

1506
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 2>have because the only way people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and a free market is by delivering</v>

1507
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 2>service is that other people value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only exception is if you get rich</v>

1508
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>through government connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is not a fault of capitalism.</v>

1509
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 2>That is a fault of when you empower</v>
<v Speaker 2>government to sell favors for the</v>

1510
01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:22.914
<v Speaker 2>highest bidder.</v>

1511
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.500
<v Speaker 2>That is not an indictment of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is socialism,</v>

1512
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what we have to stamp out.</v>

1513
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 2>We have to make sure that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>succeed by bribing a politician,</v>

1514
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>that you can't use government power to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create wealth.</v>

1515
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:37.200
<v Speaker 2>That if you want to get wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be wealthy as a result of</v>

1516
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:41.130
<v Speaker 2>voluntary interactions with other human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings without government involvement,</v>

1517
01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government is there to protect my</v>

1518
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:44.730
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protect my property,</v>

1519
01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>protect my life from other people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>might infringe upon my rights from</v>

1520
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>people who could steal it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But government is not there to give you</v>

1521
01:02:50.431 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not there to give you a job.</v>

1522
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not there to give you a health</v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

1523
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>You need to earn those things on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

1524
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And now obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there going to be people who are</v>

1525
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:01.470
<v Speaker 2>just born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just not.</v>

1526
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>They may be they have deformities or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not smart enough or they have</v>

1527
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:07.470
<v Speaker 2>handy some kind of and they can't fend</v>
<v Speaker 2>for themselves.</v>

1528
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that,</v>

1529
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.590
<v Speaker 2>but my solution for that is not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not to steal from some wealthy person</v>

1530
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.320
<v Speaker 2>and say and give the money to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who needs it.</v>

1531
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I believe in voluntary charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that human beings care enough</v>

1532
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>about other human beings that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody really is in a dire</v>

1533
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that private charity,</v>

1534
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 2>we'll take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I do know is when you have</v>

1535
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>private charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1536
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:31.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1537
01:03:31.381 --> 01:03:31.921
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1538
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 2>if you donate a dollar to a charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 cents is going to go to the people</v>

1539
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:38.010
<v Speaker 2>who need money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideally,</v>

1540
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.830
<v Speaker 2>we have obviously some massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptions to that,</v>

1541
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>but with the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government will take a dollar in</v>

1542
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 2>taxes and only 10 cents will go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor people.</v>

1543
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.210
<v Speaker 2>The rest of it goes to the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy.</v>

1544
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with government is when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a private organization,</v>

1545
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.600
<v Speaker 2>they really want to do good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1546
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have these government</v>
<v Speaker 2>antipoverty programs,</v>

1547
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to end poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to expand poverty.</v>

1548
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want more poverty because then</v>

1549
01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>their program gets bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they have more power.</v>

1550
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>The last thing they want to do is end</v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty because now they're,</v>

1551
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 2>they no longer have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not there to try to make sure</v>

1552
01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.140
<v Speaker 2>that the people who are getting the aid</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually need the aid.</v>

1553
01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different when it's private money</v>

1554
01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:16.770
<v Speaker 2>and private charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1555
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:17.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1556
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you're really trying to do good instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just perpetuate the poverty so you</v>

1557
01:04:20.881 --> 01:04:24.060
<v Speaker 2>can grow your power base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever sat down with Bernie</v>

1558
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Sanders?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1559
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you love to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you love to have a debate with him,</v>

1560
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.260
<v Speaker 2>like a long form conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a three hour podcasts?</v>

1561
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't shy away from it.</v>

1562
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:32.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1563
01:04:32.671 --> 01:04:33.061
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1564
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I do know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's sold at this point that it's hard</v>

1565
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.520
<v Speaker 2>to believe that I'm going to persuade</v>
<v Speaker 2>him that he's wrong,</v>

1566
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to come to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>after living in entire life believing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1568
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even necessarily saying that you</v>

1569
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:46.380
<v Speaker 2>would persuade him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be nice to see people</v>

1570
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 2>counter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:04:47.461 --> 01:04:52.130
<v Speaker 2>or hear rather the counter to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments that he puts forth that are</v>

1572
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.930
<v Speaker 2>very appealing to a lot of these young</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you're talking about.</v>

1573
01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:56.970
<v Speaker 2>If you're 20 and you're not a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a heart,</v>

1574
01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:00.930
<v Speaker 2>you know that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas are very pervasive in our</v>

1575
01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>culture and they were thought to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to the ails that were in,</v>

1576
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:08.040
<v Speaker 2>they were thought to be the solutions to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems with the bailout.</v>

1577
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Why is the government getting all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and giving it to the banks when</v>

1578
01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>they could be giving it to poor people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1579
01:05:14.501 --> 01:05:17.990
<v Speaker 2>and propping up the income inequality</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1580
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that conversation.</v>

1581
01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:22.120
<v Speaker 4>And now we're big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I knew that at the beginning because</v>

1582
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 4>see I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was against the bailouts,</v>

1583
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 4>but I knew that when the government</v>
<v Speaker 4>bails out banks,</v>

1584
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 4>now you've created a precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>

1585
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to bail out those banks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not bail out the little guy?</v>

1586
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have a lot of sympathy for that</v>

1587
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think two wrongs make a</v>

1588
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:38.750
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't have bailed out the banks.</v>

1589
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 4>See the government shouldn't steal money</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

1590
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.600
<v Speaker 4>from one person and give it to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

1591
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless of who they're there,</v>

1592
01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.830
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're giving it to.</v>

1593
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.160
<v Speaker 4>But once you create that precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course,</v>

1594
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:53.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people should have been allowed</v>

1595
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:56.050
<v Speaker 4>to lose money in that financial crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of banks should have failed.</v>

1596
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people should have lost their</v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs and they didn't.</v>

1597
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.470
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a moral hazard because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government created a condition and said,</v>

1598
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to speculate and do all</v>

1599
01:06:04.811 --> 01:06:05.644
<v Speaker 4>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1600
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bail you out.</v>

1601
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>

1602
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:09.850
<v Speaker 4>you have to realize that it was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>

1603
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 4>the government was guaranteeing all</v>
<v Speaker 4>those mortgages.</v>

1604
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.040
<v Speaker 4>The governor was guaranteeing all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>bank banks,</v>

1605
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 4>bank deposits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government was through Fannie and</v>

1606
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Freddie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>encouraging reckless activity,</v>

1607
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 4>encouraging banks to make loans to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who they knew couldn't pay it</v>

1608
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:24.131
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1609
01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:28.150
<v Speaker 4>all this was rooted in government</v>
<v Speaker 4>incentives and government subsidies.</v>

1610
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.810
<v Speaker 4>If there was a pure free market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the banks would not be able to assume</v>

1611
01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:34.150
<v Speaker 4>all that risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because the government,</v>

1612
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had their back then they were be able,</v>

1613
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.430
<v Speaker 4>they were able to do things that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>free market never would have allowed.</v>

1614
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 4>That's why for years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1615
01:06:40.841 --> 01:06:43.900
<v Speaker 4>while the housing bubble was going up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was pointing this stuff out.</v>

1616
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go and you know,</v>

1617
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 4>look at some of the youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1618
01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all of my appearances back then that</v>

1619
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:52.120
<v Speaker 4>eventually became that Peter Schiff was</v>
<v Speaker 4>right video.</v>

1620
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understood the,</v>

1621
01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate consequences of what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government was doing,</v>

1622
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then the bailouts just,</v>

1623
01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:02.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed the government,</v>

1624
01:07:02.921 --> 01:07:05.020
<v Speaker 4>like the government never wants to waste</v>
<v Speaker 4>a crisis.</v>

1625
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 4>They always want to use the crisis to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get bigger,</v>

1626
01:07:06.911 --> 01:07:09.730
<v Speaker 4>to get more power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should have learned something from</v>

1627
01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:12.250
<v Speaker 4>the 2008 financial crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead,</v>

1628
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 4>we have repeated all the mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1629
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Everything that has been done by Janet</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yellen and Ben Bernakie,</v>

1630
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.610
<v Speaker 4>since the financial crisis has actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>made the u s economy worse,</v>

1631
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:24.040
<v Speaker 4>we're in much worse shape now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>economically.</v>

1632
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 4>So I think the crisis that we're coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1633
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:30.020
<v Speaker 4>the next one is going to be much worse</v>
<v Speaker 4>than the one we had to know.</v>

1634
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Eight to get to that in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>

1635
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.220
<v Speaker 4>what was the argument for the bailout?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1636
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:38.980
<v Speaker 4>the argument for the bailout was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the banks were just so big,</v>

1637
01:07:38.981 --> 01:07:39.491
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1638
01:07:39.491 --> 01:07:41.040
<v Speaker 4>they were interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:45.520
<v Speaker 4>And that if we let them fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just going to be so much worse.</v>

1640
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's just,</v>

1641
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.403
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got,</v>

1642
01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1643
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 4>we got to a bail amount because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1644
01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 4>even though it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be worse if we don't do it.</v>

1645
01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:56.650
<v Speaker 4>People like me and maybe Jamie had money</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these banks and that money would</v>

1646
01:07:56.651 --> 01:07:58.660
<v Speaker 4>dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well people would have lost,</v>

1647
01:07:58.661 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 4>certainly would deposit of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had lost some money.</v>

1648
01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Yes they would have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1649
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:05.520
<v Speaker 4>I agree that had we not done the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bailouts,</v>

1650
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:09.550
<v Speaker 4>it would have been worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would have been healthy.</v>

1651
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 4>It would have been a step in the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

1652
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.961
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1653
01:08:12.961 --> 01:08:13.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you work out,</v>

1654
01:08:13.931 --> 01:08:15.560
<v Speaker 4>it's like no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no gain.</v>

1655
01:08:15.561 --> 01:08:16.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1656
01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:16.874
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1657
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.950
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1658
01:08:17.951 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 4>you've got to bite the bullet on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1659
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:21.281
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1660
01:08:21.281 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do what's right.</v>

1661
01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:23.380
<v Speaker 4>Or I look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1662
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:27.530
<v Speaker 4>we were strung out on cheap money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were like a drug addict.</v>

1663
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:31.910
<v Speaker 4>And had we just gone cold Turkey and</v>
<v Speaker 4>gone into Rehab,</v>

1664
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would have been a big downer.</v>

1665
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't have been pleasant.</v>

1666
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 4>And we would had to go through all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

1667
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:42.200
<v Speaker 4>but at the end of the day we could</v>
<v Speaker 4>emerge healthy instead models</v>

1668
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.970
<v Speaker 3>being projected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>projected,</v>

1669
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.490
<v Speaker 3>like did bid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people look at the two possibilities,</v>

1670
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Speaker 3>like having no bail out and we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at us here in nine years later</v>

1671
01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.740
<v Speaker 3>or having available,</v>

1672
01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.321
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1673
01:08:53.321 --> 01:08:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they looked at anything,</v>

1674
01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.770
<v Speaker 4>it was just very short term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1675
01:08:56.771 --> 01:08:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Because all these guys are politically</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated,</v>

1676
01:08:58.751 --> 01:09:00.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>An election is coming up,</v>

1677
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:02.320
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because all the bailouts happened,</v>

1678
01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:03.483
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1679
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>summer of Oh eight,</v>

1680
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.140
<v Speaker 4>a lot of big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the election was in November of</v>

1681
01:09:08.141 --> 01:09:08.890
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1682
01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I remember John Mccain interrupted his</v>
<v Speaker 4>presidential campaign to come vote for a</v>

1683
01:09:13.871 --> 01:09:15.270
<v Speaker 4>tarp bailout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1684
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.550
<v Speaker 4>and so politicians can't see beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next election.</v>

1685
01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:22.180
<v Speaker 4>And if your horizon is that short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1686
01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:26.950
<v Speaker 4>the bailouts ease the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the cost of exacerbating the</v>

1687
01:09:26.951 --> 01:09:29.470
<v Speaker 4>underlying disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the cause of the pain.</v>

1688
01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.640
<v Speaker 4>So because we did all the wrong things</v>
<v Speaker 4>and o eight o nine o 10,</v>

1689
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.840
<v Speaker 4>instead of fixing the problems and</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a healthy recovery,</v>

1690
01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:40.960
<v Speaker 4>we have the weakest recovery in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>history of recoveries.</v>

1691
01:09:40.961 --> 01:09:42.640
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it's a recovery cause</v>

1692
01:09:42.641 --> 01:09:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I think the average American is sicker</v>
<v Speaker 4>now than he was when the recovery began.</v>

1693
01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at personal net worth has gone</v>

1694
01:09:49.601 --> 01:09:51.820
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Real incomes have gone down.</v>

1695
01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:56.800
<v Speaker 4>We've eviscerated the labor force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people have lost good paying jobs</v>

1696
01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.860
<v Speaker 4>and they now have two or three low</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying part time jobs.</v>

1697
01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.170
<v Speaker 4>People are working longer for less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1698
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.870
<v Speaker 4>their net worths of gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're loaded up with debt.</v>

1699
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:09.160
<v Speaker 4>We now have record high cardio loans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>record high credit card debt record,</v>

1700
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:11.560
<v Speaker 4>high student loans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing we don't have as record</v>

1701
01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:13.480
<v Speaker 4>mortgage debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's because home ownership is now</v>

1702
01:10:13.481 --> 01:10:17.200
<v Speaker 4>at a 60 year low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we do have rising rents and so our</v>

1703
01:10:17.201 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 4>standard of living is falling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1704
01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:22.480
<v Speaker 4>because we didn't do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because we didn't do the right</v>

1705
01:10:22.481 --> 01:10:24.820
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this next crisis,</v>

1706
01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:27.040
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be so much worse where we're</v>

1707
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:30.970
<v Speaker 4>just going from crisis to crisis because</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody has the guts to do the right</v>

1708
01:10:30.971 --> 01:10:34.240
<v Speaker 4>thing because in the short run it means</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might not get reelected,</v>

1709
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1710
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.580
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to get reelected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>promising.</v>

1711
01:10:36.581 --> 01:10:38.140
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things are bad.</v>

1712
01:10:38.141 --> 01:10:40.990
<v Speaker 4>We've made a lot of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have to suffer through</v>

1713
01:10:40.991 --> 01:10:43.540
<v Speaker 4>this recession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are going to lose money.</v>

1714
01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:45.250
<v Speaker 4>People are going to lose their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>

1715
01:10:45.251 --> 01:10:47.470
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The free market is going to work.</v>

1716
01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.310
<v Speaker 4>You'll get different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll get your,</v>

1717
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:51.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody has the guts to tell the truth to</v>

1718
01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:54.580
<v Speaker 4>the voters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone wants to pretend that they've</v>

1719
01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:55.331
<v Speaker 4>got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1720
01:10:55.331 --> 01:10:56.164
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1721
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.080
<v Speaker 4>by my Miracle Cure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to work out.</v>

1722
01:10:59.081 --> 01:11:01.430
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to die it just rub this</v>
<v Speaker 4>cream on your,</v>

1723
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:03.130
<v Speaker 4>your thighs and the side lights going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go away.</v>

1724
01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what people want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to be told,</v>

1725
01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.810
<v Speaker 4>you gotta hit the gym and you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop eating junk food.</v>

1726
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.300
<v Speaker 4>They want the miracle cream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy that gets the vote.</v>

1727
01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 4>So we set ourselves up for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a crisis,</v>

1728
01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 4>not just a financial crisis where were</v>
<v Speaker 4>mortgages are in trouble,</v>

1729
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:19.980
<v Speaker 4>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dollar itself is collapsing,</v>

1730
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:23.340
<v Speaker 4>our money is collapsing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prices are skyrocketing.</v>

1731
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.510
<v Speaker 4>It's going to really hit the average</v>
<v Speaker 4>American much more than just the stock</v>

1732
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 4>market going down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when your money is going down,</v>

1733
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the cost of living is skyrocketing,</v>

1734
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.430
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is going to be a big problem for a</v>

1735
01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 4>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's where we're headed.</v>

1736
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:39.000
<v Speaker 4>It's ultimately going to be a dollar</v>
<v Speaker 4>crisis.</v>

1737
01:11:39.001 --> 01:11:40.250
<v Speaker 4>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1738
01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 4>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my business in my brokerage firm and</v>

1739
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Euro Pacific capital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I've tried to do is help</v>

1740
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:49.170
<v Speaker 4>people protect their wealth by getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of US dollar assets by investing in</v>

1741
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:52.110
<v Speaker 4>Singapore and Switzerland and New</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zealand and Hong Kong and other</v>

1742
01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 4>countries owning other assets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1743
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:58.530
<v Speaker 4>to try to protect themselves from this</v>
<v Speaker 4>crisis that you know is coming.</v>

1744
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and most people are going to get</v>

1745
01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:02.730
<v Speaker 4>blindsided by just like they were by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last one.</v>

1746
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 3>So what is the crisis and how exactly do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel it's going to go down?</v>

1747
01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Because I did watch some of your videos</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the housing crisis from 2008</v>

1748
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.080
<v Speaker 3>you're predicting it years in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1749
01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1750
01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.810
<v Speaker 3>things always happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1751
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I see things years before they happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause like you're not the only one,</v>

1752
01:12:18.321 --> 01:12:18.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1753
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.350
<v Speaker 3>This is something amongst your peers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your colleagues,</v>

1754
01:12:21.351 --> 01:12:22.910
<v Speaker 3>you guys are all discussing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1755
01:12:22.911 --> 01:12:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are people,</v>

1756
01:12:24.351 --> 01:12:24.720
<v Speaker 3>oh</v>

1757
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 4>most people who feel the way I do maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't,</v>

1758
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:30.840
<v Speaker 4>they weren't on television saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were saying it to their buddies,</v>

1759
01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their own living rooms and they were</v>

1760
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:34.070
<v Speaker 4>getting laughed at just like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1761
01:12:34.071 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I guess I used to get emails from</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1762
01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been saying this is exactly what</v>

1763
01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I've been saying and everybody thinks</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm crazy and you know,</v>

1764
01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1765
01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:43.140
<v Speaker 4>they're the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's everybody else.</v>

1766
01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just,</v>

1767
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:48.540
<v Speaker 4>it gets caught up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's going to happen is we are</v>

1768
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:51.900
<v Speaker 4>going to go back at some point into</v>
<v Speaker 4>another statistic.</v>

1769
01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Recession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think that we've kind of been</v>

1770
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:57.240
<v Speaker 4>in one this whole recovery cause I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>think the government numbers are really</v>

1771
01:12:57.241 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 4>that accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that inflation is as low</v>

1772
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 4>as they claim at least as measured by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consumer prices.</v>

1773
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 4>So I think that the economy has actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>been contracting during the years that</v>

1774
01:13:07.711 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 4>we've been pretending it's been growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do think at some point</v>

1775
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:15.870
<v Speaker 4>statistically we will go back into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>technical recession where even the</v>

1776
01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:18.150
<v Speaker 4>government admits that the economy</v>
<v Speaker 4>shrinking,</v>

1777
01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:21.990
<v Speaker 4>right where the GDP is negative for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of quarters in a row and then</v>

1778
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:24.240
<v Speaker 4>what is the government going to do as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>result of that?</v>

1779
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:25.890
<v Speaker 4>They're going to do exactly what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>did before.</v>

1780
01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 4>They're going to take interest rates and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring them back to zero from wherever</v>

1781
01:13:28.981 --> 01:13:30.360
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The differences.</v>

1782
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Normally they lower interest rates and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then by the time there's another</v>

1783
01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 4>recession their way back up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four or five 6% this time they,</v>

1784
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 4>they barely got him back to 1% and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>kept them at zero for seven,</v>

1785
01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:43.380
<v Speaker 4>eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is unprecedented.</v>

1786
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:48.060
<v Speaker 4>And of course the mistakes that are made</v>
<v Speaker 4>are consequence of money being too</v>

1787
01:13:48.061 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 4>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1788
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 4>The reason that we had a real estate</v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble,</v>

1789
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.390
<v Speaker 4>the main reason was because Alan</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greenspan lowered interest rates to 1%</v>

1790
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.990
<v Speaker 4>and left them there for about a year and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a half and then took about a year and a</v>

1791
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 4>half to rise to raise him back up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>

1792
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:03.810
<v Speaker 4>So you had a few years of artificially</v>
<v Speaker 4>low interest rates and that gave us this</v>

1793
01:14:03.811 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 4>huge housing bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1794
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.020
<v Speaker 4>we had seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight years of zero.</v>

1795
01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mistakes that had been made under</v>

1796
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Obama dwarfs the mistakes that were made</v>
<v Speaker 4>under Bush.</v>

1797
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 4>And these are mistakes that are a</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of money being too cheap of</v>

1798
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 4>the government setting the price of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money as opposed to the free market.</v>

1799
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:21.100
<v Speaker 4>You get too much debt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get too much speculation.</v>

1800
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 4>And so we've got a much bigger bubble</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and when the,</v>

1801
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 4>this one pops because it's so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger,</v>

1802
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then all of a sudden the Fed has to</v>

1803
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 4>cut interest rates again.</v>

1804
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 4>And now what happens to the dollar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because see the dollar has been rising</v>

1805
01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:37.690
<v Speaker 4>in these past few years because</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody thought,</v>

1806
01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Fed's going to normalize interest</v>

1807
01:14:39.401 --> 01:14:41.020
<v Speaker 4>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Fed is going to shrink the balance</v>

1808
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:45.190
<v Speaker 4>sheet when none of this stuff happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the Fed goes back to another round</v>

1809
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 4>of quantitative easing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they got to crank up the printing</v>

1810
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:49.720
<v Speaker 4>presses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they don't shrink the balance</v>

1811
01:14:49.721 --> 01:14:51.130
<v Speaker 4>sheet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they bloat even bigger,</v>

1812
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes to five and a half trillion,</v>

1813
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:55.660
<v Speaker 4>six and a half trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the bottom's to drop out of the</v>

1814
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:57.250
<v Speaker 4>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the dollar is going to get</v>

1815
01:14:57.251 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The opposite of what happened in Oh</v>

1816
01:14:59.681 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 4>eight when the financial crisis hit no</v>
<v Speaker 4>aid,</v>

1817
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.670
<v Speaker 4>the dollar had been falling for seven</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1818
01:15:03.671 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 4>It was at an all time record low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when the crisis hit,</v>

1819
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 4>it actually caused people to buy the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar.</v>

1820
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think this next crisis is going to</v>

1821
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 4>be the big sell signal for the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because people are going to rush</v>

1822
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:20.650
<v Speaker 4>out of the dollar as the Fed has to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to more qe as people realize that</v>

1823
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 4>this is what I said from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a monetary roach motel,</v>

1824
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Fed checked us in and they ain't</v>

1825
01:15:25.631 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 4>checking us out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to normalize rates.</v>

1826
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to shrink the balance</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheet,</v>

1827
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:33.190
<v Speaker 4>and when people realize that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>permanent situation,</v>

1828
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.760
<v Speaker 4>the bottom drops out of the dollar and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then commodity prices really start to</v>

1829
01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 4>rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when oil prices went from like</v>

1830
01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:43.960
<v Speaker 4>$20 a barrel and 19 and 2001 up to 150</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1831
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.680
<v Speaker 4>That was happening because the dollar</v>
<v Speaker 4>was falling and as the dollar starts to</v>

1832
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:49.620
<v Speaker 4>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these commodity prices are gonna</v>

1833
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:53.470
<v Speaker 4>rise again and now inflation is really</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pick up the way they measure it</v>

1834
01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:54.940
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the governor can't do anything about it.</v>

1835
01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.850
<v Speaker 4>They can't raise interest rates because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they raise interest rates,</v>

1836
01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.880
<v Speaker 4>they collapse everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the banks that were too big to fail.</v>

1837
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 4>They're bigger now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it would be even worse if they</v>

1838
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:05.300
<v Speaker 4>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can't let rates go up because</v>

1839
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.930
<v Speaker 4>banks absorbed other banks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got bigger,</v>

1840
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 4>and now you have all these banks that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have all these long term loans that have</v>

1841
01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:14.260
<v Speaker 4>low coupons on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If interest rates go up,</v>

1842
01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 4>all these big banks are going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1843
01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:18.550
<v Speaker 4>people think rising rates are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be good for banks.</v>

1844
01:16:18.551 --> 01:16:21.160
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna destroy the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna destroy the housing</v>

1845
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:21.880
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1846
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.440
<v Speaker 4>and the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the biggest thing.</v>

1847
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.620
<v Speaker 4>Look at the national debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The national debt is about 20 trillion,</v>

1848
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.540
<v Speaker 4>the bonded debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

1849
01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:30.760
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't even count all the unfunded</v>

1850
01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 4>liabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just where the government has</v>

1851
01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:33.970
<v Speaker 4>sold a bond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1852
01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.010
<v Speaker 4>A treasury bond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's about 20 trillion.</v>

1853
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:39.880
<v Speaker 4>But what would happen if interest rates</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to 10% well,</v>

1854
01:16:39.881 --> 01:16:44.620
<v Speaker 4>it would cost the government $2 trillion</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year just to pay the interest on that</v>

1855
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 4>20,000 on the 20 trillion we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere close to that.</v>

1856
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

1857
01:16:49.121 --> 01:16:52.600
<v Speaker 4>interest rates are almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're spending about 250 billion a</v>

1858
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:56.200
<v Speaker 4>year on interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if interest rates actually went up</v>

1859
01:16:56.410 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 4>because the Fed had to fight inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the treasurer would have to default.</v>

1860
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 4>They would have to tell the cro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't pay on these bonds.</v>

1861
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.910
<v Speaker 4>What are you showing me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie's this,</v>

1862
01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:07.900
<v Speaker 4>the national debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The national debt is 20 trillion yet.</v>

1863
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so clause 19</v>

1864
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 2>nine seven three looking at spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1865
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:14.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>

1866
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1867
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:20.480
<v Speaker 2>and so obviously the Fed has to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest rates low so the government can</v>

1868
01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:22.310
<v Speaker 2>service that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Medicare,</v>

1869
01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Medicaid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1870
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.290
<v Speaker 2>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You add it all up.</v>

1871
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a trillion?</v>

1872
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that right there?</v>

1873
01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:32.000
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1874
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 2>that's one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1 trillion.</v>

1875
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1876
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.350
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of those budget items.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are budget items.</v>

1877
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Security,</v>

1878
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:41.240
<v Speaker 2>that's not the debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're spending.</v>

1879
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1880
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.320
<v Speaker 2>look at those numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go down lower you,</v>

1881
01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:48.260
<v Speaker 2>they'll probably have all the unfunded</v>
<v Speaker 2>liabilities that page somewhere,</v>

1882
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they break it down and they</v>

1883
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:52.940
<v Speaker 2>break it down per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>per tax payer.</v>

1884
01:17:52.941 --> 01:17:53.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an art,</v>

1885
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:57.860
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that we've got like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustable rate mortgage on that</v>

1886
01:17:57.861 --> 01:17:58.490
<v Speaker 2>national debt.</v>

1887
01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:00.260
<v Speaker 2>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scot ultra cheap money.</v>

1888
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:03.740
<v Speaker 2>If interest rates spike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that the government can</v>

1889
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:05.570
<v Speaker 2>pay that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hypnotic.</v>

1890
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.450
<v Speaker 2>It really is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're seen it before.</v>

1891
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it before either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm saying Puerto Rico,</v>

1892
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.381
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be,</v>

1893
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:17.030
<v Speaker 2>it would be so idiotic for Puerto Rico</v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to join the union and absorb</v>

1894
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 2>their share of that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1895
01:18:18.201 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 2>for the average person like myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was zero understanding of the financial</v>

1896
01:18:21.681 --> 01:18:22.880
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You listen to trump,</v>

1897
01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:27.280
<v Speaker 2>talk about the economy booming and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an upward the thing and the</v>

1898
01:18:27.281 --> 01:18:30.470
<v Speaker 2>unemployment is down and jobs are up.</v>

1899
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean bullshit.</v>

1900
01:18:32.190 --> 01:18:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's really bothering me about</v>

1901
01:18:34.021 --> 01:18:37.710
<v Speaker 4>trump is the hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when trump was a candidate and</v>

1902
01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:40.950
<v Speaker 4>he got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because by and large he told the truth</v>

1903
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:44.850
<v Speaker 4>about the phony nature of the recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama was out there talking about how</v>

1904
01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:46.890
<v Speaker 4>great things were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and trump was like,</v>

1905
01:18:46.891 --> 01:18:47.970
<v Speaker 4>bs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not great.</v>

1906
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about low unemployment.</v>

1907
01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:54.060
<v Speaker 4>That number is bogus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real unemployment rate is 20% or 25%</v>

1908
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:56.400
<v Speaker 4>is people stopped looking for jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't count anymore.</v>

1909
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.353
<v Speaker 4>People are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1910
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:59.550
<v Speaker 4>they gave up looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they don't have a job.</v>

1911
01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:03.120
<v Speaker 4>They're not counted as being unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he pointed out that all the jobs</v>

1912
01:19:03.121 --> 01:19:04.260
<v Speaker 4>like here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is irony,</v>

1913
01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:06.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are the byproducts of obamacare?</v>

1914
01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:10.350
<v Speaker 4>Obamacare said that if you have a full</v>
<v Speaker 4>time worker,</v>

1915
01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.050
<v Speaker 4>you have to give him health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1916
01:19:13.051 --> 01:19:15.690
<v Speaker 4>And full time was anyone that worked 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours or more?</v>

1917
01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>employers aren't dumb.</v>

1918
01:19:17.341 --> 01:19:18.450
<v Speaker 4>They can do math.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1919
01:19:18.451 --> 01:19:21.510
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this guy is working 40 hours a week,</v>

1920
01:19:21.511 --> 01:19:23.040
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to give them health insurance,</v>

1921
01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:25.860
<v Speaker 4>which is very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if he works 29 hours a week,</v>

1922
01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1923
01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.880
<v Speaker 4>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Employers started transitioning their</v>

1924
01:19:29.881 --> 01:19:33.330
<v Speaker 4>workforces from full time workers to</v>
<v Speaker 4>part time workers.</v>

1925
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens if I'm going to have only</v>

1926
01:19:35.731 --> 01:19:38.040
<v Speaker 4>part time workers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have more workers,</v>

1927
01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.140
<v Speaker 4>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because each one is working fewer hours.</v>

1928
01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.410
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to have to have more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have more jobs,</v>

1929
01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:44.244
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have,</v>

1930
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:47.460
<v Speaker 4>if I had 500 part time jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I have a thousand,</v>

1931
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I had 500 full time employees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I have a thousand part time</v>

1932
01:19:51.661 --> 01:19:53.910
<v Speaker 4>employees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's twice as many jobs.</v>

1933
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Obama got credit for all those extra</v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs,</v>

1934
01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.473
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As we were,</v>

1935
01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.130
<v Speaker 4>as we were destroying fulltime jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>replacing them with two part time jobs.</v>

1936
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:05.790
<v Speaker 4>We got all these jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So trump was honest as it candidate.</v>

1937
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.210
<v Speaker 4>These are low paying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are crappy jobs,</v>

1938
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.890
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of the people that were</v>

1939
01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:13.710
<v Speaker 4>getting jobs were older people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want jobs.</v>

1940
01:20:13.711 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 4>They were retired and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>working at Mcdonald's part time because</v>

1941
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 4>they can't live on their retirement</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

1942
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.513
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1943
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.100
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the labor force</v>
<v Speaker 4>participation rate that he would talk</v>

1944
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1945
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 4>we're labor force participation is</v>
<v Speaker 4>collapsing is with young people.</v>

1946
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.540
<v Speaker 4>People in their twenties and thirties</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't get jobs.</v>

1947
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:34.080
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile 70 and 80 year olds are</v>
<v Speaker 4>working in record percentages,</v>

1948
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause they can't afford to retire and</v>

1949
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:40.530
<v Speaker 4>their grandkids can't get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so trump was telling the truth about</v>

1950
01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 4>how bad the economy really was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that resonated.</v>

1951
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:48.081
<v Speaker 4>A lot of blue collar guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Democrats in the Midwest voted</v>

1952
01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:52.470
<v Speaker 4>for trump because he got it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he understood their p felt their pain,</v>

1953
01:20:52.471 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1954
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Like Bill Clinton and Obama was in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy of an,</v>

1955
01:20:55.941 --> 01:21:00.360
<v Speaker 4>hillary was pretending that everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>was great under Obama and people didn't</v>

1956
01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:02.820
<v Speaker 4>want four more years of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they voted for trump.</v>

1957
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:03.871
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1958
01:21:03.871 --> 01:21:07.530
<v Speaker 4>when trump was a candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he talked about the stock market because</v>

1959
01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:10.650
<v Speaker 4>all of the stock market was going up</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Obama was president.</v>

1960
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:11.371
<v Speaker 4>And trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1961
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who cares about the stock market?</v>

1962
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:15.180
<v Speaker 4>This is a big fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ugly bubble.</v>

1963
01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Wait til it pops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1964
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 4>He was right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's president.</v>

1965
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.120
<v Speaker 4>What is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time I see him,</v>

1966
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.850
<v Speaker 4>this stock market's a new record high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fantastic.</v>

1967
01:21:23.851 --> 01:21:25.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all because of me.</v>

1968
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 4>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when the jobs numbers come out,</v>

1969
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:28.320
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1970
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.200
<v Speaker 4>look how low the unemployment rate is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the lowest it's been in 15</v>

1971
01:21:31.201 --> 01:21:32.700
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing a great job.</v>

1972
01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing has changed.</v>

1973
01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:36.570
<v Speaker 4>This is the exact same economy he</v>
<v Speaker 4>inherited.</v>

1974
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 4>It's the same crappy jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same stock market bubble.</v>

1975
01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.810
<v Speaker 4>The only difference is he's not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate anymore.</v>

1976
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 4>He's the president and now he's trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to market the same crappy economy that</v>

1977
01:21:47.311 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Obama had and pretending everything is</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1978
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 4>And I wish he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve would stay true to the candidate</v>

1979
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:54.720
<v Speaker 4>and admit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1980
01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:57.750
<v Speaker 4>the economy is still a disaster because</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing has changed,</v>

1981
01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was gonna drain the swamp.</v>

1982
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Instead he just poured more water in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same swap,</v>

1983
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.160
<v Speaker 4>let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to actually drain it means to really</v>

1984
01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:07.590
<v Speaker 4>shake things up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in a way he's shaking things up,</v>

1985
01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:09.990
<v Speaker 4>but not the way that's going to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful change.</v>

1986
01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.280
<v Speaker 4>For the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1987
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.430
<v Speaker 4>The shaking up that he's doing is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people were voting for,</v>

1988
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:17.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really need real substantive economic</v>

1989
01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:20.310
<v Speaker 4>change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the president is not able to deliver</v>

1990
01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:21.930
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's surrounded himself with the</v>

1991
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:24.750
<v Speaker 4>same cronies that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were around in the Bush</v>

1992
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:25.650
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1993
01:22:25.651 --> 01:22:27.760
<v Speaker 4>what good is going back to Bush?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1994
01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.110
<v Speaker 3>what does his incentive to do this in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place?</v>

1995
01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:32.240
<v Speaker 3>The guys already wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1996
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:34.850
<v Speaker 3>and then he gets into this position and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he's a salesman.</v>

1997
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Right now he's trying to sell us on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ax and everything's great.</v>

1998
01:22:37.731 --> 01:22:39.830
<v Speaker 3>And under him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's booming and it's going to</v>

1999
01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:41.180
<v Speaker 3>keep booming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get better,</v>

2000
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:42.980
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to make America great</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2001
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2002
01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.680
<v Speaker 4>it was a good slogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know why?</v>

2003
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:47.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump's always been a salesman,</v>

2004
01:22:47.091 --> 01:22:47.540
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

2005
01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:48.800
<v Speaker 4>he's a marketer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's his,</v>

2006
01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:50.540
<v Speaker 4>he makes money on his brands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2007
01:22:50.541 --> 01:22:51.860
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in his blood.</v>

2008
01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:53.410
<v Speaker 4>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he obviously does it,</v>

2009
01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.270
<v Speaker 4>does it well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he became very successful.</v>

2010
01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.231
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2011
01:22:57.231 --> 01:23:00.350
<v Speaker 4>marketing is brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think he's Kinda continuing</v>

2012
01:23:00.351 --> 01:23:01.600
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2013
01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.331
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2014
01:23:02.331 --> 01:23:04.160
<v Speaker 4>does he think about his legacy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2015
01:23:04.161 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 4>does he want to actually a difference?</v>

2016
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Does he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he care about posterity and how</v>

2017
01:23:08.801 --> 01:23:10.240
<v Speaker 2>he's viewed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2018
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2019
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he just trying to get reelected to so</v>

2020
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 2>we can be the president again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2021
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a conversation with him</v>

2022
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:19.810
<v Speaker 2>and I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I only remember meeting him one</v>

2023
01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a concert and we were sitting</v>

2024
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 2>like on the same row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was right next to me.</v>

2025
01:23:23.891 --> 01:23:24.724
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2026
01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:25.730
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2027
01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 2>a crosby stills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nash and young.</v>

2028
01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I happen to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was there with his daughter and I</v>

2029
01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:32.980
<v Speaker 2>think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

2030
01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her fiance,</v>

2031
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they were married yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're married now so that they</v>

2032
01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:37.840
<v Speaker 2>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to say hello.</v>

2033
01:23:37.841 --> 01:23:39.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the only time I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>met him.</v>

2034
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:42.580
<v Speaker 2>And so it wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get a chance to engage him in</v>

2035
01:23:42.581 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 2>any kind of thoughtful conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people who know him</v>

2036
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:47.321
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2037
01:23:47.321 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people who have been in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his circle,</v>

2038
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but they've never kind of introduced me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

2039
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.510
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2040
01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't really,</v>

2041
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:55.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really know.</v>

2042
01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2043
01:23:57.401 --> 01:23:59.890
<v Speaker 2>I voted for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was why you vote for him.</v>

2044
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Because I didn't want to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary now.</v>

2045
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I knew it didn't matter cause I lived in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut.</v>

2046
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:04.931
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2047
01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:06.910
<v Speaker 2>now that I live in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't vote anymore.</v>

2048
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.260
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2049
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:09.580
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things people say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2050
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico's in trouble because you</v>

2051
01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:12.460
<v Speaker 2>can't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

2052
01:24:12.461 --> 01:24:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Everyone I voted for in Connecticut lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congress.</v>

2053
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

2054
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have congressional</v>

2055
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:21.400
<v Speaker 2>representation because I'd rather have</v>
<v Speaker 2>no taxes and no vote then to be able to</v>

2056
01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 2>vote for who taxes me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2057
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I voted for him.</v>

2058
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2059
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I normally would just vote for Gary</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson.</v>

2060
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had voted for Gary Johnson before</v>

2061
01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.160
<v Speaker 2>because this is the second time you ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I voted for him the last time.</v>

2062
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2063
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2064
01:24:36.431 --> 01:24:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way to the polls,</v>

2065
01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:39.040
<v Speaker 2>my wife was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2066
01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:40.960
<v Speaker 2>we got to vote for trump because it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2067
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:43.990
<v Speaker 2>he was like the best protest vote I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could cast.</v>

2068
01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was a bigger in your face</v>

2069
01:24:46.151 --> 01:24:50.680
<v Speaker 2>to the establishment then voting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson was,</v>

2070
01:24:50.681 --> 01:24:52.540
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they ran a bad campaign.</v>

2071
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 2>They really blew an opportunity to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>done something with the libertarian</v>

2072
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:57.410
<v Speaker 2>brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2073
01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.510
<v Speaker 2>for future elections.</v>

2074
01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:00.710
<v Speaker 2>So I wasn't happy with the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign ran.</v>

2075
01:25:00.711 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 2>And they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had an opportunity there with how</v>

2076
01:25:02.921 --> 01:25:05.800
<v Speaker 2>unpopular both candidates were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2077
01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:06.550
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2078
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I just felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2079
01:25:07.931 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 2>this is the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2080
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought trump was going to win.</v>

2081
01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:11.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought that there's no way</v>

2082
01:25:11.831 --> 01:25:13.260
<v Speaker 2>he's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2083
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:13.841
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2084
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:14.980
<v Speaker 2>he might lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2085
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was 100% guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>

2086
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was more likely to win than</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose because I thought other people</v>

2087
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 2>would think the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew the economy was a lot worse than</v>

2088
01:25:24.881 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 2>was being portrayed by the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Federal Reserve,</v>

2089
01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.910
<v Speaker 2>by Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought a lot of people would,</v>

2090
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:31.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would vote that way.</v>

2091
01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And I knew the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2092
01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe not be trusted because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to tell the pollsters that</v>

2093
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 2>they were voting for trump because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2094
01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you a racist,</v>

2095
01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you vote?</v>

2096
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get in there and vote,</v>

2097
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:42.430
<v Speaker 2>they're going to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2098
01:25:42.431 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 2>their pocket book and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was offering the most,</v>

2099
01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:46.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2100
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.000
<v Speaker 2>the message that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew America wasn't great.</v>

2101
01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:50.530
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton was like,</v>

2102
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to make America great</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2103
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.280
<v Speaker 2>It's already great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the average guys,</v>

2104
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel so great to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2105
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:58.870
<v Speaker 2>My of living is going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing going up is my debt.</v>

2106
01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:01.480
<v Speaker 2>And so they voted for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2107
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I think this strategy is to blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like</v>

2108
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 4>what trump is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think his strategy is?</v>

2109
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he is,</v>

2110
01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.070
<v Speaker 4>he has now claimed ownership of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>economy.</v>

2111
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 4>He has put the trump brand on this stock</v>
<v Speaker 4>market bubble.</v>

2112
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 4>So when the market goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the economy tanks back into</v>

2113
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:20.090
<v Speaker 4>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not Obama's recession,</v>

2114
01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 4>it's trump's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2115
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:24.530
<v Speaker 4>he's basically taken the bait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's the fall guy.</v>

2116
01:26:24.531 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 4>I think the Fed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's going to blame it all on</v>

2117
01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:26.900
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2118
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.270
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he inherited this great economy from</v>

2119
01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he didn't.</v>

2120
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:32.300
<v Speaker 4>And now look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a mess.</v>

2121
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 4>So he should not be claiming credit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get for victories.</v>

2122
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:39.080
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should be setting us up for this</v>

2123
01:26:39.081 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 4>collapse that is already coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not because of him.</v>

2124
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 4>He needs to clean up the mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just Obama's mess,</v>

2125
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:47.660
<v Speaker 4>it's Bush's mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Democrats and Republicans worked</v>

2126
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 4>together to screw this economy up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Federal Reserve was a big part of</v>

2127
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:52.070
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2128
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.511
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2129
01:26:52.511 --> 01:26:55.220
<v Speaker 4>and trump criticized the fed as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate.</v>

2130
01:26:55.221 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2131
01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:57.230
<v Speaker 4>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loves the fit.</v>

2132
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't there some sort of improvement in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stock market because people had</v>

2133
01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:02.500
<v Speaker 4>confidence that he was going to enact</v>
<v Speaker 4>these changes and he was,</v>

2134
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is better for businesses.</v>

2135
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that that was able to add</v>

2136
01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:08.420
<v Speaker 4>some air to the bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2137
01:27:08.421 --> 01:27:10.900
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a big bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

2138
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 4>when trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden people start thinking,</v>

2139
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:13.791
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2140
01:27:13.791 --> 01:27:17.270
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get tax cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get regulatory reform,</v>

2141
01:27:17.271 --> 01:27:21.590
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get more economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the market rallied on that.</v>

2142
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think that that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to happen.</v>

2143
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2144
01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.110
<v Speaker 4>they didn't repeal obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big part of the,</v>

2145
01:27:29.111 --> 01:27:30.470
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the optimism.</v>

2146
01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.300
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't look like we're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>substantive tax reform the most.</v>

2147
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get our tax cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're not going to get a real reform</v>

2148
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 4>that's going to cause a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 4>economic growth.</v>

2149
01:27:40.971 --> 01:27:44.060
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to get bigger deficits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to lower taxes,</v>

2150
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.160
<v Speaker 4>but we're not going to reduce government</v>
<v Speaker 4>spending.</v>

2151
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.240
<v Speaker 4>And the real sad part is no one is</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about making government smaller.</v>

2152
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to talk about tax cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2153
01:27:52.971 --> 01:27:56.630
<v Speaker 4>well taxes to support government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you want lower taxes,</v>

2154
01:27:56.631 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 4>you need a smaller government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I want both,</v>

2155
01:27:58.671 --> 01:28:00.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want lower taxes.</v>

2156
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not naive enough to think I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>have big government with lower taxes</v>

2157
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 4>because that just means bigger deficits</v>
<v Speaker 4>and deficits are a worst way to pay for</v>

2158
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 4>government and taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you decide that you want to have</v>

2159
01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:13.940
<v Speaker 4>big government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you better have high taxes to pay</v>

2160
01:28:13.941 --> 01:28:15.440
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know who's going to bear the</v>

2161
01:28:15.441 --> 01:28:16.040
<v Speaker 4>brunt of that?</v>

2162
01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.500
<v Speaker 4>The middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if the middleclass wants big</v>

2163
01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:20.270
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want lots of entitlements,</v>

2164
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 4>then they're going to pay through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nose.</v>

2165
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.510
<v Speaker 4>But someone has to be honest and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2166
01:28:23.511 --> 01:28:26.480
<v Speaker 4>if you don't want high taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we got to shrink government.</v>

2167
01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:28.670
<v Speaker 4>But they're talking about making</v>
<v Speaker 4>government bigger.</v>

2168
01:28:28.730 --> 01:28:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump is talking about let's spend more</v>

2169
01:28:30.381 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 4>money on infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's that money gonna come from?</v>

2170
01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 4>We're going to cut taxes and spend more</v>
<v Speaker 4>money on infrastructure.</v>

2171
01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to make ourselves rich</v>

2172
01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:39.980
<v Speaker 4>by spending money on infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2173
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:45.070
<v Speaker 4>what happened with the Republicans that</v>
<v Speaker 4>voted against obamacare and now vote</v>

2174
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:49.190
<v Speaker 4>against repealing Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2175
01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:50.750
<v Speaker 4>they're the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2176
01:28:50.751 --> 01:28:53.100
<v Speaker 4>And what is wrong with trump's ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2177
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:54.650
<v Speaker 4>for a stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those Republicans,</v>

2178
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.210
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are hypocrites.</v>

2179
01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 4>They only voted to repeal obamacare</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they knew Obama would veto it,</v>

2180
01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was easy to grandstand.</v>

2181
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's repeal it.</v>

2182
01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 4>And it was a good talking point to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>elected,</v>

2183
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.900
<v Speaker 4>but the minute they got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were too afraid to actually stand</v>

2184
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:13.050
<v Speaker 4>on that principle because they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to tell somebody that you can't buy</v>

2185
01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 4>insurance when you're sick for the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>prices when you're healthy.</v>

2186
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wanted to take away that free</v>

2187
01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:20.890
<v Speaker 4>lunch that had been served up by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

2188
01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.640
<v Speaker 4>by the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the Republicans wanted to do is</v>

2189
01:29:23.641 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 4>rebrand the free lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to continue to serve it,</v>

2190
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.140
<v Speaker 4>but take credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2191
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:31.020
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to make it trump care or</v>
<v Speaker 4>ryan care.</v>

2192
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even like this whole idea.</v>

2193
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.890
<v Speaker 4>Let's repeal and replace repeal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't replace with anything.</v>

2194
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:41.280
<v Speaker 4>Replace it with the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to get rid of obamacare</v>

2195
01:29:41.281 --> 01:29:43.320
<v Speaker 4>and replace it with something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost the same.</v>

2196
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 4>It's what was the idea of replacing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the first place?</v>

2197
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is,</v>

2198
01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:49.410
<v Speaker 4>it's all politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The benefit was they tried to keep the</v>

2199
01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 4>ban on preexisting conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which voters liked,</v>

2200
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 4>but get rid of the taxes and mandates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they didn't.</v>

2201
01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 4>But the two are intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have one without the other.</v>

2202
01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.800
<v Speaker 4>So that people liked the ban on</v>
<v Speaker 4>preexisting conditions because they want</v>

2203
01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:02.550
<v Speaker 4>to know that they're covered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they've,</v>

2204
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:04.110
<v Speaker 4>if they're going in there and they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>

2205
01:30:04.111 --> 01:30:05.430
<v Speaker 4>they could still get covered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2206
01:30:05.431 --> 01:30:07.680
<v Speaker 4>But then no one's going to buy coverage</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they don't need it.</v>

2207
01:30:07.681 --> 01:30:09.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just cannot use what happens to</v>

2208
01:30:09.271 --> 01:30:12.150
<v Speaker 4>those people that do have cancer and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these different diseases.</v>

2209
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.060
<v Speaker 4>If we don't have universal socialist</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare,</v>

2210
01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.130
<v Speaker 4>how do we do this to the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens once they have the,</v>

2211
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them have to buy the insurance</v>
<v Speaker 4>before they get the cancer,</v>

2212
01:30:20.941 --> 01:30:21.760
<v Speaker 4>when they're still healthy.</v>

2213
01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2214
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:24.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't have cancer right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2215
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:27.630
<v Speaker 4>I may get it next year in two or three</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2216
01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:29.370
<v Speaker 4>So I have health insurance now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2217
01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I get cancer,</v>

2218
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:34.310
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm covered that that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a successful guy.</v>

2219
01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:37.470
<v Speaker 4>But what about someone who's not even in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bad position?</v>

2220
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't have to be that</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful to be able to afford in a</v>

2221
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:42.990
<v Speaker 4>free market to buy herself some</v>
<v Speaker 4>coverage.</v>

2222
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:46.320
<v Speaker 4>The question is what do you do with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>person who made the mistake of not</v>

2223
01:30:46.321 --> 01:30:49.290
<v Speaker 4>buying insurance when they were healthy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now they get sick?</v>

2224
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.940
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you're sick,</v>

2225
01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 4>you can't expect an insurance company to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sell you a policy because the insurance</v>

2226
01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 4>company is trying to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They only sell policies to people who</v>

2227
01:30:58.201 --> 01:30:59.850
<v Speaker 4>they don't think we're going to put in</v>
<v Speaker 4>claims.</v>

2228
01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:03.000
<v Speaker 4>So you can't go to an insurance company</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're already sick and say,</v>

2229
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 4>sell me a policy.</v>

2230
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.790
<v Speaker 4>What's in it for the insurance company?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2231
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.410
<v Speaker 4>So now you've got to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2232
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:08.880
<v Speaker 4>how do you take care of that person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2233
01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best thing is to make sure that</v>

2234
01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:13.530
<v Speaker 4>person buys the insurance policy while</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still healthy.</v>

2235
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.880
<v Speaker 4>So that means you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

2236
01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.180
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the ban against</v>
<v Speaker 4>preexisting conditions and you allow</v>

2237
01:31:18.181 --> 01:31:22.140
<v Speaker 4>insurance companies to sell inexpensive</v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance that doesn't cover a sex</v>

2238
01:31:22.141 --> 01:31:24.980
<v Speaker 4>change operation or drug abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2239
01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:27.560
<v Speaker 4>Dario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's Transphobic Cape.</v>

2240
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.080
<v Speaker 4>If you just want to buy insurance that</v>
<v Speaker 4>covers like cancer,</v>

2241
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're 20 or 30 years old,</v>

2242
01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:34.530
<v Speaker 4>that's cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very inexpensive.</v>

2243
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:37.710
<v Speaker 4>It's all this other crap that they want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to mandate that makes it so expensive.</v>

2244
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.630
<v Speaker 4>But if you get a search of a situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>where for whatever reason somebody had</v>

2245
01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:45.210
<v Speaker 4>no insurance and they have no money and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now they get cancer,</v>

2246
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:46.620
<v Speaker 4>well that's what charities are for.</v>

2247
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.510
<v Speaker 4>People donate money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hospitals,</v>

2248
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 4>if doctors didn't have to spend so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>time on paperwork and filling out</v>

2249
01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:55.530
<v Speaker 4>insurance forms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have more time to donate.</v>

2250
01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and years ago,</v>

2251
01:31:56.911 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 4>doctors used to give a lot of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>spare time and of course that was before</v>

2252
01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 4>they had the income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2253
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:05.620
<v Speaker 4>when the doctors didn't have to pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>income taxes and when the doctors didn't</v>

2254
01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 4>have to deal with insurance companies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a lot of free time to help a</v>

2255
01:32:08.951 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 4>lot of poor people for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And doctors like doing that.</v>

2256
01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Doctors get a lot of satisfaction from</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping people.</v>

2257
01:32:14.441 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reason that so many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people become doctors.</v>

2258
01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 4>It's a very rewarding occupation when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a doctor.</v>

2259
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is lucrative and you can make money.</v>

2260
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 4>But doctors also enjoy helping people</v>
<v Speaker 4>for free.</v>

2261
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.450
<v Speaker 4>The problem is they can't even afford to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it now because there's all their time</v>

2262
01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:29.350
<v Speaker 4>is spent doing other stuff.</v>

2263
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.490
<v Speaker 4>They're also saddled down by malpractice</v>
<v Speaker 4>insurance and they also have extreme</v>

2264
01:32:33.491 --> 01:32:35.980
<v Speaker 4>amounts of medical school debt that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to handle.</v>

2265
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Yet they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be that expensive to go to</v>

2266
01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 4>medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wouldn't be if it was a free</v>

2267
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.050
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yes,</v>

2268
01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 4>if we had tort reform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you couldn't sue,</v>

2269
01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:44.733
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>

2270
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 4>you know I'm staying here in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a friend of mine's house,</v>

2271
01:32:47.741 --> 01:32:49.360
<v Speaker 4>he lives in Beverly Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went to high school together,</v>

2272
01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so he's in real estate.</v>

2273
01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:55.120
<v Speaker 4>He owns a lot of property and one of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>tenants is starbucks,</v>

2274
01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Starbucks restaurant.</v>

2275
01:32:56.261 --> 01:33:01.261
<v Speaker 4>And they just got sued and the person is</v>
<v Speaker 4>suing him as well because he's the</v>

2276
01:33:01.991 --> 01:33:04.330
<v Speaker 4>landlord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is the circumstance and this is,</v>

2277
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:06.430
<v Speaker 4>this is America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a guy,</v>

2278
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:08.950
<v Speaker 4>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess he's hard of hearing.</v>

2279
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:10.390
<v Speaker 4>He's not totally deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has,</v>

2280
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 4>he just has a hearing problem.</v>

2281
01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.670
<v Speaker 4>And so he goes into the starbucks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the starbucks is playing music right</v>

2282
01:33:15.671 --> 01:33:16.001
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2283
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:17.740
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have background music on and the</v>

2284
01:33:17.741 --> 01:33:19.960
<v Speaker 4>starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he asked the guy behind the</v>

2285
01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:20.561
<v Speaker 4>counter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2286
01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.270
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hard of hearing.</v>

2287
01:33:22.271 --> 01:33:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Do you have this special device that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can wear while I'm in here so that while</v>

2288
01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm in this restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can enjoy the same music as everybody</v>

2289
01:33:29.801 --> 01:33:31.540
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guy said,</v>

2290
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:31.841
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2291
01:33:31.841 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 4>we don't have that device.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2292
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:35.860
<v Speaker 4>he sued for $10,000 plus attorney's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fees.</v>

2293
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 4>And now he's suing my friend too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's the landlord of were where</v>

2294
01:33:39.791 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 4>the starbucks restaurant is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is America.</v>

2295
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you walk,</v>

2296
01:33:44.211 --> 01:33:48.670
<v Speaker 4>that's a hilarious lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You walk into a restaurant and you have</v>

2297
01:33:48.671 --> 01:33:50.620
<v Speaker 4>a hearing problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get yourself a hearing aid.</v>

2298
01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Don't force the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these are the regulations.</v>

2299
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>These are the lawsuits.</v>

2300
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.290
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Americans with disabilities act is</v>

2301
01:33:56.291 --> 01:33:58.270
<v Speaker 4>the most ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2302
01:33:58.330 --> 01:33:59.410
<v Speaker 4>know I remember what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2303
01:33:59.411 --> 01:34:00.970
<v Speaker 4>in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a true story.</v>

2304
01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:02.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can google this.</v>

2305
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.150
<v Speaker 4>There was a strip club here in southern</v>
<v Speaker 4>California and I guess their,</v>

2306
01:34:07.151 --> 01:34:10.540
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their thing was they had a shower on the</v>

2307
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 4>stage and so the stripper would strip in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shower so you can watch her,</v>

2308
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:15.574
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the water.</v>

2309
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:17.320
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a big pole,</v>

2310
01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:18.213
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>

2311
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.730
<v Speaker 4>the shower was up in the air and you had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to climb up the pole to get to the</v>

2312
01:34:21.731 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 4>shower and then you do your strippers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd strip,</v>

2313
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:26.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government made them shut that down.</v>

2314
01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:31.480
<v Speaker 4>And it was because it was discriminatory</v>
<v Speaker 4>against strippers in wheelchairs because</v>

2315
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:34.630
<v Speaker 4>there was no way for a stripper in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheelchair to climb up the pole.</v>

2316
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never even seen a stripper in a</v>

2317
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:38.330
<v Speaker 4>wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that I'd spent a lot of time in</v>

2318
01:34:38.331 --> 01:34:39.820
<v Speaker 4>strip clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2319
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:42.280
<v Speaker 4>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where we are as a society,</v>

2320
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.510
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were saying you,</v>

2321
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a stripper can't go on that pole,</v>

2322
01:34:46.151 --> 01:34:48.190
<v Speaker 4>then nobody can go on that pole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2323
01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Or if a stripper that's in a wheelchair</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't go on the,</v>

2324
01:34:50.670 --> 01:34:51.370
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2325
01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

2326
01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:52.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2327
01:34:52.581 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all these laws and regs,</v>

2328
01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.140
<v Speaker 4>it's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody is suing everybody because the</v>

2329
01:34:57.141 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>government creates all these</v>

2330
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 2>phony rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2331
01:34:59.271 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 2>just because I'm hard of hearing doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean the whole world has to accommodate</v>

2332
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:07.100
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I'm hard to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes people will say,</v>

2333
01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:09.590
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I happen to have a size 14</v>

2334
01:35:09.591 --> 01:35:10.490
<v Speaker 2>shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2335
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I have a really big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean that every shoe store</v>

2336
01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to stock a size 14 just,</v>

2337
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.840
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause they know that barely</v>

2338
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:19.910
<v Speaker 2>anybody is going to have a size 14 so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want,</v>

2339
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.850
<v Speaker 2>but I go to the big and tall store</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know they're going to have a</v>

2340
01:35:22.851 --> 01:35:26.330
<v Speaker 2>size 14 so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be certain businesses</v>

2341
01:35:26.331 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 2>that are going to cater to people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>handicaps.</v>

2342
01:35:29.481 --> 01:35:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all these hotels and motels</v>

2343
01:35:31.701 --> 01:35:34.640
<v Speaker 2>that have to shut down their swimming</v>
<v Speaker 2>pools because they can't afford the</v>

2344
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:38.600
<v Speaker 2>money to have a lift so that somebody in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wheelchair can go into that swimming</v>

2345
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

2346
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does every single swimming pool in</v>

2347
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 2>the country have to accommodate somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a wheelchair?</v>

2348
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Why can't people who have wheelchairs go</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet and find out which hope,</v>

2349
01:35:47.301 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 2>which hotels are catering to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular clientele and just go there.</v>

2350
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.520
<v Speaker 2>But when you force everybody to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing miniature golf courses</v>

2351
01:35:55.521 --> 01:35:58.940
<v Speaker 2>are shutting down because they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to be accessible to</v>

2352
01:35:58.941 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 2>people in wheelchairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if no one in the wheelchair has</v>

2353
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:03.890
<v Speaker 2>ever tried to play that course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they end up having to shut it</v>

2354
01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:06.080
<v Speaker 2>down because they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2355
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2356
01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.661
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

2357
01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I used to go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to this beach here in,</v>

2358
01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:11.911
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2359
01:36:11.911 --> 01:36:13.700
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Malibu and I was younger living here.</v>

2360
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:16.610
<v Speaker 2>And in order to get to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:17.990
<v Speaker 2>you had to walk down like a cliff.</v>

2362
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It was like a dog beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forget the name of it,</v>

2363
01:36:19.701 --> 01:36:21.770
<v Speaker 2>but there was no stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to kind of walk down this cliff.</v>

2364
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:25.790
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the very front there were like three</v>

2365
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:28.220
<v Speaker 2>or four handicap parking spaces that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were never filled.</v>

2366
01:36:28.221 --> 01:36:31.250
<v Speaker 2>They were always empty and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would have to park on pch cause</v>

2367
01:36:31.251 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 2>the parking lot would get phil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nobody would ever use the handicap</v>

2368
01:36:34.401 --> 01:36:37.730
<v Speaker 2>spots because nobody who was handicapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly get down to that beach</v>

2369
01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 2>yet they had to have those spots there</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

2370
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:41.360
<v Speaker 2>It had to have those spots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have to have some sort</v>

2371
01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:43.880
<v Speaker 2>of a real access to cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cause that's nature.</v>

2372
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a beach that no one,</v>

2373
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:48.290
<v Speaker 2>no one who is handicapped could ever go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2374
01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:50.750
<v Speaker 2>But yet they had to have all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these spots there.</v>

2375
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Like you could take that to Yosemite and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

2376
01:36:52.881 --> 01:36:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to climb this mountain,</v>

2377
01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 2>you have to have use of your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to have to figure out</v>

2378
01:36:56.841 --> 01:37:00.690
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a handicapped access up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of this mountain and is</v>

2379
01:37:00.691 --> 01:37:02.930
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is where all the government,</v>

2380
01:37:02.931 --> 01:37:04.550
<v Speaker 2>the government thinks they're being</v>
<v Speaker 2>charitable.</v>

2381
01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I feel bad that people have</v>

2382
01:37:06.531 --> 01:37:08.000
<v Speaker 2>handicaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are poor of course,</v>

2383
01:37:08.001 --> 01:37:11.000
<v Speaker 2>but that the solution is not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans disabilities act.</v>

2384
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of employers now that</v>

2385
01:37:13.341 --> 01:37:16.640
<v Speaker 2>won't hire people with handicaps because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now so expensive.</v>

2386
01:37:16.641 --> 01:37:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Whereas they would have done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2387
01:37:18.411 --> 01:37:20.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2388
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.010
<v Speaker 2>these antidiscrimination laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2389
01:37:22.011 --> 01:37:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't discriminate based on gender,</v>

2390
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.880
<v Speaker 2>based on sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on,</v>

2391
01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:26.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2392
01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:27.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2393
01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual identity and all these different</v>

2394
01:37:29.631 --> 01:37:30.291
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2395
01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:32.780
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually more discrimination.</v>

2396
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:34.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are actually employers now who</v>

2397
01:37:34.551 --> 01:37:37.700
<v Speaker 2>aren't racist at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who will go out of their way not to</v>

2398
01:37:37.701 --> 01:37:40.100
<v Speaker 2>hire minorities because they're afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting sued,</v>

2399
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.821
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2400
01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:45.821
<v Speaker 2>if I hire a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black eye or if I hire a Hispanic or</v>

2401
01:37:45.831 --> 01:37:48.800
<v Speaker 2>if I hire a homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I fire that person because</v>

2402
01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:50.900
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing a good job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could sue me.</v>

2403
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.561
<v Speaker 2>They could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2404
01:37:51.561 --> 01:37:55.130
<v Speaker 2>you fired me because I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean about women in tech.</v>

2405
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I heard this argument</v>

2406
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.760
<v Speaker 3>recently because I was reading some</v>
<v Speaker 3>article written by Ellen Pao.</v>

2407
01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:01.290
<v Speaker 3>She was that woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2408
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:04.290
<v Speaker 3>had that big lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual discrimination lawsuit.</v>

2409
01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:08.700
<v Speaker 3>She said some article about women in</v>
<v Speaker 3>tech and someone was saying,</v>

2410
01:38:08.701 --> 01:38:09.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see this,</v>

2411
01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 3>this is the reason why people don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hire women in the first place.</v>

2412
01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:16.320
<v Speaker 3>But it isn't that sort of a slippery</v>
<v Speaker 3>slope because if she really was being</v>

2413
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:18.300
<v Speaker 3>sexually discriminated against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2414
01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't really be able to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first place.</v>

2415
01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 3>If he's saying is true that they create</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hostile work environment for women,</v>

2416
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:29.040
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't be able to necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>just never hire women,</v>

2417
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 3>just so they can remind here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hostile.</v>

2418
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

2419
01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:34.860
<v Speaker 4>Remember if you have a business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2420
01:38:34.861 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they always sue the business.</v>

2421
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say one of my male employees</v>

2422
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 4>harass us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my female employee,</v>

2423
01:38:40.711 --> 01:38:43.950
<v Speaker 4>they don't say that one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the owner.</v>

2424
01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is how it works against him.</v>

2425
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:49.020
<v Speaker 4>So more profitable because the owner has</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the money,</v>

2426
01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:49.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2427
01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:50.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2428
01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.060
<v Speaker 4>so here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I am an owner of a business and now</v>

2429
01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 4>some woman walks in and let's say she is</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly attractive.</v>

2430
01:38:58.831 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 4>And I start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2431
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 4>do I really want to have this potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuit walking around my office?</v>

2432
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.270
<v Speaker 4>Do I really want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because maybe she really does get</v>

2433
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 4>harassed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm the one that's liable for that</v>

2434
01:39:08.551 --> 01:39:09.460
<v Speaker 4>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2435
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.330
<v Speaker 4>And I can have all the policies I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2436
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:13.860
<v Speaker 4>guys are horny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2437
01:39:13.861 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 4>we know what we're like and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2438
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:17.820
<v Speaker 4>you dangled lump me in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

2439
01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.420
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well dairy,</v>

2440
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:23.340
<v Speaker 4>but I mean 10 pete employers don't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuits.</v>

2441
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2442
01:39:24.321 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 4>and so the easier you make it to sue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the less likely you're going to get a</v>

2443
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:30.290
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if employers are looking at,</v>

2444
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I want to hire the person who's least</v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to sue me,</v>

2445
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:35.130
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the harder you make it to sue,</v>

2446
01:39:35.131 --> 01:39:37.000
<v Speaker 3>the more likely people are going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>harassed?</v>

2447
01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.433
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2448
01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.530
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody has harassed and sue the</v>

2449
01:39:41.531 --> 01:39:44.110
<v Speaker 4>person that harassed you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't sue the person who happened to</v>

2450
01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:46.120
<v Speaker 4>employ him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might've had nothing to do with it.</v>

2451
01:39:46.121 --> 01:39:47.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So don't sue you,</v>

2452
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:50.570
<v Speaker 3>the individual that causes whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue is.</v>

2453
01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:51.161
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2454
01:39:51.161 --> 01:39:52.330
<v Speaker 4>it's gotta be a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't,</v>

2455
01:39:52.331 --> 01:39:54.820
<v Speaker 4>you can't just say the employer and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

2456
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:56.980
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination,</v>

2457
01:39:56.981 --> 01:39:58.180
<v Speaker 4>like see I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2458
01:39:58.210 --> 01:40:01.120
<v Speaker 4>So maybe it's easier if I just talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Jews versus something else.</v>

2459
01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:03.940
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say somebody doesn't want to</v>

2460
01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:07.720
<v Speaker 4>hire me because I'm Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I support their decision.</v>

2461
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.240
<v Speaker 4>They have a right not to like me and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2462
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:13.630
<v Speaker 4>no one has to like Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know not everybody does.</v>

2463
01:40:13.631 --> 01:40:17.680
<v Speaker 4>And if somebody is an anti-semite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's their right to be that,</v>

2464
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they want to fire me because I'm</v>

2465
01:40:19.571 --> 01:40:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can do that.</v>

2466
01:40:20.591 --> 01:40:21.850
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to hire me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2467
01:40:21.851 --> 01:40:24.910
<v Speaker 4>if somebody wants to have a restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they want to put a sign that says no</v>

2468
01:40:24.911 --> 01:40:27.070
<v Speaker 4>juice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's there right now.</v>

2469
01:40:27.071 --> 01:40:28.600
<v Speaker 4>I think anybody that eats there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2470
01:40:28.601 --> 01:40:31.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they got a problem because look,</v>

2471
01:40:31.121 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not black.</v>

2472
01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:35.410
<v Speaker 4>If there was a restaurant that had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sign that said no blacks,</v>

2473
01:40:35.411 --> 01:40:38.160
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I would eat there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just out of principle of effects.</v>

2474
01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.200
<v Speaker 4>I think if there's somebody that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Jews,</v>

2475
01:40:41.410 --> 01:40:44.020
<v Speaker 4>the last thing they're going to do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>put that sign out there because you know</v>

2476
01:40:44.021 --> 01:40:45.520
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want me to eat there.</v>

2477
01:40:45.521 --> 01:40:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Even though they don't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want my money.</v>

2478
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:50.620
<v Speaker 4>And they also don't want the blow back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't want the bad public.</v>

2479
01:40:50.621 --> 01:40:52.450
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine like people keep people</v>
<v Speaker 4>say like,</v>

2480
01:40:52.451 --> 01:40:52.871
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2481
01:40:52.871 --> 01:40:54.700
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we don't have all these</v>

2482
01:40:54.701 --> 01:40:57.730
<v Speaker 4>antidiscrimination laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then restaurants aren't going to serve</v>

2483
01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:59.650
<v Speaker 4>blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You name me one.</v>

2484
01:40:59.651 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 4>Rhett,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find one restaurant in this country</v>

2485
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:05.050
<v Speaker 4>with the Internet that put out a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No blacks allowed.</v>

2486
01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be the end of that restaurant.</v>

2487
01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these laws were sort of</v>

2488
01:41:08.081 --> 01:41:10.790
<v Speaker 4>established before the Internet was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful force centers today.</v>

2489
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:11.261
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2490
01:41:11.261 --> 01:41:14.290
<v Speaker 4>But we can now see all a lot of the harm</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these,</v>

2491
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:16.360
<v Speaker 4>these laws have done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you go back,</v>

2492
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 4>you go back before all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>antidiscrimination laws up,</v>

2493
01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:24.640
<v Speaker 4>black teenage unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say in the 30s was lower than</v>

2494
01:41:24.641 --> 01:41:26.770
<v Speaker 4>white teenage unemployment lower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2495
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:29.980
<v Speaker 4>do you think we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're more racist today than we were</v>

2496
01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:30.731
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2497
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 4>we're not more racist or less racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's all these laws that have</v>

2498
01:41:34.091 --> 01:41:34.990
<v Speaker 4>backfired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these,</v>

2499
01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2500
01:41:35.891 --> 01:41:37.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antidiscrimination laws and you know,</v>

2501
01:41:37.931 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 4>you have this whole industry like</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently,</v>

2502
01:41:39.851 --> 01:41:40.541
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2503
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:44.260
<v Speaker 4>you have this big movement because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>had the riots in Charlottesville because</v>

2504
01:41:44.261 --> 01:41:46.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to take down these statues,</v>

2505
01:41:46.151 --> 01:41:50.230
<v Speaker 4>these confederate statues as if those</v>
<v Speaker 4>confederate statues are the reason that</v>

2506
01:41:50.231 --> 01:41:54.030
<v Speaker 4>we have poverty and unemployment and</v>
<v Speaker 4>crime in African American communities.</v>

2507
01:41:54.031 --> 01:41:56.410
<v Speaker 4>These statues have nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and taking them down.</v>

2508
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Is it going to change anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you've got these people in America</v>

2509
01:41:59.231 --> 01:42:04.000
<v Speaker 4>that make a living off of poverty and</v>
<v Speaker 4>off of race baiting that want to say,</v>

2510
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:05.530
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that you're poor,</v>

2511
01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.580
<v Speaker 4>the reason that there's crime is because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of racism and the racism is because of</v>

2512
01:42:09.581 --> 01:42:11.230
<v Speaker 4>these statutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So vote for me,</v>

2513
01:42:11.231 --> 01:42:15.700
<v Speaker 4>give me money and I will help you write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a victim and I am your solution.</v>

2514
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:16.480
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

2515
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.130
<v Speaker 4>they act well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll just get rid of the statute</v>

2516
01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.720
<v Speaker 4>because even if they get rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>statues,</v>

2517
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 4>nothing's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they have to get rid of something</v>

2518
01:42:21.611 --> 01:42:22.440
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

2519
01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that the statute to her for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people represents racism.</v>

2520
01:42:26.251 --> 01:42:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Like if you see a Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee statue and then you read about what</v>

2521
01:42:29.251 --> 01:42:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee did to his own personal slaves and</v>

2522
01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:35.080
<v Speaker 3>oversaw some of the lashings and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2523
01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.460
<v Speaker 3>in caught slaves that were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>escape as a horrible account.</v>

2524
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.390
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted recently of some slave that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

2525
01:42:42.391 --> 01:42:44.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught while I was trying to escape.</v>

2526
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>

2527
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee oversaw that beating him and lashing</v>

2528
01:42:48.331 --> 01:42:48.800
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2529
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2530
01:42:49.281 --> 01:42:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all of the various stories of,</v>

2531
01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:54.200
<v Speaker 4>I know that Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee was a very well respected guy,</v>

2532
01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:55.970
<v Speaker 4>even in the north.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was very,</v>

2533
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:58.820
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lincoln wanted him to run the union</v>

2534
01:42:58.821 --> 01:43:00.350
<v Speaker 4>army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he turned it down because he</v>

2535
01:43:00.351 --> 01:43:02.300
<v Speaker 4>couldn't because he was a good killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2536
01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.460
<v Speaker 4>well respected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2537
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.460
<v Speaker 4>it was a good general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a war hero in these American</v>

2538
01:43:07.461 --> 01:43:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also a slave owner.</v>

2539
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a lot of people,</v>

2540
01:43:10.011 --> 01:43:12.290
<v Speaker 4>so it was Thomas Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was George Washington.</v>

2541
01:43:12.291 --> 01:43:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people go for Neri though,</v>

2542
01:43:13.611 --> 01:43:14.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2543
01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Thomas Jefferson were alive today,</v>

2544
01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:18.950
<v Speaker 4>he would not own slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

2545
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you or I were born in the</v>

2546
01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Annabella south,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was born in Virginia in 1750 would</v>

2547
01:43:27.831 --> 01:43:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I feel differently about slavery that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>do today?</v>

2548
01:43:29.901 --> 01:43:32.690
<v Speaker 4>There's a good chance that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was the culture slavery had</v>

2549
01:43:32.691 --> 01:43:35.300
<v Speaker 4>been going on for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like we invented it,</v>

2550
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:36.080
<v Speaker 4>so it was horrific.</v>

2551
01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Good is that is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're being very honest.</v>

2552
01:43:38.461 --> 01:43:40.760
<v Speaker 3>I think you're being very pragmatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>

2553
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 4>my point is that most people that even</v>
<v Speaker 4>see a statue of Robert E.</v>

2554
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Lee don't even know who Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee was.</v>

2555
01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 4>The average American doesn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 4>who fought in the civil war,</v>

2556
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 4>let alone who want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2557
01:43:51.501 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 4>thanks to American</v>

2558
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think those statues,</v>

2559
01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:57.530
<v Speaker 2>those statues have been there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked.</v>

2560
01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther King never cared about</v>
<v Speaker 2>those statues.</v>

2561
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:02.150
<v Speaker 2>He didn't march down and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get rid of the statutes.</v>

2562
01:44:02.151 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you know in a lot of those statues</v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually put up.</v>

2563
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them were put up during the</v>

2564
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 2>civil rights era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were put up because people were</v>

2565
01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 2>fighting against all the racists and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>pete,</v>

2566
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walls were put up.</v>

2567
01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:14.870
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2568
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:19.870
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them were put up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>90019101920 I mean the southsea spike,</v>

2569
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a spike in these civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>war monuments going up and they're</v>

2570
01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:27.230
<v Speaker 2>actually fairly cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaply made,</v>

2571
01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bronze statues that were cheaper to</v>

2572
01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:33.770
<v Speaker 2>produce that were made during the civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights era and direct protest to the</v>

2573
01:44:33.771 --> 01:44:34.790
<v Speaker 2>civil rights era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2574
01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:38.680
<v Speaker 2>They made up these statues of guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>grows when they forget to represented</v>

2575
01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>

2576
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:42.530
<v Speaker 2>The people who were leading the anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement were all the</v>

2577
01:44:42.531 --> 01:44:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2578
01:44:43.401 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Even though lb a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2579
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.681
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2580
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 2>this is dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is when they passed it.</v>

2581
01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 2>When they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they pass the civil rights act,</v>

2582
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 2>1964 it was only because of Republicans</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had passed.</v>

2583
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:55.670
<v Speaker 2>If the Republicans had voted for it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same proportion and Democrats,</v>

2584
01:44:55.671 --> 01:44:59.150
<v Speaker 2>it would have been defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that the part of the Civil Rights</v>

2585
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Act that I was against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2586
01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:02.040
<v Speaker 2>And I obviously I was a little kid then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was,</v>

2587
01:45:02.041 --> 01:45:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in 1963 so I'm just looking</v>

2588
01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:05.264
<v Speaker 2>back at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2589
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:10.070
<v Speaker 2>That all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antidiscrimination laws that had to</v>

2590
01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 2>do with government and the state</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>

2591
01:45:11.841 --> 01:45:15.200
<v Speaker 2>because you had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized racism down South by</v>

2592
01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2593
01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.430
<v Speaker 2>And all that was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that we eradicated was</v>

2594
01:45:19.431 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2595
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:24.440
<v Speaker 2>The part that was bad is the part that</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the private realm and said,</v>

2596
01:45:24.441 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 2>if you are a private person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't discriminate because now all</v>

2597
01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden the government is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought police.</v>

2598
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2599
01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.370
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every decision that everybody makes is</v>

2600
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:37.010
<v Speaker 2>being second guessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've opened up everybody to all sorts</v>

2601
01:45:37.011 --> 01:45:40.340
<v Speaker 2>of lawsuits and you've gotten blow back</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2602
01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses are afraid to hire people not</v>

2603
01:45:43.071 --> 01:45:45.260
<v Speaker 2>because they're racist or bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because they don't,</v>

2604
01:45:45.261 --> 01:45:48.770
<v Speaker 2>they fear a lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now you've increased the cost of</v>

2605
01:45:48.771 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 2>employing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2606
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.930
<v Speaker 2>people that are in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these specialized groups.</v>

2607
01:45:52.931 --> 01:45:55.850
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that was a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also I think legally,</v>

2608
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutionally has the right to tell</v>

2609
01:45:59.451 --> 01:45:59.841
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2610
01:45:59.841 --> 01:46:02.660
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if somebody tried to tell me as a,</v>

2611
01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.580
<v Speaker 2>in my private life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2612
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:05.510
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2613
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.210
<v Speaker 2>you need to be an equal opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 2>dater,</v>

2614
01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2615
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:09.760
<v Speaker 2>All the women that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2616
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:10.151
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2617
01:46:10.151 --> 01:46:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you can't just date white women or</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing this argument.</v>

2618
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2619
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.823
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2620
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:17.030
<v Speaker 2>even as an employee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2621
01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:18.860
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I'm Jewish,</v>

2622
01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 2>if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2623
01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to work for another Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like working for Jews and I go</v>

2624
01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:26.260
<v Speaker 2>and I apply for jobs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2625
01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:26.901
<v Speaker 2>and I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2626
01:46:26.901 --> 01:46:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not Jewish.</v>

2627
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2628
01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 2>so I can discriminate as a worker among,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can quit.</v>

2629
01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I can go to my employer and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2630
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of working for a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit.</v>

2631
01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's legal.</v>

2632
01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:42.320
<v Speaker 2>You can't sue me for discriminating</v>
<v Speaker 2>against you and going to work for my</v>

2633
01:46:42.321 --> 01:46:45.650
<v Speaker 2>competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look employers or are you don't lose</v>

2634
01:46:45.651 --> 01:46:47.390
<v Speaker 2>your rights because you create a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

2635
01:46:47.391 --> 01:46:49.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't lose your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

2636
01:46:49.171 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>let me interrupt you here,</v>

2637
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.290
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think there's a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between someone who makes a</v>

2638
01:46:52.291 --> 01:46:56.250
<v Speaker 3>personal decision of where they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work versus someone who has power over</v>

2639
01:46:56.251 --> 01:46:58.410
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference that she'd</v>

2640
01:46:58.411 --> 01:47:01.200
<v Speaker 3>someone who chooses like I don't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>working for this guy because a,</v>

2641
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 3>I only like working for white people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can decide to do that because it's</v>

2642
01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 3>your own personal choice to where to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not,</v>

2643
01:47:06.810 --> 01:47:08.580
<v Speaker 3>you're not holding any power over</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

2644
01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:12.150
<v Speaker 3>These laws are created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're antidiscrimination laws because</v>

2645
01:47:12.151 --> 01:47:15.600
<v Speaker 3>you're discriminating against other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you can keep other people</v>

2646
01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:16.590
<v Speaker 3>from making a living.</v>

2647
01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>employment is all about discrimination,</v>

2648
01:47:18.791 --> 01:47:20.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to find the best person for</v>

2649
01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:22.930
<v Speaker 4>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can discriminate based on all sorts of</v>

2650
01:47:22.931 --> 01:47:23.350
<v Speaker 4>factors,</v>

2651
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:25.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a one way to look at it.</v>

2652
01:47:25.230 --> 01:47:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Discrimination,</v>

2653
01:47:26.231 --> 01:47:27.970
<v Speaker 3>but you're being discerning more than a,</v>

2654
01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:29.270
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying,</v>

2655
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:31.370
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to discriminate based on</v>

2656
01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.700
<v Speaker 4>competence based on their background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically discrimination,</v>

2657
01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:39.620
<v Speaker 4>discrimination of the word though it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>still discriminating just means you're,</v>

2658
01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of picky,</v>

2659
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:41.181
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2660
01:47:41.181 --> 01:47:42.800
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about discriminating</v>

2661
01:47:42.801 --> 01:47:47.760
<v Speaker 4>based on a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're being racist or sexist or</v>

2662
01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.580
<v Speaker 4>homophobic being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being discriminating and racism are,</v>

2663
01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.970
<v Speaker 4>are different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2664
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:57.050
<v Speaker 4>Cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can discriminate based on race and</v>

2665
01:47:57.051 --> 01:47:59.930
<v Speaker 4>not be a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like let's say somebody decides,</v>

2666
01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:00.901
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2667
01:48:00.901 --> 01:48:02.600
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hire two candidates.</v>

2668
01:48:02.601 --> 01:48:05.000
<v Speaker 4>One is white and one is black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they say,</v>

2669
01:48:05.001 --> 01:48:06.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I hire the white candidate,</v>

2670
01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm less likely to get sued if I have to</v>

2671
01:48:09.921 --> 01:48:12.200
<v Speaker 4>terminate him because he's not doing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good job because he can't,</v>

2672
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:15.620
<v Speaker 4>he can't claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I make that decision based on</v>

2673
01:48:15.621 --> 01:48:17.030
<v Speaker 4>race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not because I'm a racist.</v>

2674
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:19.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to practically look at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers.</v>

2675
01:48:19.341 --> 01:48:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm not necessarily would disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would say that is a racist</v>

2676
01:48:22.041 --> 01:48:23.930
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're assuming that black people</v>

2677
01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:26.530
<v Speaker 4>would be more likely to sue you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they have that statistically,</v>

2678
01:48:26.531 --> 01:48:27.740
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can't,</v>

2679
01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:30.260
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I fire somebody who's white,</v>

2680
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:33.530
<v Speaker 4>they can't say you fired me because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>

2681
01:48:33.710 --> 01:48:35.270
<v Speaker 4>It's just never at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

2682
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:39.170
<v Speaker 4>So obviously there are plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuits for wrongful termination.</v>

2683
01:48:39.171 --> 01:48:41.810
<v Speaker 4>I've had them myself where somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

2684
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:46.600
<v Speaker 4>you sued me because I'm black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody is going to say you fuck you fire</v>

2685
01:48:46.601 --> 01:48:47.391
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it is,</v>

2686
01:48:47.391 --> 01:48:49.730
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a statistic,</v>

2687
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:53.240
<v Speaker 4>a statistic that somebody can consider,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean that they're an</v>

2688
01:48:53.241 --> 01:48:53.870
<v Speaker 4>actual</v>

2689
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:58.220
<v Speaker 3>fantastic or more black people or black</v>
<v Speaker 3>people or rather more likely to fire for</v>

2690
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.920
<v Speaker 3>sue for wrongful termination.</v>

2691
01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Black person is more likely to sue for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>racially based determination.</v>

2692
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Then somebody who's white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2693
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.200
<v Speaker 4>a women as a woman is more likely to sue</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she was discriminated based on</v>

2694
01:49:13.201 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 4>her sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A man is not likely to say,</v>

2695
01:49:15.001 --> 01:49:18.180
<v Speaker 4>you fired me because I'm a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to get someone saying</v>

2696
01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:20.570
<v Speaker 4>you fired me because I'm a woman because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a member of the,</v>

2697
01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:21.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a protected class.</v>

2698
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:24.600
<v Speaker 4>But if somebody makes a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that you're,</v>

2699
01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:25.720
<v Speaker 4>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2700
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:28.350
<v Speaker 4>anti women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're trying to make a rational</v>

2701
01:49:28.351 --> 01:49:31.710
<v Speaker 4>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the racism is just believing that one</v>

2702
01:49:31.711 --> 01:49:35.590
<v Speaker 4>race is inferior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just not liking somebody because cost</v>

2703
01:49:35.591 --> 01:49:37.170
<v Speaker 4>our member of particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's totally different.</v>

2704
01:49:37.890 --> 01:49:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Racial discrimination should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're thinking about the future of</v>

2705
01:49:41.611 --> 01:49:42.870
<v Speaker 3>your business and just hedging,</v>

2706
01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:43.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2707
01:49:43.371 --> 01:49:44.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2708
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.860
<v Speaker 4>I think it should be legal no matter</v>
<v Speaker 4>what.</v>

2709
01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elac I think have a right</v>

2710
01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.410
<v Speaker 2>to be assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2711
01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is though,</v>

2712
01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're a businessman and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're making your hiring decisions</v>

2713
01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.480
<v Speaker 2>based on the color of people's skin or</v>
<v Speaker 2>their gender,</v>

2714
01:49:58.810 --> 01:50:02.650
<v Speaker 2>and my competitors are making decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on competence,</v>

2715
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:04.540
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2716
01:50:04.541 --> 01:50:08.860
<v Speaker 2>if you are going to turn down a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>quality female worker and you're going</v>

2717
01:50:08.861 --> 01:50:11.230
<v Speaker 2>to settle for somebody who can't do the</v>
<v Speaker 2>job as well,</v>

2718
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:13.690
<v Speaker 2>because you want to hire a man that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2719
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be a successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>businessman.</v>

2720
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So I have my faith in the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That racism,</v>

2721
01:50:18.671 --> 01:50:19.840
<v Speaker 2>there is a cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2722
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:24.220
<v Speaker 2>When when you're a racist and you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a racist and business that costs</v>

2723
01:50:24.221 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

2724
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happens is,</v>

2725
01:50:27.311 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government tries to take the cost</v>

2726
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:30.220
<v Speaker 2>away from racism.</v>

2727
01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:30.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2728
01:50:30.761 --> 01:50:31.171
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2729
01:50:31.171 --> 01:50:33.910
<v Speaker 2>they tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to substitute laws and</v>

2730
01:50:33.911 --> 01:50:34.930
<v Speaker 2>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2731
01:50:34.931 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have the market punish the</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

2732
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let the market punish somebody who is</v>

2733
01:50:39.541 --> 01:50:43.150
<v Speaker 2>hiring people that are not competent for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the job,</v>

2734
01:50:43.151 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 2>but he's hiring them for some ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

2735
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversely,</v>

2736
01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.000
<v Speaker 2>what did you think about the Google</v>
<v Speaker 2>memo?</v>

2737
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about that memo was</v>

2738
01:50:51.371 --> 01:50:52.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gentleman that was fired,</v>

2739
01:50:52.871 --> 01:50:55.220
<v Speaker 2>what does his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Damore.</v>

2740
01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:56.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his name.</v>

2741
01:50:56.350 --> 01:51:00.670
<v Speaker 2>He was saying that Google was hiring</v>
<v Speaker 2>people based on whether or not they are</v>

2742
01:51:00.671 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 2>minorities and women regardless of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>competence.</v>

2743
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're discriminating on like</v>

2744
01:51:07.271 --> 01:51:12.070
<v Speaker 2>discriminating against straight white</v>
<v Speaker 2>males to pursue people that would give</v>

2745
01:51:12.071 --> 01:51:13.630
<v Speaker 2>them the appearance of diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2746
01:51:13.631 --> 01:51:14.560
<v Speaker 2>they're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2747
01:51:14.561 --> 01:51:15.041
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2748
01:51:15.041 --> 01:51:19.150
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to be more diverse and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and mainly the diversity that they're</v>

2749
01:51:19.151 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 2>going for is they mop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to hire more women and also</v>

2750
01:51:22.601 --> 01:51:23.230
<v Speaker 2>more minority.</v>

2751
01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too,</v>

2752
01:51:24.131 --> 01:51:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but I think his argument or his paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>was more focused on the gender,</v>

2753
01:51:27.521 --> 01:51:31.990
<v Speaker 2>but what he was trying to do is point</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that fact that fewer women are just</v>

2754
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:33.250
<v Speaker 2>in programming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2755
01:51:33.251 --> 01:51:35.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not interested in that pursuit</v>

2756
01:51:35.411 --> 01:51:36.700
<v Speaker 2>as much as men are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2757
01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:37.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2758
01:51:37.291 --> 01:51:38.620
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're hiring,</v>

2759
01:51:38.621 --> 01:51:40.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Google is hiring and they're trying</v>

2760
01:51:40.451 --> 01:51:42.280
<v Speaker 2>to get the very best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2761
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a much bigger pool of male</v>
<v Speaker 2>applicants for those jobs.</v>

2762
01:51:45.581 --> 01:51:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more competitive.</v>

2763
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:48.700
<v Speaker 2>And so he's making the point that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2764
01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:52.390
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to get a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>women in these jobs.</v>

2765
01:51:52.391 --> 01:51:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to just try to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>more diversity,</v>

2766
01:51:55.691 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to sacrifice the</v>
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>

2767
01:51:57.401 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that he's right.</v>

2768
01:51:58.961 --> 01:52:01.780
<v Speaker 2>But the interesting thing is he gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired for expressing that opinion.</v>

2769
01:52:01.810 --> 01:52:04.360
<v Speaker 2>And what's ironic is he suing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now look,</v>

2770
01:52:04.361 --> 01:52:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean look personally see personally I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that Google should be able to,</v>

2771
01:52:08.201 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 2>it's their company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if they want to fire</v>

2772
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:12.010
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be able to do that.</v>

2773
01:52:12.011 --> 01:52:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Now if he had a contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what kind of employment</v>

2774
01:52:14.531 --> 01:52:16.630
<v Speaker 2>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's an at will employee,</v>

2775
01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:19.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they should be able to terminate</v>

2776
01:52:19.061 --> 01:52:21.100
<v Speaker 2>them for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I think he should be able to</v>

2777
01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:23.410
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they were saying he was reinforcing</v>

2778
01:52:23.411 --> 01:52:26.920
<v Speaker 2>negative gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the main reason they publicly</v>

2779
01:52:26.921 --> 01:52:29.350
<v Speaker 2>stated that he was being fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

2780
01:52:29.351 --> 01:52:32.140
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows you how you know how low that</v>

2781
01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.160
<v Speaker 2>we fallen as a society that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to express your opinion</v>

2782
01:52:36.161 --> 01:52:40.290
<v Speaker 2>as long as it's the politically correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion and Google is afraid of the blow</v>

2783
01:52:40.291 --> 01:52:42.550
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I could still look if they think</v>

2784
01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 2>it's going to hurt their profits if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>think the way to make in America today</v>

2785
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 4>is to bow down on the altar of political</v>
<v Speaker 4>correctness and just pretend that things</v>

2786
01:52:50.001 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Speaker 4>that you know are true or not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2787
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my principals are consistent,</v>

2788
01:52:55.731 --> 01:52:59.090
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that they violate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably violated California labor</v>

2789
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:00.910
<v Speaker 4>law in the way they fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2790
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't like California labor law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2791
01:53:02.781 --> 01:53:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm an employer here in California and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like it.</v>

2792
01:53:05.121 --> 01:53:08.300
<v Speaker 4>And I would probably employ a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 4>people here if they didn't have the</v>

2793
01:53:08.301 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 4>labor law that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2794
01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:12.530
<v Speaker 4>but I'm consistent in my view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2795
01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:13.860
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2796
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:17.750
<v Speaker 4>I think it's terrible that they had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire him because if he had expressed the</v>

2797
01:53:17.751 --> 01:53:20.240
<v Speaker 4>exact opposite position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't have been a problem.</v>

2798
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just because he is basically saying</v>

2799
01:53:23.421 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2800
01:53:24.261 --> 01:53:27.620
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is it that you have to pretend that</v>

2801
01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 4>men and women are exactly the same in</v>
<v Speaker 4>all aspects of life?</v>

2802
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 4>That there's no difference in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary biology that men and women</v>

2803
01:53:37.251 --> 01:53:40.970
<v Speaker 4>didn't necessarily evolve in different</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways based on the roles that they</v>

2804
01:53:40.971 --> 01:53:41.990
<v Speaker 4>played,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2805
01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.960
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years ago or tens of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years ago.</v>

2806
01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:46.100
<v Speaker 4>And that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2807
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 4>there's something about maleness and</v>
<v Speaker 4>again it's not like obviously there are</v>

2808
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:51.710
<v Speaker 4>exceptions to the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2809
01:53:51.711 --> 01:53:55.040
<v Speaker 4>But in general the average man is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>

2810
01:53:55.041 --> 01:53:56.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be certain way,</v>

2811
01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 4>think ways that the average man is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be different than the average women.</v>

2812
01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:02.660
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe men just for whatever reason</v>

2813
01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:05.240
<v Speaker 4>go are going into program in computer</v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

2814
01:54:05.241 --> 01:54:07.460
<v Speaker 4>in greater numbers and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just going to happen.</v>

2815
01:54:07.461 --> 01:54:09.740
<v Speaker 4>That's just nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't try to pretend that doesn't</v>

2816
01:54:09.741 --> 01:54:11.900
<v Speaker 4>exist or a bad thing.</v>

2817
01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Mary Psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

2818
01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:17.840
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's been studied</v>
<v Speaker 3>because looking at human beings and the</v>

2819
01:54:17.841 --> 01:54:21.050
<v Speaker 3>choices they make based on their gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on their environment,</v>

2820
01:54:21.051 --> 01:54:25.820
<v Speaker 3>based on there's a host of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors to deny that it does seem.</v>

2821
01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2822
01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:27.401
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2823
01:54:27.401 --> 01:54:30.700
<v Speaker 4>no one's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously there are going to be examples</v>

2824
01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:33.130
<v Speaker 4>that don't fit that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that of course,</v>

2825
01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:36.990
<v Speaker 4>but there's always outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when we're looking at numbers in a,</v>

2826
01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:39.830
<v Speaker 4>in a job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at the totality,</v>

2827
01:54:39.831 --> 01:54:40.520
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2828
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.300
<v Speaker 4>and so if there's only 10%,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2829
01:54:43.301 --> 01:54:45.730
<v Speaker 4>women to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we need to make it 50,</v>

2830
01:54:45.731 --> 01:54:48.490
<v Speaker 4>50 because half the world is women is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2831
01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.150
<v Speaker 3>that's like if the UFC said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2832
01:54:51.151 --> 01:54:54.810
<v Speaker 3>we need more women fighters so we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fire some of the men that are</v>

2833
01:54:54.811 --> 01:54:58.710
<v Speaker 3>way better fighters and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hire more women fighters to make a more</v>

2834
01:54:58.711 --> 01:55:02.010
<v Speaker 3>diverse lineup even though there's way</v>
<v Speaker 3>less women interested in fighting.</v>

2835
01:55:02.050 --> 01:55:03.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that,</v>

2836
01:55:03.311 --> 01:55:04.540
<v Speaker 4>cause obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

2837
01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:06.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm amazed that they're even any women</v>

2838
01:55:06.611 --> 01:55:09.370
<v Speaker 4>really don't want to be fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean obviously there's going to be</v>

2839
01:55:09.371 --> 01:55:11.620
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the vast majority of women that I</v>

2840
01:55:11.621 --> 01:55:13.840
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might like watching other men</v>

2841
01:55:13.841 --> 01:55:15.760
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the last thing they want to do is</v>

2842
01:55:15.761 --> 01:55:19.330
<v Speaker 4>step in the ring because that's mostly a</v>
<v Speaker 4>masculine thing,</v>

2843
01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:21.960
<v Speaker 4>that type of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2844
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:24.670
<v Speaker 4>most women that that doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no women that want to do that.</v>

2845
01:55:24.671 --> 01:55:25.870
<v Speaker 4>Of course there's going to be women.</v>

2846
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:29.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a good example cause they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>outliers and when you're just looking at</v>

2847
01:55:29.421 --> 01:55:31.340
<v Speaker 3>it without any discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just looking at the,</v>

2848
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:35.690
<v Speaker 3>this pursuit and trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>which genders are more likely to enter</v>

2849
01:55:35.691 --> 01:55:38.090
<v Speaker 3>this pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's being a lumberjack or a</v>

2850
01:55:38.091 --> 01:55:39.540
<v Speaker 3>minor or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2851
01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you could say all the factors you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look.</v>

2852
01:55:41.481 --> 01:55:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're worried about</v>

2853
01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 3>discrimination of other men on the job.</v>

2854
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're worried about being</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually harassed me with a word about</v>

2855
01:55:46.351 --> 01:55:48.000
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever those factors are,</v>

2856
01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:51.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more women that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in other pursuits,</v>

2857
01:55:51.781 --> 01:55:53.680
<v Speaker 2>course nursing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

2858
01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 2>and then when the government comes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just says,</v>

2859
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.500
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the numbers are this and now we</v>

2860
01:55:58.501 --> 01:56:02.160
<v Speaker 2>have to fix this because this must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the result of discrimination.</v>

2861
01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's not,</v>

2862
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:07.260
<v Speaker 2>it's just the natural result of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting freely,</v>

2863
01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's also good people's response to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2864
01:56:09.451 --> 01:56:12.120
<v Speaker 2>They almost can't have a measured</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective response.</v>

2865
01:56:12.330 --> 01:56:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Like the woman who's the CEO of Youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that she was very hurt by that memo</v>

2866
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.380
<v Speaker 2>and that this guy was a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the credit memo.</v>

2867
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the fucking CEO of Youtube.</v>

2868
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Like she is like an example of a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can succeed.</v>

2869
01:56:26.791 --> 01:56:28.870
<v Speaker 2>It does succeed because she does have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the personnel.</v>

2870
01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:29.821
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2871
01:56:29.821 --> 01:56:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this idea when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm,</v>

2872
01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I was offended.</v>

2873
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:34.403
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2874
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.861
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2875
01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:36.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a right not to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>

2876
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:37.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2877
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:38.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a little sensitive.</v>

2878
01:56:38.611 --> 01:56:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a thicker skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2879
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.830
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna say things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>offend that,</v>

2880
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that are offensive to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean they don't have a</v>

2881
01:56:44.551 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 2>right to speak their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2882
01:56:46.531 --> 01:56:47.311
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

2883
01:56:47.311 --> 01:56:48.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a lot of people now all of a sudden</v>

2884
01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:52.000
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech just taken a back door</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my,</v>

2885
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:53.600
<v Speaker 2>my sensibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2886
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be offended because she</v>

2887
01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:57.900
<v Speaker 2>play out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cheap way out to just say I'm</v>

2888
01:56:57.901 --> 01:57:00.050
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people have to sort of act,</v>

2889
01:57:00.051 --> 01:57:02.280
<v Speaker 2>we ask and they have to figure out some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a way to,</v>

2890
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:03.680
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2891
01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.510
<v Speaker 2>calm down your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2892
01:57:05.511 --> 01:57:08.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>offended personality or your,</v>

2893
01:57:08.161 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 2>your whatever it is about what you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

2894
01:57:12.090 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2895
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.460
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said earlier,</v>

2896
01:57:14.461 --> 01:57:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a right not to be</v>

2897
01:57:16.051 --> 01:57:17.100
<v Speaker 2>offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2898
01:57:17.101 --> 01:57:19.160
<v Speaker 2>and there's gonna be a lot of defensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the world and,</v>

2899
01:57:19.161 --> 01:57:19.541
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2900
01:57:19.541 --> 01:57:21.960
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that you defend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2901
01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:24.810
<v Speaker 2>people that are being offensive is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're defending what they're</v>

2902
01:57:24.811 --> 01:57:26.760
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're defending your right to be</v>

2903
01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:28.830
<v Speaker 2>offensive to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because look,</v>

2904
01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:31.320
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the socialists.</v>

2905
01:57:31.321 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 2>There can be a lot of socialists that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are offended by the fact that I believe</v>

2906
01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:37.920
<v Speaker 2>in the free market or people can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>offended that I think people should have</v>

2907
01:57:37.921 --> 01:57:40.290
<v Speaker 2>a right to be able to discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2908
01:57:40.291 --> 01:57:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so now if,</v>

2909
01:57:42.551 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not going to protect somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else's right to free speech,</v>

2910
01:57:45.331 --> 01:57:48.150
<v Speaker 2>then they could take away mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't want the government</v>

2911
01:57:48.151 --> 01:57:49.410
<v Speaker 2>determining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2912
01:57:49.411 --> 01:57:50.730
<v Speaker 2>what's offensive and what's not.</v>

2913
01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the government saying this</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is protected in this speech,</v>

2914
01:57:53.731 --> 01:57:55.380
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the minute you go down that</v>

2915
01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:56.850
<v Speaker 2>slippery slope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2916
01:57:56.851 --> 01:57:57.870
<v Speaker 2>the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2917
01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 2>all the libertarians are now fascist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of us can speak.</v>

2918
01:58:00.631 --> 01:58:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2919
01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:02.880
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government gets more and more power</v>

2920
01:58:02.881 --> 01:58:04.860
<v Speaker 2>and they try to shut people up that want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to criticize it.</v>

2921
01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:09.890
<v Speaker 2>That's truly shrinking government and</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly letting the marketplace of ideas</v>

2922
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:13.950
<v Speaker 2>decide what people do and don't do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>which way they gravitate.</v>

2923
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:14.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I said,</v>

2924
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I think the free market and competition</v>
<v Speaker 2>will punish racist.</v>

2925
01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I think their businesses will fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're going to succeed</v>

2926
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:25.410
<v Speaker 2>as well as people who are broader</v>
<v Speaker 2>minded,</v>

2927
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.470
<v Speaker 2>who are looking beyond sex and looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond,</v>

2928
01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:29.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2929
01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 2>race and just hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2930
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.630
<v Speaker 2>based on ability and based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2931
01:58:33.631 --> 01:58:35.570
<v Speaker 2>all those other characteristics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2932
01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.740
<v Speaker 2>that are relevant to the job</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

2933
01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:41.190
<v Speaker 2>And to the extent that there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a disparity,</v>

2934
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 2>if there's going to be certain</v>

2935
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:46.420
<v Speaker 4>occupations that are mostly men at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain occupations that are women,</v>

2936
01:58:46.421 --> 01:58:49.870
<v Speaker 4>it's not because of discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in fact if you look at this nonsense</v>

2937
01:58:49.871 --> 01:58:50.704
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2938
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 4>women are paid like seventies whatever's</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense for every man,</v>

2939
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:57.130
<v Speaker 4>which obviously that's not true because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was true.</v>

2940
01:58:57.131 --> 01:59:00.070
<v Speaker 4>I would only hire women and pay him 77</v>
<v Speaker 4>cents on the dollar.</v>

2941
01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could actually hire women cheaper</v>

2942
01:59:02.501 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 4>than men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm out.</v>

2943
01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:05.310
<v Speaker 4>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I even know?</v>

2944
01:59:05.311 --> 01:59:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Why would I ever hire a man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would only hire women.</v>

2945
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I've had this conversation many times</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people that really believe that it</v>

2946
01:59:11.071 --> 01:59:14.260
<v Speaker 3>really believe in the gender pay gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no gender pay gap.</v>

2947
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:16.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that an amazing statistic that</v>

2948
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:17.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the president,</v>

2949
01:59:17.831 --> 01:59:22.780
<v Speaker 3>like when Obama was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that in a speech knowing</v>

2950
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:24.240
<v Speaker 3>it was disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2951
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:25.670
<v Speaker 3>no appeals</v>

2952
01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:28.160
<v Speaker 4>to women to get their votes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2953
01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:29.090
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2954
01:59:29.150 --> 01:59:33.560
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you basically a correct for all the</v>

2955
01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.060
<v Speaker 4>jobs classes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2956
01:59:35.061 --> 01:59:38.210
<v Speaker 4>So if you take a woman who's let's say</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 years old,</v>

2957
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:40.460
<v Speaker 4>never been married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2958
01:59:40.461 --> 01:59:41.840
<v Speaker 4>40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never married,</v>

2959
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:44.840
<v Speaker 4>basically the same educational</v>
<v Speaker 4>background and you study,</v>

2960
01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:47.150
<v Speaker 4>you'll find that they pretty much make</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same.</v>

2961
01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that when you look at the choices</v>

2962
01:59:50.181 --> 01:59:54.110
<v Speaker 4>that the typical woman makes during her</v>
<v Speaker 4>career and you know,</v>

2963
01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:57.650
<v Speaker 4>even if it's the same occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say they're both lawyers and they</v>

2964
01:59:57.651 --> 02:00:00.710
<v Speaker 4>both went to the same law school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if they both get married,</v>

2965
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:03.580
<v Speaker 4>the chances are the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2966
02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:07.760
<v Speaker 4>took a back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took her law career and it became</v>

2967
02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:10.370
<v Speaker 4>secondary to her children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

2968
02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.870
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she worked fewer hours.</v>

2969
02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:15.650
<v Speaker 4>She didn't travel as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got herself off that track and went</v>

2970
02:00:15.651 --> 02:00:17.850
<v Speaker 4>on more of a mommy track because not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2971
02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Do all women do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2972
02:00:18.861 --> 02:00:21.050
<v Speaker 4>But more women are likely and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2973
02:00:21.051 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 4>and they prefer that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2974
02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:24.920
<v Speaker 4>They prefer so they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't work as much.</v>

2975
02:00:24.921 --> 02:00:29.420
<v Speaker 4>They don't volunteer to travel as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's because of the choices that</v>

2976
02:00:29.421 --> 02:00:33.170
<v Speaker 4>they make along the way that they end up</v>
<v Speaker 4>earning less money than their male</v>

2977
02:00:33.171 --> 02:00:35.180
<v Speaker 4>counterpart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not because somebody has just</v>

2978
02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.300
<v Speaker 4>discriminating against them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there is a competitive market.</v>

2979
02:00:38.301 --> 02:00:40.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are a woman that is working just</v>

2980
02:00:40.761 --> 02:00:44.840
<v Speaker 4>as hard as a man and you're sacrificing</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything for your career and you know</v>

2981
02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:48.170
<v Speaker 4>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to earn the same as the guy</v>

2982
02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.000
<v Speaker 4>make us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a competitive market,</v>

2983
02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:52.250
<v Speaker 4>especially for those higher skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2984
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:55.970
<v Speaker 4>you just can't underpay people in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>marketplace because somebody else will</v>

2985
02:00:55.971 --> 02:00:58.670
<v Speaker 4>outbid you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's such a convenient talking</v>

2986
02:00:58.671 --> 02:00:59.690
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2987
02:00:59.691 --> 02:01:01.460
<v Speaker 4>It's the lie of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the left.</v>

2988
02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.650
<v Speaker 4>It's how you get votes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2989
02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting paid less because you're</v>

2990
02:01:04.731 --> 02:01:07.070
<v Speaker 4>being victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're being discriminated against.</v>

2991
02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.810
<v Speaker 4>So vote for me and I'll fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will force your employer to pay you</v>

2992
02:01:11.811 --> 02:01:12.411
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

2993
02:01:12.411 --> 02:01:13.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

2994
02:01:13.491 --> 02:01:15.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that Willie Sutton was one of</v>

2995
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:16.430
<v Speaker 4>his famous quotes was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2996
02:01:16.431 --> 02:01:17.900
<v Speaker 4>why do you rob banks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2997
02:01:17.901 --> 02:01:19.430
<v Speaker 4>because that's where the money is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2998
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:24.490
<v Speaker 4>So the votes are with employees much</v>
<v Speaker 4>more people have jobs then create jobs,</v>

2999
02:01:25.131 --> 02:01:27.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're trying to get the votes</v>

3000
02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:30.110
<v Speaker 4>votes of the employee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's better than getting votes of</v>

3001
02:01:30.111 --> 02:01:32.150
<v Speaker 4>employers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of people get votes by</v>

3002
02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:34.640
<v Speaker 4>promising to force their boss to give</v>
<v Speaker 4>them something.</v>

3003
02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:38.330
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get more vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get a more sick days,</v>

3004
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:41.300
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get and a half he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to have to do this.</v>

3005
02:01:41.301 --> 02:01:42.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that,</v>

3006
02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.810
<v Speaker 4>the employer doesn't give you anything.</v>

3007
02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 4>So if he's going to give you more</v>
<v Speaker 4>vacation is because he's going to pay</v>

3008
02:01:47.841 --> 02:01:48.920
<v Speaker 4>you less than wages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3009
02:01:48.921 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 4>it's all a trade off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3010
02:01:50.001 --> 02:01:52.100
<v Speaker 4>when the government mandates certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits,</v>

3011
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 4>all they're doing is taking your choice</v>
<v Speaker 4>away to negotiate how you want to be</v>

3012
02:01:55.521 --> 02:01:58.280
<v Speaker 4>compensated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because ultimately the employer is not</v>

3013
02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 4>going to pay you more than you're worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you say,</v>

3014
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:01.790
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to give this person,</v>

3015
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these vacations,</v>

3016
02:02:03.531 --> 02:02:04.311
<v Speaker 4>or you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3017
02:02:04.311 --> 02:02:06.770
<v Speaker 4>well I gotta pay him less money so I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>give them the vacations.</v>

3018
02:02:06.771 --> 02:02:08.510
<v Speaker 4>It's all one big compensation package.</v>

3019
02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it's a political thing.</v>

3020
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a thing that people do in order to</v>

3021
02:02:12.521 --> 02:02:16.690
<v Speaker 3>get you to lean towards them more and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you feel that,</v>

3022
02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:18.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have people feel that this person is</v>

3023
02:02:18.971 --> 02:02:21.700
<v Speaker 3>looking out for my needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This person is looking out from my point</v>

3024
02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:22.780
<v Speaker 3>of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my perspective,</v>

3025
02:02:22.781 --> 02:02:25.060
<v Speaker 3>and he understands the plight that women</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through.</v>

3026
02:02:25.061 --> 02:02:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Peter Schiff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so hardcore,</v>

3027
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:30.880
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is capitalistic that he doesn't even</v>

3028
02:02:30.881 --> 02:02:33.430
<v Speaker 3>care about what women go through or</v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination or,</v>

3029
02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.370
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the reality is if I didn't</v>

3030
02:02:35.371 --> 02:02:37.860
<v Speaker 4>care about women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't care about these laws.</v>

3031
02:02:37.861 --> 02:02:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I understand how these laws backfire and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurt women.</v>

3032
02:02:40.710 --> 02:02:41.890
<v Speaker 4>I understand how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3033
02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:44.730
<v Speaker 4>all these laws that are meant to do good</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually do harm.</v>

3034
02:02:44.850 --> 02:02:47.940
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find a lot of liberals,</v>

3035
02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:51.480
<v Speaker 4>they actually think conservatives or</v>
<v Speaker 4>libertarians are bad people,</v>

3036
02:02:51.570 --> 02:02:52.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they said,</v>

3037
02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:54.240
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're against this law.</v>

3038
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:57.210
<v Speaker 4>You must be a bad person because this</v>
<v Speaker 4>law is going to help people in their</v>

3039
02:02:57.211 --> 02:02:59.760
<v Speaker 4>mind you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because otherwise I would support the</v>

3040
02:02:59.761 --> 02:03:00.594
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3041
02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:03.030
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I think about most liberals,</v>

3042
02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:05.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think they're misunderstood.</v>

3043
02:03:05.521 --> 02:03:06.540
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're misinformed.</v>

3044
02:03:06.541 --> 02:03:07.710
<v Speaker 4>They're ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand.</v>

3045
02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:09.420
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're good people,</v>

3046
02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:12.630
<v Speaker 4>but they're going about it in a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand that the road to</v>

3047
02:03:12.631 --> 02:03:14.250
<v Speaker 4>hell is paved with good intentions.</v>

3048
02:03:14.430 --> 02:03:16.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care how many good intentions</v>

3049
02:03:16.801 --> 02:03:18.870
<v Speaker 4>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I know that that road is going to</v>

3050
02:03:18.871 --> 02:03:20.670
<v Speaker 4>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try my best,</v>

3051
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:21.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3052
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:22.950
<v Speaker 4>to build a different road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3053
02:03:22.951 --> 02:03:26.490
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that free market capitalism is</v>

3054
02:03:26.491 --> 02:03:28.890
<v Speaker 4>the best way to raise the standard of</v>
<v Speaker 4>living of everybody.</v>

3055
02:03:28.891 --> 02:03:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Whether you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're black,</v>

3056
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:34.530
<v Speaker 4>whether you're homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the individual acting freely.</v>

3057
02:03:34.531 --> 02:03:37.830
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be your best hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to empower government,</v>

3058
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:39.660
<v Speaker 4>and this is one of the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't never,</v>

3059
02:03:39.661 --> 02:03:41.520
<v Speaker 4>I can never figure out because people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

3060
02:03:41.521 --> 02:03:43.050
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very suspicious of,</v>

3061
02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.780
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of businesses and businessmen,</v>

3062
02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:48.390
<v Speaker 4>yet they can have complete trust in</v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians.</v>

3063
02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:52.830
<v Speaker 4>You get politicians all this power and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you trust them to use it.</v>

3064
02:03:52.831 --> 02:03:53.820
<v Speaker 4>But evidently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3065
02:03:53.821 --> 02:03:57.810
<v Speaker 4>why aren't they just as corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just because somebody uses politics to</v>

3066
02:03:57.811 --> 02:04:00.510
<v Speaker 4>get rich doesn't mean they're on some</v>
<v Speaker 4>moral high ground.</v>

3067
02:04:00.630 --> 02:04:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even worse.</v>

3068
02:04:01.530 --> 02:04:05.190
<v Speaker 3>This idea that if you give it more of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your taxes that the government is</v>

3069
02:04:05.191 --> 02:04:08.310
<v Speaker 3>somehow another going to going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>competent with how they distribute those</v>

3070
02:04:08.311 --> 02:04:11.730
<v Speaker 3>taxes and that there's some going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian.</v>

3071
02:04:11.731 --> 02:04:14.580
<v Speaker 3>The they're gonna use the taxes for good</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3072
02:04:14.581 --> 02:04:18.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a very disgusting sort of an idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that any sense at all</v>

3073
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:22.270
<v Speaker 4>or the idea that government is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make better decisions for you or your</v>

3074
02:04:22.271 --> 02:04:23.530
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you are right.</v>

3075
02:04:23.531 --> 02:04:25.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean the government doesn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3076
02:04:25.031 --> 02:04:27.040
<v Speaker 4>They don't know your kids yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to,</v>

3077
02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:29.500
<v Speaker 4>they're going to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what they eat or where they go</v>

3078
02:04:29.501 --> 02:04:33.310
<v Speaker 4>to school or you know know that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that care about your kids or you,</v>

3079
02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.630
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you care.</v>

3080
02:04:34.631 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at these lousy schools that</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately why so many people vote</v>

3081
02:04:38.281 --> 02:04:41.580
<v Speaker 4>for Bernie Sanders is because they went</v>
<v Speaker 4>to these government schools and they got</v>

3082
02:04:41.581 --> 02:04:44.220
<v Speaker 4>a lousy education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their teachers a socialist.</v>

3083
02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:46.260
<v Speaker 4>It's all the whole socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the system.</v>

3084
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:50.160
<v Speaker 4>But the parents are trapped because</v>
<v Speaker 4>their taxes are already paying for these</v>

3085
02:04:50.161 --> 02:04:52.020
<v Speaker 4>lousy schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're monopolies,</v>

3086
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.550
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3087
02:04:53.551 --> 02:04:56.310
<v Speaker 4>but if the Liberals Act as if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3088
02:04:56.311 --> 02:04:59.280
<v Speaker 4>if we didn't have government schools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then parents wouldn't educate their</v>

3089
02:04:59.281 --> 02:05:00.240
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course they would.</v>

3090
02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't think they would send their</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids to private schools and they'd be a</v>

3091
02:05:02.821 --> 02:05:04.770
<v Speaker 4>lot less expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'd have all kinds of</v>

3092
02:05:04.771 --> 02:05:06.600
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneurs who are trying to earn</v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

3093
02:05:06.601 --> 02:05:10.020
<v Speaker 4>educating poor kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like people earn a lot of money,</v>

3094
02:05:10.021 --> 02:05:12.270
<v Speaker 4>clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor kids and feeding poor kids and,</v>

3095
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:14.690
<v Speaker 4>and housing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if there's money to be made and</v>

3096
02:05:14.691 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneur is going to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfy that desire,</v>

3097
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:20.740
<v Speaker 4>but you against public education or do</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just think that,</v>

3098
02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.950
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be subsidized the way it</v>

3099
02:05:22.951 --> 02:05:24.510
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like especially colleges.</v>

3100
02:05:24.570 --> 02:05:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that government education is</v>

3101
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:31.200
<v Speaker 4>much too expensive and not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3102
02:05:31.201 --> 02:05:32.070
<v Speaker 4>people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3103
02:05:32.071 --> 02:05:35.130
<v Speaker 4>we need the government to educate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

3104
02:05:35.131 --> 02:05:36.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>education is very important and I,</v>

3105
02:05:36.881 --> 02:05:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just shouldn't leave it up to</v>

3106
02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:40.930
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the free market,</v>

3107
02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:44.400
<v Speaker 4>the free market does a better job of</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating computers,</v>

3108
02:05:44.490 --> 02:05:44.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3109
02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:48.480
<v Speaker 4>I think it will do a better job of</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating education and people are</v>

3110
02:05:48.481 --> 02:05:50.790
<v Speaker 4>struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really liked the idea that at least</v>

3111
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:53.700
<v Speaker 4>education is free for the children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not free.</v>

3112
02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Every nothing that the government</v>
<v Speaker 4>provides is free.</v>

3113
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.560
<v Speaker 4>It costs money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3114
02:05:57.570 --> 02:06:01.280
<v Speaker 4>Where's that money coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government has to take money and the</v>

3115
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:04.020
<v Speaker 4>stuff that you get for free from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government is very expensive.</v>

3116
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:07.710
<v Speaker 4>The stuff that you get from the free</v>
<v Speaker 4>market that you pay for is much less</v>

3117
02:06:07.711 --> 02:06:09.420
<v Speaker 4>expensive and it's a much higher</v>
<v Speaker 4>quality.</v>

3118
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the problem with colleges,</v>

3119
02:06:11.611 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a lot of colleges that are not</v>

3120
02:06:13.081 --> 02:06:16.170
<v Speaker 4>run necessarily by government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why are they so expensive?</v>

3121
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Because the government subsidizes</v>
<v Speaker 4>university tuition by either</v>

3122
02:06:20.611 --> 02:06:24.000
<v Speaker 4>guaranteeing loans or directly providing</v>
<v Speaker 4>loans to students,</v>

3123
02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:27.780
<v Speaker 4>and this drives up the price of college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that college is so expensive</v>

3124
02:06:27.930 --> 02:06:30.450
<v Speaker 4>is because of government subsidizing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cost.</v>

3125
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:33.540
<v Speaker 4>So there is no free market to control</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cost.</v>

3126
02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:37.590
<v Speaker 4>You just have the government to</v>
<v Speaker 4>subsidize the ever escalating costs and</v>

3127
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:39.050
<v Speaker 4>providing all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you know,</v>

3128
02:06:39.090 --> 02:06:42.810
<v Speaker 4>people go to college and they graduate</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a mortgage without a house.</v>

3129
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:44.790
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the government that's did that.</v>

3130
02:06:44.791 --> 02:06:48.060
<v Speaker 4>But you have these liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think the government is helping</v>

3131
02:06:48.061 --> 02:06:48.570
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

3132
02:06:48.570 --> 02:06:49.381
<v Speaker 4>the liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll say,</v>

3133
02:06:49.381 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 4>vote for me and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll make sure you get a loan so you can</v>

3134
02:06:51.841 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 4>go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3135
02:06:52.861 --> 02:06:56.070
<v Speaker 4>the only reason they need a loan is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the college is so expensive.</v>

3136
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:58.620
<v Speaker 4>And why is it college so expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because of the loans.</v>

3137
02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:03.090
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My father went to college and his</v>

3138
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:05.640
<v Speaker 4>parents didn't have any money because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were poor and middle,</v>

3139
02:07:05.641 --> 02:07:07.230
<v Speaker 4>lower middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3140
02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:11.130
<v Speaker 4>but so he worked his way through college</v>
<v Speaker 4>by having a summer job.</v>

3141
02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:13.470
<v Speaker 4>And that summer job was enough to pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>for everything.</v>

3142
02:07:13.471 --> 02:07:14.251
<v Speaker 4>Room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>board,</v>

3143
02:07:14.251 --> 02:07:16.380
<v Speaker 4>tuition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of his friends work their way</v>

3144
02:07:16.381 --> 02:07:19.170
<v Speaker 4>through college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't Americans work their way</v>

3145
02:07:19.171 --> 02:07:21.210
<v Speaker 4>through college today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the government made college so</v>

3146
02:07:21.211 --> 02:07:24.210
<v Speaker 4>expensive because of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the loans.</v>

3147
02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 4>But what happened is the government</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

3148
02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to have a job while</v>

3149
02:07:27.691 --> 02:07:28.650
<v Speaker 4>you're in college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll just,</v>

3150
02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:30.600
<v Speaker 4>we'll just guarantee alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3151
02:07:30.601 --> 02:07:32.010
<v Speaker 4>and you'll just be able to borrow the</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

3152
02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:34.680
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>graduated with a bunch of debt,</v>

3153
02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:37.540
<v Speaker 4>doesn't do the kids any favors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would've been better off,</v>

3154
02:07:37.570 --> 02:07:38.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3155
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.690
<v Speaker 4>pain having a summer job instead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3156
02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just partying all summer or taking</v>

3157
02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:45.760
<v Speaker 4>spamming their summers around Europe</v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're borrowing money.</v>

3158
02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's two giant issues with that one.</v>

3159
02:07:47.681 --> 02:07:51.310
<v Speaker 3>One giant issue with the debt is you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out of college and you're going</v>

3160
02:07:51.311 --> 02:07:53.650
<v Speaker 3>to take a job that's probably not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay you a whole lot in the first</v>

3161
02:07:53.651 --> 02:07:57.970
<v Speaker 3>place and you're saddled down with who</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows how many thousands,</v>

3162
02:07:57.971 --> 02:08:00.160
<v Speaker 3>maybe even hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars worth of debt.</v>

3163
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:04.150
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even go bankrupt and dissolve</v>

3164
02:08:04.151 --> 02:08:05.410
<v Speaker 3>that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the well,</v>

3165
02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.600
<v Speaker 3>his country that you're stuck with</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

3166
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Terrible kids take on this debt when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're 17 1819 making good decisions.</v>

3167
02:08:13.101 --> 02:08:15.150
<v Speaker 4>So they're terrible decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're horrible decision.</v>

3168
02:08:15.151 --> 02:08:15.860
<v Speaker 4>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3169
02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:17.020
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't understand.</v>

3170
02:08:17.021 --> 02:08:18.970
<v Speaker 4>They don't know anything about money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are two consequences.</v>

3171
02:08:18.971 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they've been fed a lie that will,</v>

3172
02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:21.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't go to college,</v>

3173
02:08:21.881 --> 02:08:23.200
<v Speaker 4>your life is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll never,</v>

3174
02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:24.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew I,</v>

3175
02:08:24.161 --> 02:08:26.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do some of my videos on my channel,</v>

3176
02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:28.630
<v Speaker 4>my youtube channel and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the videos that I did and I</v>

3177
02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:30.820
<v Speaker 4>wish it got more views and maybe it will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

3178
02:08:30.821 --> 02:08:33.100
<v Speaker 4>I could talk about on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does the Youtube Channel Tell</v>

3179
02:08:33.101 --> 02:08:34.210
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peter Schiff.</v>

3180
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.440
<v Speaker 4>Peter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3181
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:37.210
<v Speaker 4>My name is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the shift report,</v>

3182
02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:40.910
<v Speaker 4>but one of the videos I did and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>called,</v>

3183
02:08:40.911 --> 02:08:43.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a college degree worth the cost you</v>

3184
02:08:43.301 --> 02:08:46.810
<v Speaker 4>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I did this like four years ago down</v>

3185
02:08:46.811 --> 02:08:47.644
<v Speaker 4>in New Orleans.</v>

3186
02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:50.350
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went down the street and I was asking</v>

3187
02:08:50.351 --> 02:08:53.350
<v Speaker 4>people who were working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't talk to people who are just</v>

3188
02:08:53.351 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 4>there to have drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked at the people who were working</v>

3189
02:08:55.481 --> 02:08:56.560
<v Speaker 4>on Bourbon Street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3190
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:59.440
<v Speaker 4>They were strippers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were bouncers,</v>

3191
02:08:59.590 --> 02:09:02.110
<v Speaker 4>they were petty cab drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were bartenders.</v>

3192
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.960
<v Speaker 4>They were taken out the trash cans and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't discriminate.</v>

3193
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 4>I asked everybody I saw and almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody I talked to is on this video.</v>

3194
02:09:09.191 --> 02:09:10.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few people didn't make it.</v>

3195
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:13.930
<v Speaker 4>And I basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you go to college?</v>

3196
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.460
<v Speaker 4>When did you graduate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3197
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was your major and how much do you</v>

3198
02:09:18.071 --> 02:09:19.000
<v Speaker 4>owe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3199
02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:23.230
<v Speaker 4>And every single person that I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was doing a menial job,</v>

3200
02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:25.690
<v Speaker 4>and some of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them had two or three degrees,</v>

3201
02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:29.490
<v Speaker 4>master's degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is all and,</v>

3202
02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:30.790
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the point was,</v>

3203
02:09:30.791 --> 02:09:33.400
<v Speaker 4>and some people thought I was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make fun of the people and I wasn't</v>

3204
02:09:33.401 --> 02:09:34.300
<v Speaker 4>trying to make fun of anybody.</v>

3205
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:37.960
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to prove a point that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a complete waste of time and money.</v>

3206
02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.650
<v Speaker 4>That these individuals could have done</v>
<v Speaker 4>these jobs without college.</v>

3207
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:44.200
<v Speaker 4>They could have done it right out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>high school without all this debt.</v>

3208
02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:47.710
<v Speaker 4>And that just having these degrees</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't mean anything.</v>

3209
02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:51.400
<v Speaker 4>Who benefited from these degrees?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The universities that sold these</v>

3210
02:09:51.401 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 4>overpriced degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they benefited the,</v>

3211
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's who benefits from all these</v>

3212
02:09:55.991 --> 02:09:59.280
<v Speaker 4>college loans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not these kids who borrow $50,000 and</v>

3213
02:09:59.281 --> 02:10:02.770
<v Speaker 4>now hour emptying trash cans because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got some liberal arts degree that's</v>

3214
02:10:02.771 --> 02:10:04.700
<v Speaker 4>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the universities,</v>

3215
02:10:04.710 --> 02:10:09.190
<v Speaker 4>the college that got the over got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>overcharge for degree that the kid would</v>

3216
02:10:09.191 --> 02:10:11.770
<v Speaker 4>have been better off without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's also the opportunity</v>

3217
02:10:11.771 --> 02:10:12.700
<v Speaker 4>cost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3218
02:10:12.730 --> 02:10:15.670
<v Speaker 4>you spend five or six years now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>these overcrowded colleges,</v>

3219
02:10:15.671 --> 02:10:16.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be four years,</v>

3220
02:10:16.751 --> 02:10:19.990
<v Speaker 4>but now it's so hard to get the classes</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sometimes it takes you five or six</v>

3221
02:10:19.991 --> 02:10:22.480
<v Speaker 4>years to even graduate and you graduate</v>
<v Speaker 4>with nothing.</v>

3222
02:10:22.930 --> 02:10:25.360
<v Speaker 4>You've got a worthless degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got politicians that are saying</v>

3223
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:26.890
<v Speaker 4>everybody needs to have a college</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>

3224
02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:28.450
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well if everybody has one,</v>

3225
02:10:28.451 --> 02:10:29.650
<v Speaker 4>what's it worth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

3226
02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:31.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one point,</v>

3227
02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:33.440
<v Speaker 4>maybe one in 10 people had a college</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree because,</v>

3228
02:10:33.441 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 4>and then it actually meant something</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you had something that not</v>

3229
02:10:36.021 --> 02:10:37.970
<v Speaker 4>everybody else has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3230
02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 4>if everybody has a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've actually destroyed the value</v>

3231
02:10:41.241 --> 02:10:42.920
<v Speaker 4>of the degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what the government has done.</v>

3232
02:10:42.921 --> 02:10:45.320
<v Speaker 4>They've made a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely expensive to get,</v>

3233
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:48.620
<v Speaker 4>but there's very little value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have all these politicians are</v>

3234
02:10:48.650 --> 02:10:50.450
<v Speaker 4>not qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe colleges,</v>

3235
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:53.360
<v Speaker 4>they'll try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at how much more money people make</v>

3236
02:10:53.361 --> 02:10:56.510
<v Speaker 4>who have college degrees versus people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who don't have college degrees.</v>

3237
02:10:56.690 --> 02:10:59.180
<v Speaker 4>And they assume that the reason for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the college degree.</v>

3238
02:10:59.450 --> 02:11:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's false statistics,</v>

3239
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:04.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because think about the typical person</v>

3240
02:11:04.341 --> 02:11:05.630
<v Speaker 4>who chooses to go to college.</v>

3241
02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:07.640
<v Speaker 4>They're smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're more ambitious,</v>

3242
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:10.640
<v Speaker 4>they're harder working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're making more money,</v>

3243
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:12.920
<v Speaker 4>not because they have a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3244
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:17.360
<v Speaker 4>So if you probably looked at two</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals from the same circumstances,</v>

3245
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:20.510
<v Speaker 4>maybe same high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same demographic,</v>

3246
02:11:20.511 --> 02:11:23.030
<v Speaker 4>they got the same GPA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got the same,</v>

3247
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.901
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3248
02:11:23.901 --> 02:11:24.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3249
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:25.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sat scores.</v>

3250
02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.760
<v Speaker 4>One went to college and one didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you followed them.</v>

3251
02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:33.230
<v Speaker 4>You might find that the guy that had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>gumption to skip college is actually</v>

3252
02:11:33.231 --> 02:11:35.480
<v Speaker 4>making more money than the guy who went</v>
<v Speaker 4>to college.</v>

3253
02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he started a business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he,</v>

3254
02:11:37.190 --> 02:11:40.970
<v Speaker 4>he gained some real world experience and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he wasn't encumbered by a bunch of</v>

3255
02:11:40.971 --> 02:11:41.751
<v Speaker 4>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3256
02:11:41.751 --> 02:11:43.670
<v Speaker 4>So it's not the college degree at this</v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

3257
02:11:43.671 --> 02:11:44.120
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet.</v>

3258
02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:47.210
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure you got to go to college or you got</v>

3259
02:11:47.211 --> 02:11:51.440
<v Speaker 4>to go to med school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are a lot of things that you</v>

3260
02:11:51.441 --> 02:11:54.620
<v Speaker 4>don't need a college degree to do and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people who were doing them have</v>

3261
02:11:54.621 --> 02:11:58.520
<v Speaker 4>college degrees and their success is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>a function of that college degree.</v>

3262
02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a function of the hard work that</v>

3263
02:12:00.441 --> 02:12:02.300
<v Speaker 4>they did after they left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>College.</v>

3264
02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Education is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can get a tremendous amount of</v>

3265
02:12:05.991 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 4>education today and this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3266
02:12:08.151 --> 02:12:11.240
<v Speaker 4>the 18 hundreds you can get it online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh you can get it through books.</v>

3267
02:12:11.241 --> 02:12:13.190
<v Speaker 4>You can get it through audio course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not,</v>

3268
02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:17.210
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I'm not anti-education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people should educate themselves</v>

3269
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:19.510
<v Speaker 4>and you're anti the college debt people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

3270
02:12:19.670 --> 02:12:21.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm anti the government saying the only</v>

3271
02:12:21.711 --> 02:12:23.750
<v Speaker 4>way to get educated is to have a school</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

3272
02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:25.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know there are a lot of Americans we</v>

3273
02:12:25.671 --> 02:12:27.110
<v Speaker 4>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know Robert E.</v>

3274
02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'd go to the founding fathers.</v>

3275
02:12:28.371 --> 02:12:31.070
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these guys were all self</v>
<v Speaker 4>educated men.</v>

3276
02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:33.020
<v Speaker 4>They didn't necessarily go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them did,</v>

3277
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.640
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them were self educated.</v>

3278
02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:38.180
<v Speaker 4>And believe me back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>educating yourself was pretty hard.</v>

3279
02:12:38.181 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean the only books you had were the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones that you could check out of a</v>

3280
02:12:40.701 --> 02:12:41.900
<v Speaker 4>library.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3281
02:12:41.901 --> 02:12:45.320
<v Speaker 4>now anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any kid in a poor inner city has</v>

3282
02:12:45.321 --> 02:12:48.440
<v Speaker 4>everything at his fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could go on the Internet and you can</v>

3283
02:12:48.441 --> 02:12:52.790
<v Speaker 4>teach yourself and in fact professors</v>
<v Speaker 4>can sell courses online.</v>

3284
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:54.470
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3285
02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:56.040
<v Speaker 4>go to a college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

3286
02:12:56.250 --> 02:12:58.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some professor can have a tutorial site</v>

3287
02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:00.110
<v Speaker 4>and he could charge like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3288
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:02.740
<v Speaker 4>10 bucks a month and he could give</v>
<v Speaker 4>lectures and he can teach,</v>

3289
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:06.830
<v Speaker 4>you can learn all sorts of stuff without</v>
<v Speaker 4>enriching some government bureaucracy,</v>

3290
02:13:06.831 --> 02:13:11.831
<v Speaker 4>some college or university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have to borrow tens of</v>

3291
02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:14.270
<v Speaker 4>thousands or hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars to learn what you can learn for</v>

3292
02:13:14.271 --> 02:13:16.940
<v Speaker 4>practically nothing on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3293
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Speaking to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know we spent a lot of time here,</v>

3294
02:13:19.551 --> 02:13:22.820
<v Speaker 4>but I can't let you leave unless I ask</v>
<v Speaker 4>you this one last thing.</v>

3295
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.460
<v Speaker 4>What are your thoughts on</v>
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies,</v>

3296
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:27.590
<v Speaker 4>specifically bitcoin and all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

3297
02:13:27.591 --> 02:13:28.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know,</v>

3298
02:13:28.491 --> 02:13:30.010
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about that and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3299
02:13:30.090 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 4>hopefully we have enough time to really</v>
<v Speaker 4>hash this,</v>

3300
02:13:32.191 --> 02:13:33.011
<v Speaker 4>this subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

3301
02:13:33.011 --> 02:13:33.601
<v Speaker 4>cause I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3302
02:13:33.601 --> 02:13:38.040
<v Speaker 4>I was on your show a few years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about cryptocurrencies and you</v>

3303
02:13:38.041 --> 02:13:40.110
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was very skeptical about them then and</v>

3304
02:13:40.111 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm as skeptical about them now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course,</v>

3305
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:46.500
<v Speaker 4>obviously had you just bought them when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was here a few years ago.</v>

3306
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Skyrocket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3307
02:13:47.530 --> 02:13:49.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously if you bought them back then</v>

3308
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:53.700
<v Speaker 4>you could turn around and you can sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>them today for a lot more money,</v>

3309
02:13:53.730 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3310
02:13:54.330 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 4>but does that mean they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>work?</v>

3311
02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean they're going to fulfill</v>
<v Speaker 4>the promise that everybody believes?</v>

3312
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is it that people believe about</v>

3313
02:14:03.541 --> 02:14:06.120
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe that it's going to be</v>

3314
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:06.810
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3315
02:14:06.810 --> 02:14:11.810
<v Speaker 4>That is going to either replace or exist</v>
<v Speaker 4>alongside of the dollar,</v>

3316
02:14:13.050 --> 02:14:14.730
<v Speaker 4>the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the yen,</v>

3317
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:15.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it's,</v>

3318
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Speaker 4>people are going to use it as a medium</v>
<v Speaker 4>of exchange that is going to be a store</v>

3319
02:14:18.421 --> 02:14:20.930
<v Speaker 4>of value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>

3320
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:23.250
<v Speaker 4>it's just not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is not going to happen.</v>

3321
02:14:23.251 --> 02:14:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I know there are a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe this and they almost believe it,</v>

3322
02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:26.820
<v Speaker 4>like a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3323
02:14:26.821 --> 02:14:29.910
<v Speaker 4>They believe it like a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that I don't believe it,</v>

3324
02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:30.811
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3325
02:14:30.811 --> 02:14:31.181
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3326
02:14:31.181 --> 02:14:32.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm either a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3327
02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm stuck in my ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't get it,</v>

3328
02:14:34.951 --> 02:14:35.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3329
02:14:35.791 --> 02:14:36.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3330
02:14:36.131 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it all before when it came to</v>

3331
02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:42.690
<v Speaker 4>the dotcoms when it came to the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>estate and it's not that,</v>

3332
02:14:42.691 --> 02:14:47.190
<v Speaker 4>like I did a podcast again on my own and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to compare,</v>

3333
02:14:47.770 --> 02:14:48.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

3334
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:49.410
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3335
02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet stocks and I was talking,</v>

3336
02:14:51.391 --> 02:14:53.460
<v Speaker 4>I use pets.com as an example.</v>

3337
02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:53.870
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3338
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:57.600
<v Speaker 4>looked at bitcoin and then somebody did</v>
<v Speaker 4>a video critical of me trying to explain</v>

3339
02:14:57.601 --> 02:15:00.240
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why bitcoin is not like pets.com.</v>

3340
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:05.460
<v Speaker 4>And I never tried to equate the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I was talking about was the idea</v>

3341
02:15:05.461 --> 02:15:09.000
<v Speaker 4>when pets.com was started and people</v>
<v Speaker 4>were making money because the stock went</v>

3342
02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:09.834
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3343
02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:13.620
<v Speaker 4>They thought that the business would</v>
<v Speaker 4>succeed as a business,</v>

3344
02:15:13.621 --> 02:15:16.110
<v Speaker 4>that it would make a profit right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it never did.</v>

3345
02:15:16.111 --> 02:15:20.700
<v Speaker 4>It went bankrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people bought it early on and it</v>

3346
02:15:20.701 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 4>went up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the fact that it went up didn't mean</v>

3347
02:15:23.401 --> 02:15:25.560
<v Speaker 4>that they were right in their ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 4>bet.</v>

3348
02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:28.860
<v Speaker 4>It just meant that other people made the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same mistake and paid an even higher</v>

3349
02:15:28.861 --> 02:15:31.350
<v Speaker 4>price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you can be wrong,</v>

3350
02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:35.670
<v Speaker 4>but still profit from being wrong as</v>
<v Speaker 4>long as there are other fools who are</v>

3351
02:15:35.671 --> 02:15:38.540
<v Speaker 4>also wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I see the similarity in</v>

3352
02:15:38.541 --> 02:15:40.050
<v Speaker 4>the cryptocurrencies or bitcoin.</v>

3353
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:43.470
<v Speaker 4>If somebody bought bitcoin a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two years ago,</v>

3354
02:15:43.471 --> 02:15:45.300
<v Speaker 4>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's now a lot higher,</v>

3355
02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.220
<v Speaker 4>it's only hire because other people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>more foolish than they were and other</v>

3356
02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 4>more people now believe something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to happen.</v>

3357
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think it's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen?</v>

3358
02:15:54.671 --> 02:15:56.250
<v Speaker 4>And what do you think are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>restrictions?</v>

3359
02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's holding it back.</v>

3360
02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:01.920
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people have to understand what money</v>

3361
02:16:01.921 --> 02:16:04.260
<v Speaker 4>is and what can succeed as money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3362
02:16:04.261 --> 02:16:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars and euros and yen intrinsically,</v>

3363
02:16:09.181 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 4>there's no value there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a piece of paper and they're</v>

3364
02:16:11.431 --> 02:16:14.010
<v Speaker 4>created out of thin air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they didn't,</v>

3365
02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.780
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3366
02:16:15.810 --> 02:16:18.930
<v Speaker 4>the dollar used to be backed by gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what gave the dollar value was the</v>

3367
02:16:18.931 --> 02:16:20.670
<v Speaker 4>gold backing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it had value,</v>

3368
02:16:20.671 --> 02:16:23.470
<v Speaker 4>because you can go and get gold for it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can convert it to gold,</v>

3369
02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 4>but gold.</v>

3370
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that gold became money and a</v>

3371
02:16:29.741 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 4>lot of things have been money and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>

3372
02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:33.900
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3373
02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:35.080
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's been money,</v>

3374
02:16:35.081 --> 02:16:37.300
<v Speaker 4>the most successful has been precious</v>
<v Speaker 4>metals.</v>

3375
02:16:37.301 --> 02:16:39.550
<v Speaker 4>People have used precious metals and</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold is just spend,</v>

3376
02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:40.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3377
02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.120
<v Speaker 4>the most precious of the metals that has</v>
<v Speaker 4>served as money.</v>

3378
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 4>But the reason that gold became money</v>
<v Speaker 4>and because before we had money,</v>

3379
02:16:47.470 --> 02:16:48.760
<v Speaker 4>it was all barter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3380
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.820
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3381
02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:54.400
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you made a chairs and you wanted a,</v>

3382
02:16:54.401 --> 02:16:55.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chicken,</v>

3383
02:16:55.331 --> 02:16:57.940
<v Speaker 4>you had to find a guy that grew chickens</v>
<v Speaker 4>who wanted one of your chairs,</v>

3384
02:16:57.941 --> 02:16:58.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had,</v>

3385
02:16:58.390 --> 02:17:01.090
<v Speaker 4>it was very inefficient barter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3386
02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:04.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody wanted gold,</v>

3387
02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 4>or at least wealthy people wanted gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a scarce item that everybody</v>

3388
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:11.950
<v Speaker 4>desired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the beauty of gold was that it's all</v>

3389
02:17:11.951 --> 02:17:13.690
<v Speaker 4>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can melt it down.</v>

3390
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:16.610
<v Speaker 4>You announced the gold is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3391
02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:18.730
<v Speaker 4>is the same as any other ounce of gold.</v>

3392
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:21.280
<v Speaker 4>And people realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

3393
02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:24.910
<v Speaker 4>instead of me looking for a chicken guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wants my chair,</v>

3394
02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I'll just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3395
02:17:27.490 --> 02:17:30.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give somebody gold.</v>

3396
02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:32.740
<v Speaker 4>They don't need my chair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can buy whatever they want with a</v>

3397
02:17:32.741 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 4>gold because gold is a commodity to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has value.</v>

3398
02:17:36.310 --> 02:17:38.500
<v Speaker 4>But unlike a chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's uniform.</v>

3399
02:17:38.501 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 4>You can put it in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3400
02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.220
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all the same and you can</v>

3401
02:17:42.221 --> 02:17:45.130
<v Speaker 4>divide up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So gold had these properties that made</v>

3402
02:17:45.131 --> 02:17:47.740
<v Speaker 4>it money and it was a store value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3403
02:17:47.741 --> 02:17:50.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over time there was pricing.</v>

3404
02:17:50.111 --> 02:17:54.430
<v Speaker 4>People could relate how much is a barrel</v>
<v Speaker 4>of oil terms of gold,</v>

3405
02:17:54.431 --> 02:17:58.810
<v Speaker 4>how much is a Bushel of wheat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can relate one commodity to another</v>

3406
02:17:58.811 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 4>and understand pricing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3407
02:18:01.331 --> 02:18:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3408
02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:02.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3409
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:04.470
<v Speaker 4>in Roman times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3410
02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:07.030
<v Speaker 4>you could buy a Toga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a nice toga for an ounce of gold,</v>

3411
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:07.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3412
02:18:07.330 --> 02:18:10.450
<v Speaker 4>So a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man could buy what was clothing back</v>

3413
02:18:10.451 --> 02:18:13.090
<v Speaker 4>then for an ounce of gold when you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy a suit of clothes today,</v>

3414
02:18:13.091 --> 02:18:14.560
<v Speaker 4>a nice suit of clothes for an ounce of</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold.</v>

3415
02:18:14.561 --> 02:18:15.161
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3416
02:18:15.161 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 4>prices have kind of remained relatively</v>
<v Speaker 4>constant and certain things.</v>

3417
02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:22.330
<v Speaker 4>So now years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess some Libertarians and some other</v>

3418
02:18:22.331 --> 02:18:23.680
<v Speaker 4>people got the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3419
02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:25.990
<v Speaker 4>crypt Fiat currencies are no good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is true.</v>

3420
02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:28.900
<v Speaker 4>They're not backed by anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>governance,</v>

3421
02:18:28.901 --> 02:18:30.880
<v Speaker 4>keep printing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got quantitative easing,</v>

3422
02:18:30.881 --> 02:18:34.960
<v Speaker 4>0% of the trades gold though they said</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold is inefficient,</v>

3423
02:18:34.961 --> 02:18:36.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I got announced the gold,</v>

3424
02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:38.290
<v Speaker 4>I really can't use it in commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3425
02:18:38.291 --> 02:18:41.620
<v Speaker 4>I can't scrape off a little piece of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and buy a cup of coffee.</v>

3426
02:18:41.621 --> 02:18:44.350
<v Speaker 4>I can't send it across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3427
02:18:44.351 --> 02:18:44.980
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3428
02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:47.350
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and conduct an ecommerce.</v>

3429
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:49.960
<v Speaker 4>So they came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone came up with a,</v>

3430
02:18:49.961 --> 02:18:51.230
<v Speaker 4>a digital currency initiative.</v>

3431
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:55.510
<v Speaker 4>The first one probably being bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was supposedly replicating all the</v>

3432
02:18:55.511 --> 02:18:58.990
<v Speaker 4>properties of gold only digitally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>making it better,</v>

3433
02:18:58.991 --> 02:18:59.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

3434
02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:00.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're mine,</v>

3435
02:19:00.821 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 4>these bitcoins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3436
02:19:01.721 --> 02:19:04.450
<v Speaker 4>Even though there's no actual mining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're solving these math problems,</v>

3437
02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:07.300
<v Speaker 4>but you could have a bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can give it to you,</v>

3438
02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:10.630
<v Speaker 4>you can give it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can break it in half intense,</v>

3439
02:19:10.690 --> 02:19:12.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's divisible.</v>

3440
02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:12.581
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3441
02:19:12.581 --> 02:19:13.750
<v Speaker 4>it's portable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3442
02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:15.040
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't decay,</v>

3443
02:19:15.041 --> 02:19:16.270
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't go away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3444
02:19:16.450 --> 02:19:17.051
<v Speaker 4>And so they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3445
02:19:17.051 --> 02:19:20.410
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can create a digital alternative to</v>

3446
02:19:20.411 --> 02:19:23.440
<v Speaker 4>gold and use that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will just use this and people</v>

3447
02:19:23.441 --> 02:19:25.690
<v Speaker 4>will just get out of dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

3448
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:29.540
<v Speaker 4>they'll own bitcoin and then we'll just</v>
<v Speaker 4>use bitcoin as money.</v>

3449
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

3450
02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:35.160
<v Speaker 4>and the idea is this is going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can't happen because there is no</v>

3451
02:19:35.271 --> 02:19:39.080
<v Speaker 4>value that ultimately bitcoin has that</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be stored right.</v>

3452
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:41.780
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because unlike gold gold actually has</v>

3453
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:42.980
<v Speaker 4>properties that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3454
02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:44.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use gold for all sorts of</v>

3455
02:19:44.751 --> 02:19:47.000
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People value gold for the metal.</v>

3456
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Nobody values bitcoin for the bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They value it because they believe that</v>

3457
02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 4>they can exchange it for something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's dollar doesn't really represent</v>

3458
02:19:55.521 --> 02:19:57.200
<v Speaker 4>golden anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it doesn't,</v>

3459
02:19:57.410 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 4>but just because the dollar is working</v>
<v Speaker 4>as money with all the history of usage</v>

3460
02:20:02.271 --> 02:20:04.490
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that the government except</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars,</v>

3461
02:20:04.491 --> 02:20:07.370
<v Speaker 4>his taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's legal tender that you have</v>

3462
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:10.160
<v Speaker 4>insurance products,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have rental agreements that you</v>

3463
02:20:10.161 --> 02:20:13.460
<v Speaker 4>have bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have an entire global market in in</v>

3464
02:20:13.461 --> 02:20:14.294
<v Speaker 4>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3465
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 4>That is never going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>develop with bitcoin or any other</v>

3466
02:20:17.691 --> 02:20:19.180
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3467
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:21.740
<v Speaker 4>ultimately the value of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3468
02:20:21.741 --> 02:20:23.900
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a cryptocurrency is,</v>

3469
02:20:23.901 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 4>is based on the willingness of somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else to accept it and exchange for,</v>

3470
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:28.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for something else.</v>

3471
02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when bitcoin first started and people</v>

3472
02:20:32.781 --> 02:20:33.980
<v Speaker 4>used to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3473
02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:36.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only 21 million bitcoins,</v>

3474
02:20:36.231 --> 02:20:37.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have any more than that.</v>

3475
02:20:37.850 --> 02:20:41.570
<v Speaker 4>So therefore there's some scarcity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my point was that,</v>

3476
02:20:41.571 --> 02:20:43.340
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what stops somebody else from</v>

3477
02:20:43.341 --> 02:20:47.790
<v Speaker 4>creating another cryptocurrency that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>identical to bitcoin?</v>

3478
02:20:47.810 --> 02:20:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe it's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's faster.</v>

3479
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it has properties that maybe it</v>
<v Speaker 4>improves on big.</v>

3480
02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Just like we talked about cell phones</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>

3481
02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 4>somebody bakes a better cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your,</v>

3482
02:20:57.770 --> 02:21:01.850
<v Speaker 4>what's your old Motorola phone worth</v>
<v Speaker 4>today is nothing,</v>

3483
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:03.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody comes up with a better</v>

3484
02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:06.260
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrency and then what's your</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin worth?</v>

3485
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:08.090
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think any of these,</v>

3486
02:21:08.091 --> 02:21:09.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have like a thousand of them.</v>

3487
02:21:09.411 --> 02:21:12.020
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The market cap is about 150 billion for</v>

3488
02:21:12.021 --> 02:21:14.480
<v Speaker 4>all these cryptocurrencies and now there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are people that are saying,</v>

3489
02:21:14.481 --> 02:21:15.590
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to buy a bunch of them.</v>

3490
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:17.480
<v Speaker 4>You need a portfolio because she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3491
02:21:17.481 --> 02:21:19.250
<v Speaker 4>you're not sure which one is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>win.</v>

3492
02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:22.460
<v Speaker 4>None of them are going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all going to lose because none</v>

3493
02:21:22.461 --> 02:21:26.090
<v Speaker 4>of them are going to work because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there and there's no store of</v>

3494
02:21:26.091 --> 02:21:26.661
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3495
02:21:26.661 --> 02:21:31.661
<v Speaker 4>your people are not using bitcoins and</v>
<v Speaker 4>nor will they ever use bitcoins as a</v>

3496
02:21:31.671 --> 02:21:34.580
<v Speaker 4>real medium of exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People use it as a speculative asset.</v>

3497
02:21:34.581 --> 02:21:37.130
<v Speaker 4>People buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hope it's going to go up in value.</v>

3498
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you sell your bitcoins and then buy</v>

3499
02:21:39.681 --> 02:21:41.480
<v Speaker 4>something with the money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3500
02:21:41.481 --> 02:21:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Do you could do that with any asset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3501
02:21:43.191 --> 02:21:46.460
<v Speaker 4>people make a big deal about the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that my gold company shift gold.</v>

3502
02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:47.870
<v Speaker 4>We accept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we say,</v>

3503
02:21:47.871 --> 02:21:48.860
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we accept bitcoin.</v>

3504
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:51.110
<v Speaker 4>We don't really accept Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3505
02:21:51.111 --> 02:21:55.190
<v Speaker 4>What we accept is dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we make it easy for people to sell</v>

3506
02:21:55.191 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 4>their bitcoins to buy dollars by using a</v>
<v Speaker 4>service called a bit pay,</v>

3507
02:22:00.020 --> 02:22:02.750
<v Speaker 4>but they're not actually using,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3508
02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:03.441
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3509
02:22:03.441 --> 02:22:04.274
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3510
02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:05.780
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a bitcoin.</v>

3511
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:08.420
<v Speaker 4>They're using dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're selling their bitcoin and then</v>

3512
02:22:08.421 --> 02:22:09.620
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're trading dollars.</v>

3513
02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:12.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Bitcoin and be ultimately works,</v>

3514
02:22:12.501 --> 02:22:14.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to work because I mean,</v>

3515
02:22:14.271 --> 02:22:17.720
<v Speaker 4>that is ultimately working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can use their bitcoin and you can</v>

3516
02:22:17.721 --> 02:22:19.700
<v Speaker 4>purchase gold with a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3517
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:22.820
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can sell your bitcoin to buy dollars</v>

3518
02:22:22.821 --> 02:22:25.640
<v Speaker 4>and then you can use the dollars to buy</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bitcoin,</v>

3519
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:27.960
<v Speaker 4>which meant nothing is worth dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3520
02:22:27.961 --> 02:22:28.800
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sold it.</v>

3521
02:22:28.801 --> 02:22:29.660
<v Speaker 4>You sold your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3522
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:32.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sold nothing to get dollars and he'd</v>

3523
02:22:32.441 --> 02:22:34.410
<v Speaker 4>take those dollars and you buy big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3524
02:22:34.411 --> 02:22:35.970
<v Speaker 4>you sold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sold something,</v>

3525
02:22:35.971 --> 02:22:38.680
<v Speaker 4>you sold it as the big question then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's something then,</v>

3526
02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3527
02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:43.500
<v Speaker 4>but you can sell it today for value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might be worthless tomorrow.</v>

3528
02:22:43.501 --> 02:22:44.251
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not right now.</v>

3529
02:22:44.251 --> 02:22:46.320
<v Speaker 4>It's not because somebody will pay you</v>
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>

3530
02:22:46.410 --> 02:22:48.510
<v Speaker 4>So it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing as a share of,</v>

3531
02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:49.171
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3532
02:22:49.171 --> 02:22:50.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pets.com.</v>

3533
02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.010
<v Speaker 4>At one point somebody would give you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of money for that stock and now</v>

3534
02:22:53.011 --> 02:22:54.300
<v Speaker 4>they'll give you nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3535
02:22:54.301 --> 02:22:56.040
<v Speaker 4>it's all about perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3536
02:22:56.130 --> 02:22:58.740
<v Speaker 4>there's always value in gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I hear people telling me this,</v>

3537
02:22:58.741 --> 02:22:59.161
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3538
02:22:59.161 --> 02:23:00.660
<v Speaker 4>gold's value is subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3539
02:23:00.661 --> 02:23:04.050
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's objective gold has value because it</v>

3540
02:23:04.051 --> 02:23:06.930
<v Speaker 4>satisfies a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3541
02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:09.540
<v Speaker 4>desires or needs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has properties that exist in the</v>

3542
02:23:09.541 --> 02:23:11.760
<v Speaker 4>physical world and there are things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do with it.</v>

3543
02:23:11.970 --> 02:23:15.210
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I can do with my bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 4>is give it to somebody else.</v>

3544
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:16.740
<v Speaker 4>But I know people think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3545
02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:19.020
<v Speaker 4>but the blockchain is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is so great.</v>

3546
02:23:19.021 --> 02:23:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the blockchain is a great</v>

3547
02:23:21.481 --> 02:23:24.600
<v Speaker 4>invention and maybe over time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of assets,</v>

3548
02:23:24.601 --> 02:23:27.420
<v Speaker 4>we'll utilize the blockchain in</v>
<v Speaker 4>transactions.</v>

3549
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:31.080
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't mean that just because</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin's utilize something of value</v>

3550
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:36.150
<v Speaker 4>that the bitcoin itself has any value</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is going to endure to the owner of</v>

3551
02:23:36.151 --> 02:23:37.470
<v Speaker 4>that bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially,</v>

3552
02:23:37.471 --> 02:23:39.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when there's an infinite number of</v>

3553
02:23:39.631 --> 02:23:41.250
<v Speaker 4>coins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's something interesting because</v>

3554
02:23:41.251 --> 02:23:42.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is,</v>

3555
02:23:42.961 --> 02:23:43.794
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3556
02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:48.860
<v Speaker 4>we need this digital gold because gold</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be used in commerce the way</v>

3557
02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:52.650
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The irony of it is it can,</v>

3558
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:54.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a company and you know,</v>

3559
02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it called gold money gold money.com and</v>

3560
02:23:57.961 --> 02:23:59.970
<v Speaker 4>you can go there and you can open up an</v>
<v Speaker 4>account.</v>

3561
02:23:59.971 --> 02:24:01.200
<v Speaker 4>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody listening should go to</v>

3562
02:24:01.201 --> 02:24:03.840
<v Speaker 4>goldmoney.com uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do it on your cell phone,</v>

3563
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:06.600
<v Speaker 4>on your APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they do is they allow you to</v>

3564
02:24:06.601 --> 02:24:08.880
<v Speaker 4>buy gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can also buy silver and platinum</v>

3565
02:24:08.881 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 4>play the amount of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's just focus on gold.</v>

3566
02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:15.330
<v Speaker 4>You can buy gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sell it to you for one half of 1%</v>

3567
02:24:15.331 --> 02:24:16.590
<v Speaker 4>over spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very cheap.</v>

3568
02:24:16.591 --> 02:24:18.210
<v Speaker 4>I've been in the gold business my whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

3569
02:24:18.211 --> 02:24:21.060
<v Speaker 4>I've never sold gold that cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You own the gold.</v>

3570
02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:24.570
<v Speaker 4>They will have a stored for you at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it brings vault of your choice and you</v>

3571
02:24:24.571 --> 02:24:28.950
<v Speaker 4>have different locations in Switzerland</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Hong Kong and Singapore and Canada.</v>

3572
02:24:28.951 --> 02:24:32.790
<v Speaker 4>You can pick where you want your gold</v>
<v Speaker 4>stored and now you own that gold,</v>

3573
02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:34.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in your digital wallet.</v>

3574
02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Just like you could have your crypto</v>
<v Speaker 4>currencies in a digital wallet,</v>

3575
02:24:37.350 --> 02:24:40.800
<v Speaker 4>but the difference is you can take</v>
<v Speaker 4>deliver of that gold whenever you want</v>

3576
02:24:40.801 --> 02:24:42.480
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The minimum is 10 grams of gold,</v>

3577
02:24:42.481 --> 02:24:45.840
<v Speaker 4>which is a very small quantity and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>will mail it to you if you want it.</v>

3578
02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:48.660
<v Speaker 4>But the purpose of it is not to have it</v>
<v Speaker 4>mailed to you.</v>

3579
02:24:48.690 --> 02:24:49.740
<v Speaker 4>You keep it in your account.</v>

3580
02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Now you can give that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are any portion of it to anyone</v>

3581
02:24:54.001 --> 02:24:57.900
<v Speaker 4>you want anywhere in the world for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can just transfer my ownership to</v>

3582
02:24:57.901 --> 02:25:00.510
<v Speaker 4>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now there's commerce.</v>

3583
02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:05.540
<v Speaker 4>If you are a merchant and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>price your product in gold,</v>

3584
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:09.990
<v Speaker 4>you can do that and I can pay for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>product using gold and you can accept</v>

3585
02:25:09.991 --> 02:25:12.540
<v Speaker 4>gold in exchange for that good or</v>
<v Speaker 4>service.</v>

3586
02:25:12.541 --> 02:25:17.400
<v Speaker 4>So it makes it so that now gold can</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually work in today's modern economy</v>

3587
02:25:17.401 --> 02:25:20.340
<v Speaker 4>through the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's now is easy for me to spend my</v>

3588
02:25:20.341 --> 02:25:21.990
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can use my goal to buy a cup of</v>

3589
02:25:21.991 --> 02:25:22.950
<v Speaker 4>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

3590
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:24.930
<v Speaker 4>my goal to buy a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3591
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.710
<v Speaker 4>So I and in the short run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3592
02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:30.940
<v Speaker 4>And I'll show you this car that I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the short run.</v>

3593
02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Let's assume that somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that a gold card and it's been an</v>

3594
02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:36.360
<v Speaker 4>actual gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's made out of actually go.</v>

3595
02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just real heavy.</v>

3596
02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause gold is crazy because gold is a</v>

3597
02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:40.660
<v Speaker 4>real element.</v>

3598
02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:42.460
<v Speaker 3>You have a guy has wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold credit card.</v>

3599
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:45.070
<v Speaker 3>This is a gold mastercard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

3600
02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.980
<v Speaker 3>This is a gold money mastercard and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3601
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:49.600
<v Speaker 3>this is heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like listen.</v>

3602
02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3603
02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean compare that to just a plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

3604
02:25:53.470 --> 02:25:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

3605
02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hundred of these.</v>

3606
02:25:56.530 --> 02:25:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is real.</v>

3607
02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3608
02:26:00.570 --> 02:26:00.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3609
02:26:00.971 --> 02:26:03.000
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3610
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:04.050
<v Speaker 3>I need one of those in my life.</v>

3611
02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Well you got woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will.</v>

3612
02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:06.600
<v Speaker 4>We'll make you one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed to get you one.</v>

3613
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:07.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is very appealing.</v>

3614
02:26:07.930 --> 02:26:08.763
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me finish this one.</v>

3615
02:26:08.810 --> 02:26:09.643
<v Speaker 4>This one point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3616
02:26:11.370 --> 02:26:12.750
<v Speaker 4>in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3617
02:26:12.751 --> 02:26:15.600
<v Speaker 4>I believe that we're going to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gold standard,</v>

3618
02:26:15.601 --> 02:26:17.430
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just gold money,</v>

3619
02:26:17.431 --> 02:26:19.410
<v Speaker 4>but gold money might be the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>company to do that.</v>

3620
02:26:19.411 --> 02:26:21.120
<v Speaker 4>But there may be more that we'll do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>later on.</v>

3621
02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:24.120
<v Speaker 4>But I think that government Fiat money</v>
<v Speaker 4>does not work.</v>

3622
02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Dollars won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uros won't work.</v>

3623
02:26:26.071 --> 02:26:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Yen don't won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But gold works.</v>

3624
02:26:28.171 --> 02:26:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Gold has worked for thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now with the Internet it works even</v>

3625
02:26:32.341 --> 02:26:35.290
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that gold,</v>

3626
02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:39.450
<v Speaker 4>like through gold money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold money we'll do to Fiat currency,</v>

3627
02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>what Fedex did to the post office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Uber is doing to taxi cabs,</v>

3628
02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:46.070
<v Speaker 4>it is the free markets alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3629
02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:50.370
<v Speaker 4>money that government can't create out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of thin air that will hold its value</v>

3630
02:26:50.371 --> 02:26:51.210
<v Speaker 4>over time.</v>

3631
02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:52.920
<v Speaker 4>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks to the Internet,</v>

3632
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:54.900
<v Speaker 4>we can be used in commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the meantime,</v>

3633
02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:57.060
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I've got gold that is stored in my</v>

3634
02:26:57.061 --> 02:26:59.910
<v Speaker 4>gold money account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let's say I go to a merchant who</v>

3635
02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:02.160
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want gold cause he doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>any better.</v>

3636
02:27:02.190 --> 02:27:05.820
<v Speaker 4>He just wants to be paid in dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can use this debit card,</v>

3637
02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:07.680
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to buy something.</v>

3638
02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:10.470
<v Speaker 4>And is that a debit card or credit card?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debit card,</v>

3639
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:13.740
<v Speaker 4>debit card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a debit card and you can't tell</v>

3640
02:27:13.741 --> 02:27:14.281
<v Speaker 4>the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3641
02:27:14.281 --> 02:27:19.281
<v Speaker 4>But what happens is I can spend my goal</v>
<v Speaker 4>using this card so I can sell off</v>

3642
02:27:19.561 --> 02:27:22.080
<v Speaker 4>basically just like you know when people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing with bit pay,</v>

3643
02:27:22.081 --> 02:27:23.370
<v Speaker 4>but I don't need bitpay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3644
02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I can go to any merchant in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>that accepts mastercard and my gold will</v>

3645
02:27:29.311 --> 02:27:31.920
<v Speaker 4>be sold and the merchant will get</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars,</v>

3646
02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:32.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3647
02:27:32.190 --> 02:27:37.190
<v Speaker 4>So I can spend my gold now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the merchant is actually not getting</v>

3648
02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:41.040
<v Speaker 4>rolled these getting dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I believe in the future the</v>

3649
02:27:41.041 --> 02:27:42.810
<v Speaker 4>merchant's going to want gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3650
02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:46.590
<v Speaker 4>once we start to get a currency crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once we see the euro and the yen blowing</v>

3651
02:27:46.591 --> 02:27:48.690
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are not going to want to sell</v>

3652
02:27:48.691 --> 02:27:50.910
<v Speaker 4>their goods and services for paper</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

3653
02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:52.800
<v Speaker 4>They're going to want to sell it for</v>
<v Speaker 4>real money.</v>

3654
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Now there are people think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3655
02:27:53.891 --> 02:27:56.460
<v Speaker 4>they're going to want to sell it for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for cryptocurrencies.</v>

3656
02:27:56.461 --> 02:27:56.941
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

3657
02:27:56.941 --> 02:28:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I think he's cryptocurrencies are going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to crash before the Fiat currencies.</v>

3658
02:28:00.481 --> 02:28:02.970
<v Speaker 4>I think they're going to make Fiat</v>
<v Speaker 4>currencies look good.</v>

3659
02:28:02.971 --> 02:28:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Which is unfortunate because you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of good people who are putting their</v>

3660
02:28:06.871 --> 02:28:09.150
<v Speaker 4>faith in these cryptocurrencies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get burned.</v>

3661
02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:10.680
<v Speaker 4>And then the government's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>

3662
02:28:10.681 --> 02:28:12.990
<v Speaker 4>we told you the free market isn't any</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

3663
02:28:13.170 --> 02:28:14.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to trust us.</v>

3664
02:28:14.461 --> 02:28:16.020
<v Speaker 4>You got to trust our paper money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3665
02:28:16.021 --> 02:28:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to trust gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to trust the private sector and</v>

3666
02:28:19.501 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 4>if I can use gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I use anything else?</v>

3667
02:28:22.101 --> 02:28:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Now I know people say the knocked at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin people say is that,</v>

3668
02:28:25.671 --> 02:28:28.130
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not decentralized because somebody</v>

3669
02:28:28.131 --> 02:28:29.990
<v Speaker 4>has to store the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3670
02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:30.824
<v Speaker 4>Whereas nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3671
02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:32.930
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's real value there.</v>

3672
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:36.110
<v Speaker 4>But you know what brings has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>storing gold for over a hundred years</v>

3673
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:38.390
<v Speaker 4>and they've never lost an ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>

3674
02:28:38.450 --> 02:28:42.440
<v Speaker 4>I trust banks to hold my gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're holding it in a way that I</v>

3675
02:28:42.441 --> 02:28:43.760
<v Speaker 4>can spend it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3676
02:28:43.761 --> 02:28:44.750
<v Speaker 4>back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3677
02:28:44.751 --> 02:28:48.620
<v Speaker 4>The first currencies that existed were</v>
<v Speaker 4>created by private banks,</v>

3678
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:49.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not The government.</v>

3679
02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:52.820
<v Speaker 4>And so a bank would have gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or actually even before that,</v>

3680
02:28:52.821 --> 02:28:55.010
<v Speaker 4>it was the goldsmith who would have</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold,</v>

3681
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:57.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was storing and he would write</v>

3682
02:28:57.081 --> 02:28:58.910
<v Speaker 4>an Iou and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3683
02:28:58.911 --> 02:29:00.020
<v Speaker 4>and the person would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3684
02:29:00.021 --> 02:29:03.260
<v Speaker 4>I've got gold stored at this goldsmith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that piece of paper,</v>

3685
02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:03.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3686
02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Instead of going back to the Goldsmith</v>
<v Speaker 4>and getting your gold,</v>

3687
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:08.090
<v Speaker 4>you can give somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

3688
02:29:08.091 --> 02:29:09.440
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I owe you money.</v>

3689
02:29:09.470 --> 02:29:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Take this note because the gold is</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3690
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Th you can go get it whenever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's a piece of paper.</v>

3691
02:29:14.601 --> 02:29:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Put it in your wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It entitles you to that goal.</v>

3692
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.340
<v Speaker 4>And that piece of paper could circulate</v>
<v Speaker 4>as money,</v>

3693
02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:22.700
<v Speaker 4>not because it has value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because it's backed up by the goal.</v>

3694
02:29:22.850 --> 02:29:26.120
<v Speaker 4>And so eventually private banks started</v>
<v Speaker 4>issuing currency,</v>

3695
02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:29.450
<v Speaker 4>physical paper currency that was backed</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the goal that they had.</v>

3696
02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:31.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're having now in,</v>

3697
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:32.750
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in with gold,</v>

3698
02:29:32.751 --> 02:29:36.020
<v Speaker 4>money is gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money is like the Goldsmith.</v>

3699
02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 4>They're storing your gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instead of giving the person that</v>

3700
02:29:40.610 --> 02:29:44.390
<v Speaker 4>the piece of paper that you can go back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually get ownership.</v>

3701
02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.960
<v Speaker 4>You actually transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I was going to give you $100 worth</v>

3702
02:29:47.961 --> 02:29:50.330
<v Speaker 4>of gold from my gold money account to</v>
<v Speaker 4>your gold money account,</v>

3703
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:52.620
<v Speaker 4>you're going to now have title to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>

3704
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:55.700
<v Speaker 4>It's changing hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gone from me owning the golden,</v>

3705
02:29:55.701 --> 02:29:57.860
<v Speaker 4>that vault to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>owning that exact same goal.</v>

3706
02:29:57.890 --> 02:29:58.723
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your goal?</v>

3707
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:01.490
<v Speaker 4>You can do whatever you want with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could take delivery of it and have</v>

3708
02:30:01.491 --> 02:30:04.220
<v Speaker 4>it in your hand or you can use it to buy</v>
<v Speaker 4>something else.</v>

3709
02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:08.450
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the free market money and we could</v>

3710
02:30:08.451 --> 02:30:09.950
<v Speaker 4>use it costless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3711
02:30:09.951 --> 02:30:12.350
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cheaper than mastercard,</v>

3712
02:30:12.351 --> 02:30:15.350
<v Speaker 4>visa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very inexpensive way for people</v>

3713
02:30:15.351 --> 02:30:18.890
<v Speaker 4>to trade across borders because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter what country you live in.</v>

3714
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:22.280
<v Speaker 4>Gold has value in every country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to worry about the yen or</v>

3715
02:30:22.281 --> 02:30:23.690
<v Speaker 4>the euro or the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3716
02:30:23.691 --> 02:30:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to sell my products.</v>

3717
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:28.340
<v Speaker 4>I can price them in gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Gold is not very volatile.</v>

3718
02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Gold as a relatively stable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over time,</v>

3719
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:34.640
<v Speaker 4>you can actually price a product and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid in gold and you can store your gold</v>

3720
02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:36.050
<v Speaker 4>and a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two years later,</v>

3721
02:30:36.051 --> 02:30:36.330
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3722
02:30:36.330 --> 02:30:39.150
<v Speaker 4>It's going to have value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or You could look at the historic,</v>

3723
02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:40.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a value of gold.</v>

3724
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:43.430
<v Speaker 4>So rather than trying to reinvent the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheel,</v>

3725
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:44.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to have something,</v>

3726
02:30:44.570 --> 02:30:45.830
<v Speaker 4>they call it alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3727
02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:47.570
<v Speaker 4>it's hundreds of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3728
02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:50.780
<v Speaker 4>the alchemists tried to make gold at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>base metal and they couldn't do it.</v>

3729
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:53.990
<v Speaker 4>I look at these cryptocurrencies as</v>
<v Speaker 4>modern day alchemy.</v>

3730
02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:58.220
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to digitally recreate</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold and they're not going to succeed.</v>

3731
02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:01.460
<v Speaker 4>They're just creating digital Fiat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fool's gold.</v>

3732
02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have made money speculating on</v>

3733
02:31:03.561 --> 02:31:05.480
<v Speaker 4>other people's ignorance and other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's greed,</v>

3734
02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:08.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to end very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do believe that,</v>

3735
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:10.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing to gold money and</v>

3736
02:31:10.221 --> 02:31:13.760
<v Speaker 4>what the Internet is enabling is that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can have real money.</v>

3737
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:16.390
<v Speaker 4>We can use gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now in a way that you know,</v>

3738
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:21.180
<v Speaker 4>our forefathers never could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a real modern day gold standard</v>

3739
02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:22.350
<v Speaker 4>2.0 gold.</v>

3740
02:31:22.350 --> 02:31:25.620
<v Speaker 4>Woolworth worked better as money today</v>
<v Speaker 4>than it's ever worked before,</v>

3741
02:31:25.621 --> 02:31:27.090
<v Speaker 4>and it worked great in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3742
02:31:27.091 --> 02:31:30.210
<v Speaker 4>we thrived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>America was built on a gold standard.</v>

3743
02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:33.480
<v Speaker 4>The industrial revolution happened on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold standard.</v>

3744
02:31:33.481 --> 02:31:37.560
<v Speaker 4>We produced a wealthiest country the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world had ever seen on a gold standard,</v>

3745
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:38.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've become broke,</v>

3746
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:40.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>With his Fiat's standard.</v>

3747
02:31:40.441 --> 02:31:43.680
<v Speaker 4>We've squandered the wealth that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>created under a gold standard.</v>

3748
02:31:43.681 --> 02:31:44.910
<v Speaker 4>But this is a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3749
02:31:44.911 --> 02:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>when Nixon took us off the gold standard</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1971 he said it was temporary,</v>

3750
02:31:48.930 --> 02:31:49.763
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3751
02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.710
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to wait for the government</v>
<v Speaker 4>to bring us back to a gold center.</v>

3752
02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:53.880
<v Speaker 4>You could do it on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3753
02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:56.520
<v Speaker 4>You can put yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people can now move to a gold standard.</v>

3754
02:31:56.700 --> 02:32:00.060
<v Speaker 4>You can earn a companies can pay their</v>
<v Speaker 4>employees using gold money.</v>

3755
02:32:00.061 --> 02:32:03.180
<v Speaker 4>They could pay him and gold people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>landlords can collect rent and gold.</v>

3756
02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:05.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope we can have an entire society.</v>

3757
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:07.440
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now we're being sidetracked by</v>

3758
02:32:07.441 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by this bubble in the,</v>

3759
02:32:08.971 --> 02:32:11.160
<v Speaker 4>in the cryptocurrencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the people who are buying these</v>

3760
02:32:11.161 --> 02:32:14.940
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies should be buying gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course what they can do now is,</v>

3761
02:32:14.941 --> 02:32:16.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you happen to have some</v>

3762
02:32:16.171 --> 02:32:17.610
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can sell them,</v>

3763
02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.410
<v Speaker 4>you can go to gold money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll take your,</v>

3764
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:24.180
<v Speaker 4>they'll let you convert your bitcoins</v>
<v Speaker 4>are all coins or whatever,</v>

3765
02:32:24.181 --> 02:32:25.260
<v Speaker 4>whatever you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3766
02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:27.300
<v Speaker 4>ether,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever crypto you can go and you</v>

3767
02:32:27.301 --> 02:32:29.370
<v Speaker 4>convert it and you can buy real money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3768
02:32:29.371 --> 02:32:30.930
<v Speaker 4>And then when this bubble pops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3769
02:32:30.931 --> 02:32:31.764
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3770
02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:32.431
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3771
02:32:32.431 --> 02:32:35.100
<v Speaker 4>you're not left holding the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause a lot of people I think</v>

3772
02:32:35.101 --> 02:32:38.880
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately are going to end up losing</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of their real,</v>

3773
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:40.230
<v Speaker 4>their money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their purchasing power.</v>

3774
02:32:40.231 --> 02:32:42.540
<v Speaker 4>They could have bought gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instead they bought,</v>

3775
02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:44.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pets.com and they,</v>

3776
02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:46.080
<v Speaker 4>and they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't realize that that's what</v>

3777
02:32:46.081 --> 02:32:47.430
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they were buying.</v>

3778
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:50.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm sold Peter Schiff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the car.</v>

3779
02:32:50.451 --> 02:32:51.930
<v Speaker 4>If you just get people to hold on to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3780
02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean in their hand was like this</v>

3781
02:32:53.821 --> 02:32:54.840
<v Speaker 4>is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3782
02:32:54.841 --> 02:32:56.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and always complained about the loss of</v>

3783
02:32:56.521 --> 02:32:57.630
<v Speaker 4>the gold standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3784
02:32:57.631 --> 02:32:59.820
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a longstanding complaint.</v>

3785
02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:01.860
<v Speaker 4>You go back to the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3786
02:33:01.890 --> 02:33:03.450
<v Speaker 4>Gold is money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the constitution.</v>

3787
02:33:03.451 --> 02:33:06.570
<v Speaker 4>It says that no state shall make</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything but gold and silver coin,</v>

3788
02:33:06.571 --> 02:33:09.750
<v Speaker 4>legal tender payment of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The federal government is only given the</v>

3789
02:33:09.751 --> 02:33:12.060
<v Speaker 4>power to coin money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they coining?</v>

3790
02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Gold and silver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that that is,</v>

3791
02:33:14.610 --> 02:33:16.620
<v Speaker 4>is the standard that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

3792
02:33:16.621 --> 02:33:18.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time we mentioned the civil</v>

3793
02:33:18.450 --> 02:33:20.400
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time we ever had paper money</v>

3794
02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:23.060
<v Speaker 4>in America was during the civil war and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3795
02:33:23.061 --> 02:33:24.660
<v Speaker 4>the union issued it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

3796
02:33:24.661 --> 02:33:25.520
<v Speaker 4>it was the greenback.</v>

3797
02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:28.350
<v Speaker 4>It was backed by gold and when the war</v>
<v Speaker 4>ended,</v>

3798
02:33:28.410 --> 02:33:32.160
<v Speaker 4>they stopped issuing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they issued it based on an emergency</v>

3799
02:33:32.161 --> 02:33:34.950
<v Speaker 4>wartime power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that they had the right to do</v>

3800
02:33:34.951 --> 02:33:36.420
<v Speaker 4>it legally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

3801
02:33:36.421 --> 02:33:37.350
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a war.</v>

3802
02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:40.380
<v Speaker 4>We need to win this war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the first time we had</v>

3803
02:33:40.381 --> 02:33:41.790
<v Speaker 4>paper money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it went away.</v>

3804
02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:44.850
<v Speaker 4>It didn't come back again until 1913</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the Federal Reserve.</v>

3805
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Is it really possible that this can make</v>
<v Speaker 4>a return?</v>

3806
02:33:47.490 --> 02:33:49.680
<v Speaker 4>What can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gold standard can actually be</v>

3807
02:33:49.681 --> 02:33:52.830
<v Speaker 4>something that we all go off and I am</v>
<v Speaker 4>convinced that we're going back to a</v>

3808
02:33:52.831 --> 02:33:55.410
<v Speaker 4>gold standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the free market will lead</v>

3809
02:33:55.411 --> 02:33:58.620
<v Speaker 4>the way because if people start</v>
<v Speaker 4>rejecting government money,</v>

3810
02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:00.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they start rejecting the dollar,</v>

3811
02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:02.100
<v Speaker 4>if they reject it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe,</v>

3812
02:34:02.101 --> 02:34:04.140
<v Speaker 4>they reject again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then what does the governor going to do?</v>

3813
02:34:04.141 --> 02:34:06.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the source of the government's power</v>

3814
02:34:06.001 --> 02:34:07.290
<v Speaker 4>really is the money they spent.</v>

3815
02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:09.540
<v Speaker 4>That's where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they buy their votes and they peddle</v>

3816
02:34:09.541 --> 02:34:11.070
<v Speaker 4>their influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if,</v>

3817
02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:13.620
<v Speaker 4>if individuals and merchants just start</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

3818
02:34:13.650 --> 02:34:15.450
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that paper money.</v>

3819
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 4>You want to buy my products,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay and goal,</v>

3820
02:34:17.890 --> 02:34:19.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want my services,</v>

3821
02:34:19.271 --> 02:34:22.240
<v Speaker 4>pay me in gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if more and more people start opting</v>

3822
02:34:22.241 --> 02:34:26.010
<v Speaker 4>out of that system and just start</v>
<v Speaker 4>working in a gold back month,</v>

3823
02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:28.390
<v Speaker 4>which we know works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't need the government to make</v>

3824
02:34:28.391 --> 02:34:30.730
<v Speaker 4>gold money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold was money long before the</v>

3825
02:34:30.731 --> 02:34:32.980
<v Speaker 4>government came around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the government did is when they</v>

3826
02:34:32.981 --> 02:34:34.030
<v Speaker 4>took over money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3827
02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:34.864
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3828
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:35.950
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would debase it,</v>

3829
02:34:35.951 --> 02:34:37.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the term comes.</v>

3830
02:34:37.361 --> 02:34:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Because the government would start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would make gold coins and they</v>

3831
02:34:39.581 --> 02:34:42.100
<v Speaker 4>would stick copper in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other metals because they would try to</v>

3832
02:34:42.101 --> 02:34:44.350
<v Speaker 4>create inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you had private money,</v>

3833
02:34:44.830 --> 02:34:45.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3834
02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:46.413
<v Speaker 4>it was gold.</v>

3835
02:34:46.570 --> 02:34:50.320
<v Speaker 4>And so we don't need the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is these cryptocurrencies,</v>

3836
02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:53.530
<v Speaker 4>they're being marketed as the private</v>
<v Speaker 4>sector's alternative.</v>

3837
02:34:53.531 --> 02:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>It's not gold is the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we now have,</v>

3838
02:34:58.030 --> 02:34:58.410
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3839
02:34:58.410 --> 02:35:01.060
<v Speaker 4>we now have the method of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of using goals,</v>

3840
02:35:01.090 --> 02:35:01.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I,</v>

3841
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:03.190
<v Speaker 4>when I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this in my wallet,</v>

3842
02:35:03.191 --> 02:35:04.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can carry,</v>

3843
02:35:05.130 --> 02:35:06.450
<v Speaker 4>but I can carry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3844
02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:10.210
<v Speaker 4>if I have a $100,000 worth of gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have $100,000 in this wallet.</v>

3845
02:35:10.270 --> 02:35:13.660
<v Speaker 4>It's here and I can use it to buy a pack</v>
<v Speaker 4>of chewing gum.</v>

3846
02:35:13.810 --> 02:35:16.930
<v Speaker 4>I could use it to buy a flat screen TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can use it to buy a car.</v>

3847
02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can buy tiny things with it.</v>

3848
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:21.670
<v Speaker 4>I could buy expensive things with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here it is.</v>

3849
02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm carrying it around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3850
02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:24.700
<v Speaker 4>And I can use it through my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

3851
02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:25.240
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

3852
02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:28.270
<v Speaker 4>my cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could take my cell phone and pay for</v>

3853
02:35:28.271 --> 02:35:33.271
<v Speaker 4>stuff and ownership of my gold will</v>
<v Speaker 4>instantly transfer to a third party.</v>

3854
02:35:33.730 --> 02:35:36.550
<v Speaker 4>And of course if you want to gift money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I want to give money to my kids,</v>

3855
02:35:36.551 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 4>I can give them gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they can spend it,</v>

3856
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:40.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can spend that using their debit</v>

3857
02:35:40.451 --> 02:35:43.060
<v Speaker 4>card or they can directly spend it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is the real ultra,</v>

3858
02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:45.820
<v Speaker 4>this is what these cryptocurrencies are</v>
<v Speaker 4>promising to be.</v>

3859
02:35:45.821 --> 02:35:48.490
<v Speaker 4>But they never will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think a lot of people are getting</v>

3860
02:35:48.491 --> 02:35:49.920
<v Speaker 4>greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think,</v>

3861
02:35:49.921 --> 02:35:51.820
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things are going to be worth $1</v>

3862
02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:54.160
<v Speaker 4>million a piece and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pie in the sky.</v>

3863
02:35:54.161 --> 02:35:58.060
<v Speaker 4>And it's like that greed overwhelms them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can't think rationally.</v>

3864
02:35:58.270 --> 02:35:59.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in anybody that doesn't agree with them,</v>

3865
02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:02.890
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had the same mentality,</v>

3866
02:36:03.430 --> 02:36:06.340
<v Speaker 4>permeates every bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People can't think rationally.</v>

3867
02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:08.590
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the price goes up,</v>

3868
02:36:08.591 --> 02:36:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you just become more emboldened in what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you believe because you're getting</v>

3869
02:36:11.621 --> 02:36:13.990
<v Speaker 4>rewarded by the market for your mistake.</v>

3870
02:36:14.050 --> 02:36:16.570
<v Speaker 4>But you don't think it's a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're getting rich and you're</v>

3871
02:36:16.571 --> 02:36:18.190
<v Speaker 4>looking at people like me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3872
02:36:18.191 --> 02:36:18.571
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>y'all,</v>

3873
02:36:18.571 --> 02:36:19.550
<v Speaker 4>you know Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not buying.</v>

3874
02:36:19.551 --> 02:36:20.950
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at all the money he's not making.</v>

3875
02:36:20.951 --> 02:36:22.420
<v Speaker 4>He's a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should be buying these</v>

3876
02:36:22.421 --> 02:36:25.270
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies so you know there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an old expression to don't</v>

3877
02:36:25.271 --> 02:36:28.960
<v Speaker 4>confuse brains with a bull market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certainly a bull market in</v>

3878
02:36:28.961 --> 02:36:30.790
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a bubble,</v>

3879
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:32.830
<v Speaker 4>and I think that people who are making</v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

3880
02:36:33.010 --> 02:36:34.630
<v Speaker 4>some of them are going to get lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3881
02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:37.450
<v Speaker 4>Some people are going to cash out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to make money,</v>

3882
02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:41.560
<v Speaker 4>but the money that people make is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to match the money that people lose</v>

3883
02:36:41.561 --> 02:36:43.750
<v Speaker 4>because you're going to have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are going to come in late to</v>

3884
02:36:43.751 --> 02:36:45.940
<v Speaker 4>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to buy and they're going</v>

3885
02:36:45.941 --> 02:36:46.990
<v Speaker 4>to be left holding the bag.</v>

3886
02:36:47.170 --> 02:36:47.681
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

3887
02:36:47.681 --> 02:36:49.900
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a lot of losses that</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't real money.</v>

3888
02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Let's say somebody bought bitcoin few</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and they paid $1,000 and now</v>

3889
02:36:54.101 --> 02:36:57.820
<v Speaker 4>it's worth 100,000 but they haven't sold</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they think it's going to 10</v>

3890
02:36:57.820 --> 02:36:58.600
<v Speaker 4>million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3891
02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:01.750
<v Speaker 4>If it goes to zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all they lost was a thousand right?</v>

3892
02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:06.400
<v Speaker 4>Even though it was worth 100,000 but</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally they lost a lot more because</v>

3893
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:09.380
<v Speaker 4>they thought they had all this money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3894
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:13.060
<v Speaker 4>And mentally they got used to have ela</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to be even more so</v>

3895
02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:15.590
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a lot of dreams that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to shattered,</v>

3896
02:37:15.591 --> 02:37:17.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause a lot of paper profits are going</v>

3897
02:37:17.711 --> 02:37:20.480
<v Speaker 4>to just go to money heaven because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just not going to be there.</v>

3898
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:24.260
<v Speaker 4>But ultimately the only real money</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be made is by the people</v>

3899
02:37:24.261 --> 02:37:26.480
<v Speaker 4>who cash out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause because this is just a,</v>

3900
02:37:26.481 --> 02:37:28.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a self generating Ponzi scheme.</v>

3901
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:31.070
<v Speaker 4>It's all about you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>needing new people.</v>

3902
02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:33.740
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I think a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people into the cryptocurrencies,</v>

3903
02:37:33.741 --> 02:37:37.490
<v Speaker 4>they get so upset when somebody like me</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get it because they need more</v>

3904
02:37:37.491 --> 02:37:39.140
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need a bigger market,</v>

3905
02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:42.890
<v Speaker 4>they need more buyers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To come in to keep paying a higher price</v>

3906
02:37:42.891 --> 02:37:45.980
<v Speaker 4>to keep it all going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if somebody comes out and cause,</v>

3907
02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:48.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say the emperor has no clothes,</v>

3908
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if a lot of people decided they</v>

3909
02:37:50.481 --> 02:37:53.630
<v Speaker 4>wanted to sell their cryptocurrencies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the price would collapse.</v>

3910
02:37:53.631 --> 02:37:54.800
<v Speaker 4>And then what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3911
02:37:54.801 --> 02:37:58.010
<v Speaker 4>what happens if bitcoin goes from 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 1000,</v>

3912
02:37:58.070 --> 02:38:00.410
<v Speaker 4>how do you now make an argument that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's money?</v>

3913
02:38:00.530 --> 02:38:02.780
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you console the people that</v>

3914
02:38:02.781 --> 02:38:07.220
<v Speaker 4>bought it at 4,000 and now it's at 1000</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what if it goes to 100 and then</v>

3915
02:38:07.221 --> 02:38:08.240
<v Speaker 4>what if it goes to zero?</v>

3916
02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:08.931
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3917
02:38:08.931 --> 02:38:12.320
<v Speaker 4>there was a time bitcoin went up to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand and then it went down to 200</v>

3918
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:14.660
<v Speaker 4>and then it rallied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now people are convinced,</v>

3919
02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:15.920
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well if it sells off,</v>

3920
02:38:15.921 --> 02:38:17.780
<v Speaker 4>it's just going to rally back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if it doesn't?</v>

3921
02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:19.370
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have to come.</v>

3922
02:38:19.371 --> 02:38:22.280
<v Speaker 4>They can keep on falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially since there's so many,</v>

3923
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:25.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies now that compete with</v>

3924
02:38:25.731 --> 02:38:26.421
<v Speaker 4>Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3925
02:38:26.421 --> 02:38:26.961
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've said,</v>

3926
02:38:26.961 --> 02:38:29.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people search on,</v>

3927
02:38:29.931 --> 02:38:31.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on yahoo versus Google?</v>

3928
02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yahoo was before Google or how many</v>

3929
02:38:34.341 --> 02:38:36.200
<v Speaker 4>people are on my space today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3930
02:38:36.201 --> 02:38:37.034
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3931
02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:38.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't on facebook.</v>

3932
02:38:38.211 --> 02:38:39.740
<v Speaker 4>So how do you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

3933
02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.090
<v Speaker 4>that bitcoin isn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the myspace of cryptocurrencies.</v>

3934
02:38:44.091 --> 02:38:45.650
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think any of these</v>

3935
02:38:45.651 --> 02:38:48.530
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies will work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do think they will work at,</v>

3936
02:38:48.531 --> 02:38:49.610
<v Speaker 4>they backed them by gold.</v>

3937
02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.920
<v Speaker 4>You can have a cryptocurrency backed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold.</v>

3938
02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:55.220
<v Speaker 4>The only problem there is the government</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't like that because that'll work so</v>

3939
02:38:55.221 --> 02:38:57.050
<v Speaker 4>well that the government will shut it</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

3940
02:38:57.051 --> 02:38:59.150
<v Speaker 4>The government will go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why like how will they</v>

3941
02:38:59.151 --> 02:39:00.050
<v Speaker 4>shut it down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3942
02:39:00.051 --> 02:39:02.240
<v Speaker 4>they might say there's money laundering</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on,</v>

3943
02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:04.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's why gold money,</v>

3944
02:39:04.101 --> 02:39:06.110
<v Speaker 4>see gold money does all the know your</v>
<v Speaker 4>customer.</v>

3945
02:39:06.111 --> 02:39:09.470
<v Speaker 4>They know all the k you kyc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you open up a gold money account</v>

3946
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:12.950
<v Speaker 4>and you own physical gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do make sure they get your photo</v>

3947
02:39:12.951 --> 02:39:14.960
<v Speaker 4>id.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get all this information on you.</v>

3948
02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:16.430
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're d,</v>

3949
02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:18.710
<v Speaker 4>they're complying with government rules</v>
<v Speaker 4>and regulations.</v>

3950
02:39:18.711 --> 02:39:19.820
<v Speaker 4>So there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

3951
02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.890
<v Speaker 4>nobody's extorting money using gold</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

3952
02:39:21.891 --> 02:39:23.660
<v Speaker 4>There's no criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is where,</v>

3953
02:39:23.661 --> 02:39:24.170
<v Speaker 4>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3954
02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:26.660
<v Speaker 4>people have argued in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've pointed out that yes,</v>

3955
02:39:26.780 --> 02:39:31.780
<v Speaker 4>the one place that bitcoin seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>used as money is in crime,</v>

3956
02:39:31.851 --> 02:39:32.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3957
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.870
<v Speaker 4>If I was going to blackmail you and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to threaten to shut down your</v>

3958
02:39:35.871 --> 02:39:38.390
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you send me some money,</v>

3959
02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:42.560
<v Speaker 4>I can demand payment in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I'm doing that is because</v>

3960
02:39:42.561 --> 02:39:44.360
<v Speaker 4>of the anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

3961
02:39:44.361 --> 02:39:46.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get away with the crime and I</v>

3962
02:39:46.521 --> 02:39:50.570
<v Speaker 4>don't care if the bitcoin loses 20% of</v>
<v Speaker 4>its value between the time you give it</v>

3963
02:39:50.571 --> 02:39:54.200
<v Speaker 4>to me at the time I cash it in because</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminals are used to paying to launder</v>

3964
02:39:54.201 --> 02:39:56.180
<v Speaker 4>their money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just want whatever they get is</v>

3965
02:39:56.181 --> 02:39:57.410
<v Speaker 4>gravy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3966
02:39:57.411 --> 02:39:59.990
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a merchant and I'm selling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sell gold,</v>

3967
02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:02.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sell gold and my margin and my gold</v>

3968
02:40:02.321 --> 02:40:07.321
<v Speaker 4>business is about 1% so if I sell gold</v>
<v Speaker 4>for $10,000 I bought it for 990 right?</v>

3969
02:40:09.201 --> 02:40:12.830
<v Speaker 4>I have a little bit of profit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't afford to do that business in.</v>

3970
02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:16.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean the bitcoin can move 2% I wiped</v>
<v Speaker 4>out all my profit and I've lost money.</v>

3971
02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:19.920
<v Speaker 4>I need something that is very stable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I'm a criminal,</v>

3972
02:40:19.921 --> 02:40:23.370
<v Speaker 4>just extorting money doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it can work for criminals,</v>

3973
02:40:23.371 --> 02:40:25.560
<v Speaker 4>but that's where the governments could</v>
<v Speaker 4>crack down on it.</v>

3974
02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:27.180
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta I gotta wrap this up.</v>

3975
02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:30.060
<v Speaker 4>So if people wanted to get involved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3976
02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:32.810
<v Speaker 4>what would be the best resource for them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get information?</v>

3977
02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:33.990
<v Speaker 4>How to get started?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3978
02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:37.980
<v Speaker 4>they should go to the website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goldmoney.com just open up an account</v>

3979
02:40:37.981 --> 02:40:40.020
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the beauty of this is to,</v>

3980
02:40:40.021 --> 02:40:43.530
<v Speaker 4>and you could do this yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a referral program that as you</v>

3981
02:40:43.531 --> 02:40:45.510
<v Speaker 4>refer people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you send them your own link.</v>

3982
02:40:45.511 --> 02:40:47.760
<v Speaker 4>So once you open up your gold money</v>
<v Speaker 4>account,</v>

3983
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:50.400
<v Speaker 4>you get a referral link and now you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>send it to your friend.</v>

3984
02:40:50.401 --> 02:40:52.770
<v Speaker 4>And now if they open up an account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get some free gold.</v>

3985
02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:54.980
<v Speaker 4>So you actually get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3986
02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:57.630
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so as you educate people,</v>

3987
02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:01.650
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like a marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they will compensate you in an extra</v>

3988
02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:02.700
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3989
02:41:02.701 --> 02:41:04.980
<v Speaker 4>and when you open up your account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll give you a little free gold.</v>

3990
02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:08.640
<v Speaker 4>You get a little free gold for referring</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody to sponsor it on this podcast.</v>

3991
02:41:08.641 --> 02:41:10.280
<v Speaker 4>You should be a little bit of free</v>
<v Speaker 4>google.</v>

3992
02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:11.330
<v Speaker 4>Yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3993
02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:13.400
<v Speaker 4>in fact the number of people that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have on the podcast,</v>

3994
02:41:13.470 --> 02:41:16.550
<v Speaker 4>you can get a lot of free goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you could have a big ad,</v>

3995
02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:21.000
<v Speaker 4>like our whole podcast was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big fake ad for Frigo.</v>

3996
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>

3997
02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:24.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really for the concepts of freedom.</v>

3998
02:41:24.241 --> 02:41:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Gold is economic freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3999
02:41:26.191 --> 02:41:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's like even Alan Greenspan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the title of his essay.</v>

4000
02:41:28.981 --> 02:41:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Gold and economic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is,</v>

4001
02:41:31.530 --> 02:41:35.070
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more people that we can move into</v>

4002
02:41:35.071 --> 02:41:38.760
<v Speaker 4>their own personal gold standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more people that can save in gold.</v>

4003
02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:40.290
<v Speaker 4>And the beauty of like a gold money</v>
<v Speaker 4>account.</v>

4004
02:41:40.291 --> 02:41:42.660
<v Speaker 4>You have your money in a bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if the bank fails?</v>

4005
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:44.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this money is banked.</v>

4006
02:41:44.551 --> 02:41:46.080
<v Speaker 4>Your gold is bank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you own it.</v>

4007
02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:50.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not being loaned out to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in a storage facility with your</v>

4008
02:41:50.131 --> 02:41:52.260
<v Speaker 4>name by breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can spend it.</v>

4009
02:41:52.261 --> 02:41:53.700
<v Speaker 4>When you put your money in a bank</v>
<v Speaker 4>account,</v>

4010
02:41:53.701 --> 02:41:56.880
<v Speaker 4>they loan it out to somebody you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know there's government</v>

4011
02:41:56.881 --> 02:41:57.930
<v Speaker 4>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so what?</v>

4012
02:41:57.931 --> 02:41:59.340
<v Speaker 4>They just have to print a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

4013
02:41:59.590 --> 02:42:03.600
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can bank your gold without having to</v>

4014
02:42:03.690 --> 02:42:06.390
<v Speaker 4>put it into the banking system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no bail ins that you have to</v>

4015
02:42:06.391 --> 02:42:07.920
<v Speaker 4>worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or Bank failures.</v>

4016
02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.500
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to worry about inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter how much money the</v>

4017
02:42:10.501 --> 02:42:12.330
<v Speaker 4>government prints,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not mining any gold.</v>

4018
02:42:12.570 --> 02:42:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Gold is going to maintain its value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to the extent that you don't spend it</v>

4019
02:42:15.901 --> 02:42:18.090
<v Speaker 4>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to gain value between the</v>

4020
02:42:18.091 --> 02:42:22.770
<v Speaker 4>time you deposited or the time you earn</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and the time you go to spend it.</v>

4021
02:42:22.770 --> 02:42:25.890
<v Speaker 4>So it's a great store of value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But thanks to the Internet,</v>

4022
02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:29.160
<v Speaker 4>it is the best medium of exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cause it's so easy now to do it so</v>

4023
02:42:29.310 --> 02:42:30.121
<v Speaker 4>you can get out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4024
02:42:30.121 --> 02:42:32.220
<v Speaker 4>you could promote it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that listen to the podcast.</v>

4025
02:42:32.221 --> 02:42:32.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

4026
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:34.020
<v Speaker 4>there are other people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Peter,</v>

4027
02:42:34.021 --> 02:42:36.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't like bitcoin because you,</v>

4028
02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.430
<v Speaker 4>you're promoting gold money that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4029
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:40.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I thought bitcoin was going to work,</v>

4030
02:42:40.921 --> 02:42:42.570
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have been all over it.</v>

4031
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:43.463
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4032
02:42:43.470 --> 02:42:47.970
<v Speaker 4>I have a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very high principles and standards.</v>

4033
02:42:48.010 --> 02:42:50.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started selling gold long before I had</v>

4034
02:42:50.251 --> 02:42:52.770
<v Speaker 4>a gold company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to tell my brokerage accounts at</v>

4035
02:42:52.771 --> 02:42:54.020
<v Speaker 4>your Pacific capital.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would tell them,</v>

4036
02:42:54.021 --> 02:42:55.680
<v Speaker 4>look by some gold and I would just send</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

4037
02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:57.300
<v Speaker 4>does it go buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't sell it.</v>

4038
02:42:57.301 --> 02:43:00.180
<v Speaker 4>And the money that they use to buy gold</v>
<v Speaker 4>was money I couldn't manage.</v>

4039
02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:02.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd make money managing money for fee or</v>

4040
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:04.890
<v Speaker 4>commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if people took their money and</v>

4041
02:43:04.891 --> 02:43:06.210
<v Speaker 4>bought gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't making any money,</v>

4042
02:43:06.211 --> 02:43:08.490
<v Speaker 4>but I thought they should buy it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the right thing to do.</v>

4043
02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.010
<v Speaker 4>And I got involved with gold money</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>

4044
02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 4>that they were onto something.</v>

4045
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I thought that they were doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

4046
02:43:14.141 --> 02:43:17.380
<v Speaker 2>It's more than just about money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a crusade to take back our</v>

4047
02:43:17.381 --> 02:43:18.810
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think Berlin,</v>

4048
02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:21.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>begins with money taking the power away</v>

4049
02:43:21.671 --> 02:43:24.490
<v Speaker 2>from government is rejecting the source</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that power,</v>

4050
02:43:24.491 --> 02:43:26.800
<v Speaker 2>which is the money they spend to corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy.</v>

4051
02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:28.720
<v Speaker 2>So to the extent that more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4052
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the most important vote.</v>

4053
02:43:30.370 --> 02:43:31.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter who you vote for in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4054
02:43:31.681 --> 02:43:34.390
<v Speaker 2>in an election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote with your feet on the money,</v>

4055
02:43:34.660 --> 02:43:38.740
<v Speaker 2>vote away from the Fiat based system and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote in favor of goal.</v>

4056
02:43:38.830 --> 02:43:39.401
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

4057
02:43:39.401 --> 02:43:41.860
<v Speaker 2>that's the monetary system that our</v>
<v Speaker 2>founders believed in.</v>

4058
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:44.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what was embodied in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

4059
02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:46.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's what worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get to that sweet car that's</v>

4060
02:43:46.751 --> 02:43:48.790
<v Speaker 2>made an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sweet card feel good.</v>

4061
02:43:48.791 --> 02:43:49.481
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

4062
02:43:49.481 --> 02:43:51.520
<v Speaker 2>you can get a plastic card for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4063
02:43:51.521 --> 02:43:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to pay for the gold card.</v>

4064
02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:56.410
<v Speaker 2>But the beauty of it is it's worth its</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight in gold.</v>

4065
02:43:56.530 --> 02:43:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So even though you have to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you own that gold.</v>

4066
02:43:59.050 --> 02:43:59.890
<v Speaker 2>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4067
02:43:59.891 --> 02:44:01.780
<v Speaker 2>because it's actual gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can melt it down.</v>

4068
02:44:01.781 --> 02:44:03.010
<v Speaker 2>It's good to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4069
02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean you need to have one in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have,</v>

4070
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:06.550
<v Speaker 2>people have to understand who you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

4071
02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:08.230
<v Speaker 2>You want to let me hold it one more</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4072
02:44:10.470 --> 02:44:11.620
<v Speaker 2>One a hold of Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4073
02:44:12.110 --> 02:44:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel that there's not that many people</v>

4074
02:44:14.351 --> 02:44:17.630
<v Speaker 2>that have those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but feel that that feels legit.</v>

4075
02:44:17.650 --> 02:44:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it actually better than a black</v>
<v Speaker 2>card?</v>

4076
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.903
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

4077
02:44:21.250 --> 02:44:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Way better than black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what an Asshole,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you throw it into a restaurant that,</v>
