00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It is what it was.</v>

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Just like any other problem that people go back to.</v>

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean at some point it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to</v>

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 2>get upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past,</v>

6
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:18.971
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

7
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge point because people define themselves by the past instead of</v>

9
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>thinking about who they are now instead of they still look back at a mistake</v>

10
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>they made and don't just get past that mistake,</v>

11
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>grow and learn,</v>

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but dwell on it.</v>

13
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it defines them.</v>

14
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst thing I met some guys in band,</v>

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 2>he says is a singers.</v>

16
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I've only met him twice,</v>

17
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:38.991
<v Speaker 2>two different times,</v>

18
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>a years later.</v>

19
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.721
<v Speaker 2>Both Times.</v>

20
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 2>He started telling me about the story,</v>

21
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 2>about what happened to him when he was in this.</v>

22
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Anything in this poor guy is gone on all these years and he's still focused on</v>

23
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 2>the worst situation that he ever had to live through.</v>

24
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's so a attached to it.</v>

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Well some guys get one break up and they're done.</v>

27
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.191
<v Speaker 1>Some guys,</v>

28
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>one breakup in their twenties will tank them for a decade.</v>

29
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys like that that,</v>

30
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:03.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

31
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:03.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I came out here with Sally and you know,</v>

33
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>she fucking fell in love with their trainer and dude,</v>

34
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Sally still on.</v>

35
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>What is that in fucking years ago.</v>

36
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

42
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I was so disappointed I can't trust women anymore.</v>

43
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

47
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>What if he got mugged by one person who'd done trust in people?</v>

48
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>One person was a murderer.</v>

49
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's not trust anybody.</v>

50
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.353
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

52
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I heard about Ted Bundy.</v>

53
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trusting people anymore.</v>

54
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

55
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.951
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

57
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sleeping tonight.</v>

58
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.263
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

59
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

60
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life.</v>

61
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.903
<v Speaker 1>You're going to run into him.</v>

62
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>We all are.</v>

63
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>And you can learn and grow.</v>

64
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>If you survive it,</v>

65
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>pick yourself up yet,</v>

66
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 2>dust the dust off and then you start going and I don't let this stuff,</v>

67
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:46.064
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>well let it beat you down.</v>

69
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in</v>

70
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

71
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Their ability to face hardships.</v>

72
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and</v>

74
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and then one day something goes wrong and I mean that's why spoiled</v>

75
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>kids are so sad.</v>

76
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever.</v>

77
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>A young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to</v>

78
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>keep on rescuing him.</v>

79
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Speaker 1>His Dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them money.</v>

80
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have</v>

81
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>the character themselves to be able to get by in life.</v>

82
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 1>They constantly need someone to help them and bailed them out.</v>

83
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Even as a grown man,</v>

84
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys in their forties it's still need help from their parents.</v>

85
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

86
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

87
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

88
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get it right because somewhere along the line they didn't</v>

89
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>face enough of the university to realize that there's sometimes we just got to</v>

90
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>get up and get shit done.</v>

91
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>There's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push</v>

92
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:44.661
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

93
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Even if you want to stay in the bed,</v>

94
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't do that and you just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy</v>

95
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>keeps rescuing you,</v>

96
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you never developed those tools,</v>

97
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you never developed that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your</v>

98
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

99
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>What's your age limit?</v>

100
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>You would cut a check off at a think I think around 55 whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're a generous man.</v>

102
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it all depends.</v>

103
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on if she goes to yoga.</v>

104
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.070
