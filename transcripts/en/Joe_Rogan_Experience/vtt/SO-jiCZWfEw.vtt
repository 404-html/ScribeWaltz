<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>it feels good because it's,</v>

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.153
<v Speaker 1>cabinets.</v>

38
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I think as a competitor you,</v>

39
00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you live for these moments.</v>

40
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>She lived,</v>

41
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you live for these fulfillments,</v>

42
00:00:59.131 --> 00:00:59.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I think somebody like,</v>

44
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>and then I told people since the beginning,</v>

45
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't so much,</v>

46
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.391
<v Speaker 1>the UFC belt,</v>

48
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but it was because it was,</v>

49
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I made it about Demetrius and it was about Demetrius.</v>

50
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>cause he's mean,</v>

52
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>he is widely considered to be the best pound for pound fighter ever.</v>

53
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And you're the first guy,</v>

54
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>not only to beat him but the first guy who,</v>

55
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>not just to beat him but me beat him in like 11 years,</v>

56
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but the first guy to win an Olympic gold medal in wrestling and a UFC</v>

57
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:26.904
<v Speaker 1>championship.</v>

58
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are two gigantic accomplishments.</v>

59
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

61
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:31.141
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

62
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:31.974
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>

63
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>ah God,</v>

64
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

65
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.721
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

66
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I beat the greatest of,</v>

67
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>to me the greatest of all time.</v>

68
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that I be,</v>

69
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.813
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

71
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I can make the run for,</v>

72
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:40.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>who's the greatest combat athlete of all time?</v>

74
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>

75
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm a two sport world champion.</v>

76
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:46.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

77
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

78
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're absolutely in the running now.</v>

79
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

80
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>if he's not the greatest of all time,</v>

81
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I think he is,</v>

82
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 1>but the argument is that he didn't face people as good as John Jones faced and</v>

83
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>then fade or is the other fade or an Anderson silver or the other people that</v>

84
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>are in consideration for the greatest of all time.</v>

85
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

86
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

87
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>it's just a subjective argument.</v>

88
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:07.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

89
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:07.951
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

90
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>who knows who's right,</v>

91
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>but obviously you beat without a doubt one of the best ever.</v>

92
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And like I would,</v>

95
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I would tell people there's,</v>

96
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of a of admiration that I had for Demetrius Johnson.</v>

97
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.511
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>

98
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:22.344
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.633
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

100
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.211
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

101
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:24.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting the dude that's,</v>

103
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

104
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>that almost seems untouchable that you,</v>

105
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>a guy that makes you question yourself.</v>

106
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

107
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

108
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.613
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

109
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.813
<v Speaker 1>this is this,</v>

110
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>this guy's that good.</v>

111
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy is you beat him after he had stopped you.</v>

113
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Just how,</v>

114
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>how long was it?</v>

115
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:39.414
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>

116
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

117
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>but close to about two and a half years ago now.</v>

118
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>About,</v>

120
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

121
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I think two years and like four months.</v>

122
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

123
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>that's an amazing turnaround between getting stopped in the first round and then</v>

124
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>coming back and beating him and beating him in the championship rounds is really</v>

125
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>where you pulled it off.</v>

126
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

127
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

128
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:57.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

129
00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:58.704
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

130
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

131
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.741
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

132
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

133
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>had studied Demetrius Johnson like I seen as a lost son the first time would,</v>

134
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I pretty much did is I got,</v>

135
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I got rid of a lot of people,</v>

136
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 2>including my,</v>

137
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 2>my MMA had coach.</v>

138
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

139
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>my whole philosophy was,</v>

140
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 2>if I can't be the best and there's something wrong,</v>

141
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 2>emotionally,</v>

143
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:17.021
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>

144
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 2>everything else just invested.</v>

145
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.691
<v Speaker 2>And when I lost,</v>

146
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.081
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

147
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.340
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for a better leader,</v>

151
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.551
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

152
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

153
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of what I did.</v>

154
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:26.741
<v Speaker 2>I ended up,</v>

155
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 2>letting go a lot of my cornerman can,</v>

157
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I started traveling the world.</v>

158
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>W went out to Singapore,</v>

159
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>we're now to Wa to Thailand.</v>

160
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:34.991
<v Speaker 2>Went out to,</v>

161
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>to the Netherlands,</v>

163
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>spend months and months at a time out in Brazil.</v>

164
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.141
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

165
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:41.351
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

166
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I was on a quest that was like the,</v>

167
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I kind of remind myself,</v>

168
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.101
<v Speaker 2>literally like,</v>

169
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>ash catch him from Pokemon.</v>

170
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.141
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

171
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I was just on a venture dude,</v>

172
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea who that is.</v>

173
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 3>The vision called vision quest.</v>

174
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:57.451
<v Speaker 3>It was Matthew Modine mood swing swing has to watch that movie</v>

175
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.011
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

176
00:03:59.011 --> 00:03:59.121
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

177
00:03:59.121 --> 00:03:59.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

178
00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.521
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

179
00:03:59.521 --> 00:03:59.711
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

180
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and it'd be,</v>

181
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.931
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

182
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 2>it became an obsession.</v>

183
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:01.961
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

184
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I knew that if anybody could do it,</v>

185
00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:03.781
<v Speaker 2>it'd be,</v>

186
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:04.710
<v Speaker 2>it'd be Hennish the Hudl,</v>

187
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:05.371
<v Speaker 2>like I really did.</v>

188
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And you even after the first time,</v>

189
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Jill,</v>

190
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 2>when he beat me,</v>

191
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>

192
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.091
<v Speaker 2>when they asked me,</v>

193
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:11.311
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

194
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:12.144
<v Speaker 2>Henry,</v>

195
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.730
<v Speaker 2>like I would,</v>

197
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.563
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

198
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.941
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

199
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:15.391
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

200
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.210
<v Speaker 2>but I still know that I could beat him even being knocked out like two minutes</v>

201
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 2>and 36 seconds.</v>

202
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I still knew in my heart.</v>

203
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.281
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

204
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:21.871
<v Speaker 2>UFC one,</v>

205
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I sat there press conferences.</v>

206
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm still the one that beat him.</v>

207
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 2>What was it about</v>

208
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 3>him that made you think that you could beat him?</v>

209
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.550
<v Speaker 3>What was it about you specifically in relation to him and his skill set?</v>

210
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

211
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.723
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

212
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

213
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 3>if you're asking me what the difference,</v>

214
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.550
<v Speaker 3>what was it that made you think even after he stopped you in the first round?</v>

215
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.403
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

216
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.343
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

217
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it was more so just believing in my,</v>

218
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.090
<v Speaker 2>in my abilities.</v>

219
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I think me just believe in Mora.</v>

220
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.981
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

221
00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:52.251
<v Speaker 2>Henry,</v>

222
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.084
<v Speaker 2>you need time.</v>

223
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I was only doing MMA for three years when I fought him the first time.</v>

224
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't know that year's you see you fighting for the title.</v>

226
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:00.611
<v Speaker 3>Not once,</v>

227
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:01.444
<v Speaker 3>but twice.</v>

228
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 3>The price probably been doing MMA for a long ass time.</v>

229
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 3>But when you find them for the first time,</v>

230
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.611
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

231
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a very short amount of time to be finding an MMA.</v>

232
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 3>It's especially again to caliber athletic.</v>

233
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Demetrius,</v>

234
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 3>what year did you win the Olympics and,</v>

235
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.204
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>

236
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.541
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

237
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.420
<v Speaker 3>see that is,</v>

238
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you're doing that,</v>

239
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you're 100% dedicated to wrestling.</v>

240
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.021
<v Speaker 3>You have to be,</v>

241
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

242
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>So were you doing any striking training at all back then?</v>

243
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

244
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.161
<v Speaker 2>did I did,</v>

245
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>what happened was once I won the Olympics,</v>

246
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.343
<v Speaker 2>almost kind of,</v>

247
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I fell out of love with the sport.</v>

248
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I fell,</v>

249
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I fell out of love with Russ.</v>

250
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 2>And I remember being at the Olympics and being like,</v>

251
00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:39.201
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

252
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

253
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I have it in me no more just cause you're burnt out.</v>

254
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.741
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

255
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:43.574
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

256
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.860
<v Speaker 2>my whole childhood was gone because of the sport.</v>

257
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Take that crazy mask off.</v>

258
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Part of that.</v>

259
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.583
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

260
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been waiting for you to say that.</v>

261
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 3>We'll do it in stages.</v>

262
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.450
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

263
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

264
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you fell out of love with it.</v>

265
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I fell out of love with it.</v>

266
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Which is,</v>

267
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.771
<v Speaker 4>which is it?</v>

268
00:06:04.771 --> 00:06:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Just because your whole life had been dedicated to wrestling and you'd finally</v>

269
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:10.350
<v Speaker 4>achieved the greatest of great goals.</v>

270
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

271
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Olympic gold medalist is the top of the mountain.</v>

272
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.041
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

273
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 2>but check this out Joe.</v>

274
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>And it was like in the year of 2007,</v>

275
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

276
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.041
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

277
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I went through the worst year ever.</v>

278
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.781
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

279
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I was ready to become a world champion and I went out to the world champions in</v>

280
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 2>2007 and I didn't even score a point.</v>

281
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I can the first round,</v>

282
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 2>like I got put out by Bite Juran and a for somebody in that whole year,</v>

283
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:33.201
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

284
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I was just going through freaking struggles like left and right.</v>

285
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about just that versus I couldn't want to turn him in to save my</v>

286
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

287
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.613
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

288
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

289
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

290
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

291
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I truly,</v>

292
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.301
<v Speaker 2>truly don't know.</v>

293
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:44.991
<v Speaker 2>I think I was,</v>

294
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

295
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I probably begin kind of fallen out of love with it.</v>

296
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And I remember there was,</v>

297
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:50.691
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

298
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>there was only two tournaments that everyone has to win and that was,</v>

299
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 2>that was the Olympic trials and eventually the Olympic Games and,</v>

300
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.071
<v Speaker 2>and somehow like,</v>

301
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm correlating this with the,</v>

302
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 2>with the fight with Demetrius Johnson and uh,</v>

303
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

304
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

306
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 2>just almost being in tears.</v>

307
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I just don't know if this is for me and the,</v>

308
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 2>but I just stuck with it.</v>

309
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:11.984
<v Speaker 2>I stuck with it.</v>

310
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I ended up putting the Olympic trials.</v>

311
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I ended up going to the,</v>

312
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:14.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

313
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>the Olympic Games and I ended up pretty much fallen behind in every single</v>

314
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:18.700
<v Speaker 2>match,</v>

315
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

316
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 2>that I was wrestling.</v>

317
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

318
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 2>these are kind of the adversities that I was going through,</v>

319
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>like leading up to become an Olympic champion.</v>

320
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.641
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

321
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting when you were fighting,</v>

322
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

323
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Demetrius for the second time,</v>

324
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.253
<v Speaker 4>Daniel Cormier,</v>

325
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 4>some said something very interesting.</v>

326
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.073
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

327
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 4>most guys,</v>

328
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.851
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

329
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I would never give a chance.</v>

330
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

331
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 4>you get stopped by Dj.</v>

332
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 4>And then a couple of years later you're fighting him again.</v>

333
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.541
<v Speaker 4>Like he's,</v>

334
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 4>he's going to have your number,</v>

335
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be better in the rematch.</v>

336
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:45.831
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

337
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.311
<v Speaker 4>but Henry,</v>

338
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:46.871
<v Speaker 4>so who knows,</v>

339
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 4>a different kind of athlete.</v>

340
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

341
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.290
<v Speaker 4>and he talked about you competing and then coming back a year later and,</v>

342
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 4>and being,</v>

343
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.341
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

344
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 4>he was many times better.</v>

345
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.411
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

346
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:57.531
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

347
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 4>the amount of improvement that he got in just one year was just unbelievable.</v>

348
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.561
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

350
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I guess she could know that teaching netics I think you could talk a lot about</v>

352
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>desire to just having the sex only get you so far.</v>

353
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.020
<v Speaker 2>The Olympics has,</v>

354
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 2>has g great genetics for sure.</v>

355
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:16.131
<v Speaker 2>But it's almost,</v>

356
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 2>it almost becomes a,</v>

357
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.013
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

358
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.861
<v Speaker 2>a mentality.</v>

359
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm because of a philosophy.</v>

360
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like you almost start doing things almost like two to not feel that,</v>

361
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 2>to not to not feel the pain of losing.</v>

362
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

363
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a motivator to not feel the pain of losing.</v>

364
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.100
<v Speaker 2>And I remember when Demetrius Johnson hit me,</v>

365
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>hit me and hit me in the leg and I literally,</v>

366
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you put your,</v>

367
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.151
<v Speaker 2>how severe it was.</v>

368
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I literally spraying like a,</v>

369
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>a severe low ankle sprain in those first 30 seconds in the second fight.</v>

370
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 2>So I fought Demetrius Johnson like that.</v>

371
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:47.961
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

372
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:48.321
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

373
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 2>to me the motivator was like,</v>

374
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:49.701
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

375
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to feel that pain of losing more.</v>

376
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.301
<v Speaker 2>I hate it man.</v>

377
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I hate feeling second place.</v>

378
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I hate feeling Kinda,</v>

379
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.620
<v Speaker 2>kinda somewhat.</v>

380
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.560
<v Speaker 2>He's looking over me.</v>

381
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Someone's a almost like a manhood cha and I hate that.</v>

382
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Was it a low leg kick that been made your,</v>

383
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.761
<v Speaker 2>your ankle go?</v>

384
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Like what was it?</v>

385
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.201
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

386
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a nerve that you have behind La,</v>

387
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.960
<v Speaker 2>like the bonus up PR,</v>

388
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the brand peripheral peripheral nerve p.</v>

389
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>

390
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 2>R.</v>

391
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

392
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>And I got hit there so I put my foot to sleep just like when Michael Chandler,</v>

393
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.460
<v Speaker 2>it happened to him in Beltour.</v>

394
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.403
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

395
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.031
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

396
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Stepping on it and it's just not working.</v>

397
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And the pro and the reason,</v>

398
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 2>these reasons why everybody kind of got scared.</v>

399
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause I was,</v>

400
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I was hurt,</v>

401
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>but I remember before the fight,</v>

402
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

403
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I remember I saw my cornerman like kind of wait for,</v>

404
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I fought the meters.</v>

405
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember I saw him all.</v>

406
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:38.894
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

407
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I saw him on nervous and never see,</v>

408
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I remember grabbing my cornerman is putting them right in front of me.</v>

409
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:45.191
<v Speaker 2>I remember telling him,</v>

410
00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

411
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.173
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

412
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I've been here before.</v>

413
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I was ranked 31st in the world.</v>

414
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:50.131
<v Speaker 2>I'd be,</v>

415
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

416
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

417
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I became a world champion in wrestling.</v>

418
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:53.881
<v Speaker 2>Like guys,</v>

419
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:54.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

420
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

421
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 2>I want you guys to have a little faith in the deed,</v>

422
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to ask you guys one thing and I'm going to ask you guys,</v>

423
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask you guys to be composed.</v>

424
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.581
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

425
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 2>the key to winning this fight is for me to be composed.</v>

426
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 2>And then pretty much there's six hours later,</v>

427
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

428
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

429
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:09.991
<v Speaker 2>right before,</v>

430
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:10.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 2>walk on the start playing my song.</v>

432
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I looked back at my corner and I said,</v>

433
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:14.844
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

434
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.361
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

435
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:16.194
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

436
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:16.591
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

437
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>the key to this fight,</v>

438
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 2>remember I said it'd be composure.</v>

439
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So when Denesha Johnson kicked me,</v>

440
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

441
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe in my own philosophy,</v>

442
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:24.301
<v Speaker 2>I went back to,</v>

443
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

444
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 2>my composure because I was hurt.</v>

445
00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Y'All.</v>

446
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Like he could have stopped me that,</v>

447
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 2>that first round I was forced to switch south South Paul,</v>

448
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 2>which had never fight in South Pole,</v>

449
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:33.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

450
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:34.734
<v Speaker 2>so now we're kind of,</v>

451
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I worked with me and Demetrius Johnson or playing poker,</v>

452
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.220
<v Speaker 2>my whole philosophy and the key to this victory was a composure part.</v>

453
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:42.631
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

454
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

455
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.643
<v Speaker 2>when he hit me,</v>

456
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.431
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

457
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

458
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I really did.</v>

459
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.141
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

460
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

461
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 2>not again did not again,</v>

462
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to last two minutes and 36 seconds.</v>

463
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:51.624
<v Speaker 2>Not Again,</v>

464
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.561
<v Speaker 2>but it again,</v>

465
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 2>the motivator was not to feel the pain to lose again.</v>

466
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't a desire to win.</v>

467
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.601
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

468
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to feel that pain anymore as a competitor,</v>

469
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.733
<v Speaker 2>as somebody that,</v>

470
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.221
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

471
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 2>that that's on a mission to that sacrifices life.</v>

472
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Explain to someone who's never experienced that before.</v>

473
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>What is that pain like?</v>

474
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.890
<v Speaker 2>You train for how many weeks and then you find mighty mouse with the title.</v>

475
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 2>You get stopped in the first round.</v>

476
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.480
<v Speaker 2>What does our pain La man,</v>

477
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

478
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I think every fighter has a spirit.</v>

479
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the spirit?</v>

480
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:22.530
<v Speaker 2>The spirit is your spirit.</v>

481
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:23.251
<v Speaker 2>Is your dream.</v>

482
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.220
<v Speaker 2>This bird is that,</v>

483
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.991
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

484
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you've watched somebody become a world champion.</v>

485
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:27.661
<v Speaker 2>You want to be,</v>

486
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:27.781
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

487
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to be just like that guy.</v>

488
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.421
<v Speaker 2>Your confidence,</v>

489
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 2>your self esteem.</v>

490
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

491
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 2>that's your spirit and you will also,</v>

492
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 2>we also have a spirit of a war that's like the,</v>

493
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 2>the man has side of it.</v>

494
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when I got stopped with Demetrius Johnson to,</v>

495
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:41.101
<v Speaker 2>I almost felt like,</v>

496
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 2>and I've never gone through this,</v>

497
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:45.260
<v Speaker 2>not even in wrestling my life like ours,</v>

498
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 2>like my spirit was shot and I had to kind of pick up my pieces to kind of start</v>

499
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.701
<v Speaker 2>healing myself.</v>

500
00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Like mentally and I feel like it,</v>

501
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:53.780
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

502
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>if</v>

503
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 3>you look at a Joe with somebody like Roy Jones jr he got knocked out one time</v>

504
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 3>and it became a domino effect.</v>

505
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

506
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Because he never,</v>

507
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 3>he never picked off those pieces.</v>

508
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 3>He never started healing that spirit.</v>

509
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

510
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.300
<v Speaker 3>he got knocked down again real bad right afterwards by Glen Johnson to members.</v>

511
00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:09.900
<v Speaker 3>There's two,</v>

512
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 3>two knockouts in a row.</v>

513
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Tarver Tarver k Odom and then [inaudible].</v>

514
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.743
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>

515
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of factors involved in that loss because I think Roy was also</v>

516
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 3>coming off of the John Ruiz fight where he gained a lot of weight to get up to</v>

517
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:25.031
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight,</v>

518
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 3>and then he had to lose that weight to get down the light heavyweight again.</v>

519
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.150
<v Speaker 3>So he was lean at heavyweight and then all of a sudden he's dropping down to 175</v>

520
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:34.444
<v Speaker 3>pounds again.</v>

521
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 3>And he just looked like,</v>

522
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

523
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 3>it looks smooth.</v>

524
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It looked like his body was all sucked in and I just think it was a bad,</v>

525
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:43.150
<v Speaker 3>bad weight cut.</v>

526
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.910
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

527
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 3>I think whatever he took to get himself up to 200 pounds to it was probably out</v>

528
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.234
<v Speaker 3>of its system.</v>

529
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 3>And now his body was,</v>

530
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:51.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

531
00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 3>his hormones were probably all fucked up.</v>

532
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 3>He just wasn't the same guy.</v>

533
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:54.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

534
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:55.001
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

535
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:55.601
<v Speaker 3>let's be real,</v>

536
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

537
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 3>The weekends,</v>

538
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 3>it's important.</v>

539
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't just grow the 200 pounds without some Mexican supplements.</v>

540
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.663
<v Speaker 3>This like,</v>

541
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.481
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

542
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

543
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.780
<v Speaker 3>it'll take a long fucking time for 168 pound fighter to get up to 200 pounds.</v>

544
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time.</v>

545
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 3>If you want to really get up to 200 pounds,</v>

546
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.681
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

547
00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 3>an actual 200 pound body,</v>

548
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.710
<v Speaker 3>not just like fill yourself up with water and fat.</v>

549
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.101
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

550
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Did to actually be 200 pounds of way he was,</v>

551
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.680
<v Speaker 3>your body's got to,</v>

552
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.511
<v Speaker 3>your body's got to say,</v>

553
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:25.901
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

554
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 3>we need to fucking grow.</v>

555
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 3>We got resources that need to be allocated towards muscle.</v>

556
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 3>We've got to,</v>

557
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 3>we've got to gain all this weight because w we're lifting weights all the time.</v>

558
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.341
<v Speaker 3>We're doing things.</v>

559
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 3>You have to do something to get your body that heavy so that and then all of a</v>

560
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:41.170
<v Speaker 3>sudden it shut that shit off and say,</v>

561
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.080
<v Speaker 3>right now we're getting down to one 75 and you've got to do it in a few months.</v>

562
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I think his body was just wrecked.</v>

563
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

564
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Boxes don't always cut weight the right way either.</v>

565
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Neither do I may fighters.</v>

566
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

567
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 3>particularly back in the day there's,</v>

568
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting about the approach that you guys took to this camp</v>

569
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 3>that you wanted to talk about,</v>

570
00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:58.781
<v Speaker 3>which is a very,</v>

571
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.420
<v Speaker 3>very scientific approach towards your recovery towards training methods.</v>

572
00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:03.254
<v Speaker 3>So it's everything.</v>

573
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

574
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.370
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

575
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 3>you really had it dialed in as opposed to just trying to wing it,</v>

576
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 3>which for many,</v>

577
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 3>many years was how almost every fight or did it.</v>

578
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

579
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.180
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's a how,</v>

580
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.271
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

581
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.091
<v Speaker 3>we got a video.</v>

582
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

583
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.471
<v Speaker 3>I found that part.</v>

584
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:18.560
<v Speaker 3>We got kicked and you can see like,</v>

585
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:18.800
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

586
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.633
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

587
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.103
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

588
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.160
<v Speaker 3>it was right there.</v>

589
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Just the back of the leg like that.</v>

590
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>

591
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Just one shin to the mat.</v>

592
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I still fly.</v>

593
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm still flopping.</v>

594
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

595
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going back to that philosophy.</v>

596
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:36.221
<v Speaker 3>Composure.</v>

597
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:36.461
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

598
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm still flopping,</v>

599
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't seem like he understands what's happened to you yet.</v>

600
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

601
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:40.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

602
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:40.971
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

603
00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:41.250
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

604
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 3>you played poker so well.</v>

605
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

606
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting.</v>

607
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

608
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:46.541
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

609
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:47.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm still,</v>

610
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

611
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.200
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

612
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 3>As soon as that happened,</v>

613
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 3>I did remember the Michael Chandler fight and I remember he went on a show and</v>

614
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 3>said exactly what happened.</v>

615
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 3>So I told uh,</v>

616
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.850
<v Speaker 3>our other corners Santina the frank and when we get in,</v>

617
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 3>put ice on his knee,</v>

618
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 3>not his ankle because it was the where it happened.</v>

619
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 3>Cause I watched that show and I remember watching it for that reason,</v>

620
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 3>to wonder why,</v>

621
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.513
<v Speaker 3>what happened to them.</v>

622
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy when you watch it because it's just the foot hit the back of your</v>

623
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:15.284
<v Speaker 3>knee.</v>

624
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

625
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.260
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

626
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

627
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.720
<v Speaker 3>you can see it again.</v>

628
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't even the hardest kick in the world.</v>

629
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 3>He kind of caught you at the very end with his foot and immediately that nerve,</v>

630
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.100
<v Speaker 3>just one [inaudible] right here.</v>

631
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.460

<v Speaker 3>a period against a guy like the meat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

718
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 3>So you like seeing them accomplish these fantastic goals and visualizing</v>

719
00:17:14.221 --> 00:17:16.230
<v Speaker 3>yourself experiencing that exact same thing.</v>

00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

724
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't sound corny at all.</v>

725
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Especially not coming from the champ.</v>

726
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:22.871
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

727
00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:23.770
<v Speaker 3>once you're the champ,</v>

728
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.880
<v Speaker 3>all that corny shit's out.</v>

729
00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:26.290
<v Speaker 3>The window works.</v>

730
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.610
<v Speaker 3>People start believing it.</v>

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

734
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.720
<v Speaker 3>They believe the fuck out of it.</v>

735
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Now they're talking about you possibly fighting Tj Dillashaw for the</v>

736
00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:36.670
<v Speaker 3>bantamweight title.</v>

737
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.050

761
00:18:03.261 --> 00:18:05.720

766
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:15.290
<v Speaker 4>a UFC fight I think is at the staple center or maybe Anaheim.</v>

767
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.183
<v Speaker 4>Anaheim,</v>

768
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Anaheim,</v>

769
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Anaheim in the pond.</v>

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

775
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.350
<v Speaker 4>just 20 million motherfuckers in California.</v>

776
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.090
<v Speaker 4>Plenty of people that go around.</v>

777
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

778
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Terms of audience.</v>

779
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

780
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.341
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

781
00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:28.730
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

782
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.851
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

783
00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been talks,</v>

784
00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:30.861
<v Speaker 2>but it's been,</v>

785
00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:31.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

786
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

787
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.251
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

788
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Ali,</v>

789
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.130
<v Speaker 2>my manager has really truly like actually sat down and talk with the UFC,</v>

790
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.761
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

791
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody wants to do it though.</v>

792
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

793
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 4>it's one of two things is going to happen there,</v>

794
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

795
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.411
<v Speaker 4>It's either,</v>

796
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

797
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean now the DJ has gone to one.</v>

798
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

799
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Demetrius Johnson just left the UFC and went over to one FC in a one fc for</v>

800
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 4>people who have no idea what we're talking about is a gigantic organization in</v>

801
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 4>Asia.</v>

802
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 4>They are literally the equivalent to the UFC in Asia.</v>

803
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 4>And although many people in America are not aware of them,</v>

804
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 4>they don't know who they are.</v>

805
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 4>They're a huge organization overseas,</v>

806
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 4>absolutely gigantic.</v>

807
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Speaker 4>And they do a fantastic job.</v>

808
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 4>They have real high level fighters.</v>

809
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

810
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Ben asked her and was their champion.</v>

811
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 4>He was undefeated over there and he had I think at least one fight,</v>

812
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:20.130
<v Speaker 4>maybe two fights left in his contract.</v>

813
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:20.964
<v Speaker 4>I forget how many,</v>

814
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.360
<v Speaker 4>and they made a deal and the deal was they take mighty mouse and we get Ben ass</v>

815
00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:27.300
<v Speaker 4>grin.</v>

816
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.440
<v Speaker 4>And so that's where it's at right now.</v>

817
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I love the deal.</v>

818
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

819
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 4>I love the idea of it.</v>

820
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

821
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.220

00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

826
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 4>he loves the idea of starting new in a new organization.</v>

827
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

828
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 4>they're going to hey,</v>

829
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:43.884
<v Speaker 4>that motherfucker,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

835
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:54.741
<v Speaker 4>And he also likes the mentality that that organization is operated with,</v>

836
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.671
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

837
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

838
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 4>respect for the martial arts.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

841
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 4>what we saw with the Conor McGregor could,</v>

842
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 4>could be a number of Madoff fired,</v>

843
00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 4>all the trash talking and all the,</v>

844
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 4>all the stuff that you're seeing that was becoming more and more prevalent in</v>

845
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:09.504
<v Speaker 4>the UFC.</v>

846

00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean the dude is,</v>

887
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.280
<v Speaker 2>that dude is,</v>

888
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad matchup for anybody,</v>

889
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

890
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

891
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.221
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

892
00:21:08.221 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 4>Ben ask her.</v>

893
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.970
<v Speaker 4>And I mean there's a reason why he's undefeated and he hasn't been hit in</v>

894
00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:12.960
<v Speaker 4>several fights.</v>

895
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Who was detailing one of the last time we got hit,</v>

896
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

897
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I had him on the podcast because I wanted to let people know about them.</v>

898
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:20.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

899
00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:24.090
<v Speaker 4>I've been a big fan of bay fan of Ban aspirins from back when he was a belt or</v>

900
00:21:24.091 --> 00:21:24.924
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>

901
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.310
<v Speaker 4>And if you watch his fights and belt or against chorus cough and yeah,</v>

902
00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.530
<v Speaker 4>and Lima Lima's a beast man.</v>

903
00:21:31.531 --> 00:21:33.330
<v Speaker 4>And he just dominated them.</v>

904
00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:35.520
<v Speaker 4>Just controlling the Lima fucks people up,</v>

905
00:21:35.521 --> 00:21:36.060
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

906
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Lima's a dangerous,</v>

907
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:38.250
<v Speaker 4>dangerous Kat.</v>

908
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.170
<v Speaker 4>And Ben asked grinches whoop,</v>

909
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.471
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

910
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:41.360
<v Speaker 4>you're on your back again.</v>

911
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

912
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

913
00:21:42.091 --> 00:21:43.860
<v Speaker 4>you can't get up and you taking punches,</v>

914
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:44.691
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

915
00:21:44.691 --> 00:21:46.260
<v Speaker 4>And he's a,</v>

916
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a just a different caliber of wrestling.</v>

917
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.580
<v Speaker 4>And I've said it many,</v>

918
00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:51.420
<v Speaker 4>many times and I bet,</v>

919
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you believe it as well.</v>

920
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.900
<v Speaker 4>It's the most important skill for MMA.</v>

921
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.853
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling.</v>

922
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.150
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

923
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.930
<v Speaker 4>it dictates where the fight takes place.</v>

924
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.340
<v Speaker 4>If you want to stand up,</v>

925
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.031
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

926
00:22:00.031 --> 00:22:02.550
<v Speaker 4>the guy can take you down chuck Liddell style.</v>

927
00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:03.990
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to go to the ground,</v>

928
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.240
<v Speaker 4>you're the one who gets to dictate where the fight takes place.</v>

929
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.660
<v Speaker 4>That's if you're the superior wrestler.</v>

930
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

931
00:22:09.181 --> 00:22:11.760
<v Speaker 4>it's the best base for MMA.</v>

932
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:12.683
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that.</v>

933
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.320
<v Speaker 2>And especially a guy like banks,</v>

934
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I think Ben knows that his,</v>

935
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 2>his strikings not that good.</v>

936
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

937
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>So he just relies on this is,</v>

938
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 2>this is what I know I do a better than anybody and I'm going to control this and</v>

939
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.360
<v Speaker 2>you're going to know how I'm going to do it.</v>

940
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:25.751
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

941
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:26.584
<v Speaker 2>So that's what,</v>

942
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.280
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes been asking.</v>

943
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.880
<v Speaker 4>He's so dangerous.</v>

944
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean a real bad fight for him would be someone that can figure out how to keep</v>

945
00:22:34.951 --> 00:22:35.611
<v Speaker 4>it standing.</v>

946
00:22:35.611 --> 00:22:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Like Jay hair on gave him a real tough fight and Bella tour,</v>

947
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 4>cause Jay Hiran is good wrestler and kept the fight standing high school.</v>

948
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.201
<v Speaker 4>I forget what his,</v>

949
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:45.570
<v Speaker 4>what his take on that fight was.</v>

950
00:22:45.571 --> 00:22:47.460
<v Speaker 4>We talked about it on the podcast,</v>

951
00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:50.910
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think he was too happy with his training for that fight.</v>

952
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.440
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

953
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:56.400
<v Speaker 4>someone like Tyron Woodley who's also a very good wrestler who's a very</v>

954
00:22:56.401 --> 00:22:58.890
<v Speaker 4>dangerous striker would be a tough match up for them.</v>

955
00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:01.890
<v Speaker 4>But they're really front close friends and training partners.</v>

956
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:02.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:23:02.461 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Well this is another thing too on the flip side is like a,</v>

958
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Taryn has been wrestling him since for years I think.</v>

959
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.370
<v Speaker 2>So he knows what the Ben Ashkan experiences,</v>

960
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:11.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

961
00:23:11.581 --> 00:23:12.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's scary.</v>

962
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

963
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean people would be lucky to,</v>

964
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

965
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.150
<v Speaker 2>kind of take them down if you really want to give it a no take downs.</v>

966
00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:18.720
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't,</v>

967
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.280
<v Speaker 2>he just wouldn't let people take them down.</v>

968
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.711
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

969
00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Paris was talking about it,</v>

970
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

971
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:22.661
<v Speaker 4>he's saying,</v>

972
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:23.110
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

973
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.520
<v Speaker 4>it was back when Paris was the champ.</v>

974
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.700
<v Speaker 4>He said if I was forced to fight Ben ass and he goes,</v>

975
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 4>it would be a fucking terrible fight from me.</v>

976
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:30.611
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

977
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:33.130
<v Speaker 4>that guy just take me down and beat the shit out of me.</v>

978
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.830
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

979
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 4>that's what he does then was to win a belt.</v>

980
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.400
<v Speaker 4>The 2008 Olympic team would have five belts.</v>

981
00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Henry gets to DC,</v>

982
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.320
<v Speaker 4>has to and and uh,</v>

983
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Ben Asca and we'd have one that's five belt.</v>

984
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

985
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 3>if he came into the UFC and won the belt,</v>

986
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 3>his teammates,</v>

987
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 3>well they are going to open up eventually that 165 pound division,</v>

988
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 3>which is what Ben is shooting for.</v>

989
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Ben would like that division.</v>

990
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

991
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

992
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 3>and if he said that,</v>

993
00:23:59.211 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

994
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 3>he had one 65 and tire and kept the welterweight title,</v>

995
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 3>that would be great for him.</v>

996
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see the UFC doing a five pound weight difference when all the other</v>

997
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 3>weight differences are so huge.</v>

998
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the smart move would be 10 pounds every,</v>

999
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.153
<v Speaker 3>every spot.</v>

1000
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.280
<v Speaker 3>35455560570 five like move 70 to 75 like when the UFC had a light heavyweight</v>

1001
00:24:20.301 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 3>division initially that the division was a 200 pound division.</v>

1002
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 3>When Tito Ortiz first one and I believe it was 200 pound division,</v>

1003
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.960
<v Speaker 3>and then they raise it up to two oh five and I think just in,</v>

1004
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 3>they needed a one 95 too.</v>

1005
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.131
<v Speaker 3>I really believe,</v>

1006
00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 3>and it probably a two 25 you know,</v>

1007
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:36.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that would,</v>

1008
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 3>that would round it all out,</v>

1009
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 3>which probably will all happen eventually.</v>

1010
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:24:42.251 --> 00:24:42.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:24:42.491 --> 00:24:42.771
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1013
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting to see how that,</v>

1014
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.170
<v Speaker 3>how that unfolds.</v>

1015
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:45.861
<v Speaker 3>But as of now,</v>

1016
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 3>it's man Ashkin,</v>

1017
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 3>she's a beast.</v>

1018
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.120
<v Speaker 3>She's going to be fighting for the belt.</v>

1019
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Pretty silly.</v>

1020
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1021
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:52.990
<v Speaker 3>he's calling out Darren till he wants to fight Darren,</v>

1022
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:54.950
<v Speaker 3>which I love.</v>

1023
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.993
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

1024
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:56.570
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

1025
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 3>that is a classic striker versus grappler match up,</v>

1026
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.400
<v Speaker 3>especially after tiring.</v>

1027
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Just smashed him.</v>

1028
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:03.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1029
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Tyron and the hype train for Darren till we,</v>

1030
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.610
<v Speaker 3>we learned a lot about Darren.</v>

1031
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Darren is a sensational striker,</v>

1032
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.071
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1033
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous striker,</v>

1034
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 3>but keeps his hands low,</v>

1035
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 3>keeps his chin up high.</v>

1036
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1037
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Tyron has proved himself to be really dangerous even against elite strikers.</v>

1038
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:21.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1039
00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>you look at the Wonderboy fights,</v>

1040
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I've said this time and time again,</v>

1041
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you look at those two fights.</v>

1042
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Wonderboy is known as being one of the best strikers to ever compete in the UFC.</v>

1043
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 3>He's got a crate,</v>

1044
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 57 and o was a kickbox or something fucking spectacular like</v>

1045
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1046
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Amazing striking skills.</v>

1047
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.780
<v Speaker 3>But yet Tyron hurt him in both fights,</v>

1048
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.531
<v Speaker 3>both fights.</v>

1049
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Tyron was the one who landed big shots and had Wonderboy badly hurt.</v>

1050
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at the same thing with Darren till Darren tills known as being</v>

1051
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:49.250
<v Speaker 3>this unbelievable striker.</v>

1052
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Tyron clips him,</v>

1053
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 3>drops him,</v>

1054
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 3>and then strangles him.</v>

1055
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1056
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:55.471
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1057
00:25:55.471 --> 00:25:55.630
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1058
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.821
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1059
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 2>it all changes with MMA.</v>

1060
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:59.990
<v Speaker 2>These guys can beat these guys can be the best,</v>

1061
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.340
<v Speaker 2>even the best wrestlers.</v>

1062
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:02.174
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes it,</v>

1063
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.880
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't translate to those sport.</v>

1064
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Like it takes a special somebody to adapt to the sport of MMA,</v>

1065
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.960
<v Speaker 2>not just a rustler.</v>

1066
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1067
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think Tyron has has adapted to his time,</v>

1068
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 2>to his right hand.</v>

1069
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:13.791
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1070
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1072
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're able to take out two strikers,</v>

1073
00:26:16.051 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 2>you like that about you're the real deal.</v>

1074
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.330
<v Speaker 2>He's on your unquestionably the real deal deal.</v>

1075
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinating to see whether or not Norma Medoff and um,</v>

1076
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 3>then grin go at it.</v>

1077
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:28.803
<v Speaker 3>Got To me,</v>

1078
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I had a fight that I really,</v>

1079
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 3>why did you sign in Floyd Mayweather for stop all that nonsense.</v>

1080
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1081
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.260
<v Speaker 3>this is just what we were talking about is not going to happen.</v>

1082
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.190
<v Speaker 3>He has the same age.</v>

1083
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

1085
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.143
<v Speaker 3>that ain't going to happen,</v>

1086
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 3>but it could be as much more of a grab where the needs are.</v>

1087
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Then he is a striker.</v>

1088
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean Connor is a striker that that's sort of made sense.</v>

1089
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 2>If you want to talk about levels.</v>

1090
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I think a Benz,</v>

1091
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I think Ben said barbecue</v>

1092
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:56.140
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1093
00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 3>The better grappler wound.</v>

1094
00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.433
<v Speaker 3>The fuck knows.</v>

1095
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.760
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to see.</v>

1096
00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:01.271
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1097
00:27:01.271 --> 00:27:01.991
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that.</v>

1098
00:27:01.991 --> 00:27:02.440
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

1099
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.280
<v Speaker 2>there's Lavalle was like,</v>

1100
00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:05.140
<v Speaker 2>even though like they don't give black belts in Ruskin.</v>

1101
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:05.470
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1102
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.830
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1103
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:06.920
<v Speaker 2>there's lab was too,</v>

1104
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.780
<v Speaker 2>and I think I've been asking,</v>

1105
00:27:08.781 --> 00:27:10.520
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the greatest folks.</v>

1106
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Dot Writers of all time.</v>

1107
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how dangerous he is.</v>

1108
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:14.883
<v Speaker 2>He's putting the best,</v>

1109
00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.040
<v Speaker 2>the best kids in the world and pretzels and submissions,</v>

1110
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.030
<v Speaker 2>they just wouldn't get out of,</v>

1111
00:27:19.031 --> 00:27:20.090
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

1112
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.550
<v Speaker 2>he's like a bowl constricted.</v>

1113
00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Well he's,</v>

1114
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.530
<v Speaker 2>he's</v>

1115
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.730
<v Speaker 3>dunning in his ability to control guys.</v>

1116
00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:25.211
<v Speaker 3>Like you're like,</v>

1117
00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:26.440
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man?</v>

1118
00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Like chorus golf,</v>

1119
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1120
00:27:28.361 --> 00:27:31.940
<v Speaker 3>and Lima are two great examples cause you look at those guys and Bella tour and</v>

1121
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:33.070
<v Speaker 3>they'd just smash people.</v>

1122
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.480
<v Speaker 3>But to Korskoff has one of the craziest spinning back kick knockouts I've ever</v>

1123
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:38.314
<v Speaker 3>seen in my life.</v>

1124
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.840
<v Speaker 3>He sent this dude flying through the air.</v>

1125
00:27:40.841 --> 00:27:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that?</v>

1126
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.990
<v Speaker 3>A couple of fights ago and the Grand Prix</v>

1127
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.170
<v Speaker 3>fucking nasty.</v>

1128
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.770
<v Speaker 3>He hits this dude is spinning back kick and literally like launches them into</v>

1129
00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:53.740
<v Speaker 3>space and then smashes him when he goes down to the ground.</v>

1130
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look at what lean has been able to do to people when the Roy</v>

1131
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.390
<v Speaker 3>MacDonald fight was a very close fight.</v>

1132
00:27:58.391 --> 00:27:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Look at this,</v>

1133
00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.673
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>

1134
00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1135
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.293
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1136
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.000
<v Speaker 3>He lost that too.</v>

1137
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that in Boise?</v>

1138
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where that was,</v>

1139
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.090
<v Speaker 3>but so Koresh cough,</v>

1140
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:10.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1141
00:28:10.721 --> 00:28:12.760
<v Speaker 3>if you watched the Korotkoff fight with,</v>

1142
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.400
<v Speaker 3>with Ben Aspirin and it's a mauling,</v>

1143
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:16.241
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1144
00:28:16.241 --> 00:28:16.810
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1145
00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.360
<v Speaker 3>it's just a guy just getting fucked up.</v>

1146
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.250
<v Speaker 3>That's what that fight is.</v>

1147
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

1148
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Ben Asked her and just dominated him,</v>

1149
00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.500
<v Speaker 3>like absolutely dominated them.</v>

1150
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:26.951
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1151
00:28:26.951 --> 00:28:29.260
<v Speaker 3>the dude tried to jump back and landed.</v>

1152
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.860
<v Speaker 3>It landed right as he was in the air out.</v>

1153
00:28:32.861 --> 00:28:33.700
<v Speaker 3>She Wauwatosa.</v>

1154
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:35.110
<v Speaker 2>And No.</v>

1156
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 2>And Ben and this guy never got a punch off of it.</v>

1157
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1158
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.830
<v Speaker 3>it was a total domination.</v>

1159
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Same as the Lima fight.</v>

1160
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Lima crushes people.</v>

1161
00:28:43.501 --> 00:28:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1162
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Liam is one of the scariest strikers.</v>

1163
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:46.381
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1164
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:48.140
<v Speaker 3>and he knocked out Korskoff.</v>

1165
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1166
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Lima smashes people.</v>

1167
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 3>But you see Lima against Ben [inaudible].</v>

1168
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1169
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:55.110
<v Speaker 3>obviously it was a younger Lima.</v>

1170
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's got more experienced now,</v>

1171
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 3>but the difference was so stunning.</v>

1172
00:28:59.280 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

1173
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.443
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

1174
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Saskatoon.</v>

1175
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Lima.</v>

1176
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:02.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1177
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1178
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.013
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1179
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.501
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1180
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 3>It was a two Chinese guys,</v>

1181
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:06.294
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

1182
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.840
<v Speaker 3>This is not an Oscar in Lima.</v>

1183
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.693
<v Speaker 3>You gotta trust me.</v>

1184
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 3>This is not asking leamy either.</v>

1185
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.363
<v Speaker 3>Title.</v>

1186
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure the videos,</v>

1187
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying it was Joe being a bully.</v>

1188
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 3>You got to trust me.</v>

1189
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:22.923
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

1190
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.040
<v Speaker 3>those dudes are not the same guys.</v>

1191
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.611
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1192
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you lose your patience.</v>

1193
00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1194
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.553
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

1195
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>

1196
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean just the way he manhandled him,</v>

1197
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.850
<v Speaker 3>like his wrestling is just,</v>

1198
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 3>you see guys that are used to defending takedowns and then they find on their</v>

1199
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Speaker 3>back and you say,</v>

1200
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit Man.</v>

1201
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I think he did get up kicked here and his nose got broken.</v>

1202
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1203
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 3>he got cracked.</v>

1204
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean he blamed us a fucking monster man.</v>

1205
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 3>And He's a super dangerous striker and he's huge for the weight class.</v>

1206
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.790
<v Speaker 3>You stand next to Lima,</v>

1207
00:29:57.791 --> 00:29:58.451
<v Speaker 3>you like Jesus.</v>

1208
00:29:58.451 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 3>How do you make one 70?</v>

1209
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 3>He's straight.</v>

1210
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't end up in the Jacuzzi at the hotel.</v>

1211
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him.</v>

1212
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1214
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:06.210
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1215
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 3>he's struggling to make that weight.</v>

1216
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.793
<v Speaker 3>He's a big guy.</v>

1217
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.491
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1218
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:11.200
<v Speaker 3>point being Ben Aspirin,</v>

1219
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1220
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 3>at one 70 super,</v>

1221
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 3>super interesting fight.</v>

1222
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.430
<v Speaker 3>I would like to the person that the fight that I would like to see,</v>

1223
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I like to see him and uh,</v>

1224
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 3>him and Colby.</v>

1225
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.551
<v Speaker 3>Colby,</v>

1226
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:22.384
<v Speaker 3>Covington,</v>

1227
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.781
<v Speaker 3>Ben and cobit.</v>

1228
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:24.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:30:24.011 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 3>That would be really interesting.</v>

1230
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I think but isn't Colby next in line for the title?</v>

1232
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think he's got the interim belt.</v>

1233
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.360
<v Speaker 3>If he has the interim bell surprise.</v>

1234
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised it's still the White House</v>

1235
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:38.763
<v Speaker 3>White House.</v>

1236
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.190
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have it anymore and sit in the White House.</v>

1237
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.200
<v Speaker 3>But I mean did they didn't strip him?</v>

1238
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.681
<v Speaker 3>Did they,</v>

1239
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 3>cause there was some talk of stripping him because he was supposed to.</v>

1240
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:48.911
<v Speaker 3>He not that I know of.</v>

1241
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there was ever a strip.</v>

1242
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 3>So I think there,</v>

1243
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I think I tried to market.</v>

1244
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 3>So I think as soon as you get the champ,</v>

1245
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Wikipedia here says he was the interim from June 9th to September 8th.</v>

1246
00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:58.271
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1247
00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.510
<v Speaker 3>So they did strip them also.</v>

1248
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.880
<v Speaker 3>They did show the stripping was because they wanted him to fight on the Darren</v>

1249
00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:04.714
<v Speaker 3>till card.</v>

1250
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.260
<v Speaker 3>When Darren till fought Tyron,</v>

1251
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 3>they wanted him to fight Tyron and apparently he had gone through,</v>

1252
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:12.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1253
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 3>hard training camp.</v>

1254
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 3>He was all busted up.</v>

1255
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:15.400
<v Speaker 3>He needed time to recover.</v>

1256
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.850
<v Speaker 3>So I guess they stripped him that old man.</v>

1257
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Interim titles,</v>

1258
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 3>interim titles are like attached with Velcro.</v>

1259
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.250
<v Speaker 3>They just disappear.</v>

1260
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.660
<v Speaker 3>They get yanked off you.</v>

1261
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

1262
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.043
<v Speaker 3>they're not really,</v>

1263
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.040
<v Speaker 3>they're not really like,</v>

1264
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.770
<v Speaker 3>especially at UCT 29.</v>

1265
00:31:31.771 --> 00:31:32.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean they all had belts,</v>

1266
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 3>stuff Tony Ferguson had about Connor had about,</v>

1267
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1268
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.860
<v Speaker 3>obviously it could be that his bells,</v>

1269
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.020
<v Speaker 3>we had three people walking around.</v>

1270
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.370
<v Speaker 3>I was at the Tony Ferguson one to me is a,</v>

1271
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 3>is a shame.</v>

1272
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a shame that a guy gets injured and then they strip him like that.</v>

1273
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

1274
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.930
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like that one.</v>

1275
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 3>That one bothered me.</v>

1276
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.091
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1277
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I feel like Tony should still have the interim title.</v>

1278
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I really do it.</v>

1279
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.320
<v Speaker 3>But that was like the third time.</v>

1280
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Then fine half had fine.</v>

1281
00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.930
<v Speaker 3>I know it sucks,</v>

1282
00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>but the other one wasn't his fault.</v>

1283
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 3>The other one was Khabib.</v>

1284
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Khabib,</v>

1285
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1286
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 3>It could be was supposed to make the weight and he,</v>

1287
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:04.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1288
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.420
<v Speaker 3>he got to the one medically cold argument</v>

1289
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 3>could be pulled out and how many times Tony pull out.</v>

1290
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.350
<v Speaker 3>So we pulled out once for sure because he was injured.</v>

1291
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:15.240
<v Speaker 3>The last one when the,</v>

1292
00:32:15.241 --> 00:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>his knee blew apart and then Khabib definitely got yanked off the card one.</v>

1293
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.233
<v Speaker 3>It was called the weight.</v>

1294
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.303
<v Speaker 3>The weight cut.</v>

1295
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Remember the weight cut was so bad that his kidneys were failing.</v>

1296
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Either way we've been there.</v>

1298
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:29.863
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

1300
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:30.071
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1301
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:30.904
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

1302
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.160
<v Speaker 3>do you like fighting at 35?</v>

1303
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know you fought it 35 for a while when you were struggling to make</v>

1304
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:40.910
<v Speaker 3>flyweight you ha you had some issues early on in your career when you really</v>

1305
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 3>didn't make the weight very well.</v>

1306
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 5>It was a god I was,</v>

1308
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 5>I was getting older I think in my career.</v>

1309
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 5>I think the reason why I started having a weight problem was because of,</v>

1310
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:52.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1311
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 5>I was just getting older and I was doing some crazy stuff.</v>

1312
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 5>Like I used to code like this microphone up like I used to.</v>

1313
00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.473
<v Speaker 5>I used to,</v>

1314
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.380
<v Speaker 5>I used to to cut a bus 16 pounds,</v>

1315
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 5>like in and a two,</v>

1316
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 5>two hour sessions.</v>

1317
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1318
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:06.951
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1319
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:07.341
<v Speaker 5>As a,</v>

1320
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:07.581
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

1321
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 5>as a flyaway are supposed to be fly away.</v>

1322
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 5>Why are you doing that?</v>

1323
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 5>Because I felt like it because I'm a rustler.</v>

1324
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:14.440
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1325
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1326
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 5>my f my whole philosophy at first when I,</v>

1327
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.350
<v Speaker 5>when I got into MMA,</v>

1328
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1329
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.460
<v Speaker 5>was kinda like I and Russell,</v>

1330
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 5>we would never get the same recovery.</v>

1331
00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:24.120
<v Speaker 5>I know it's stupid,</v>

1332
00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:24.980
<v Speaker 5>as stupid as heck,</v>

1333
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:25.790
<v Speaker 5>but we wouldn't,</v>

1334
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.151
<v Speaker 5>we would,</v>

1335
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:28.400
<v Speaker 5>we would never get the recovery that a fire gets.</v>

1336
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.200
<v Speaker 5>So to,</v>

1337
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.961
<v Speaker 5>to me was like,</v>

1338
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:30.141
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1339
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:30.974
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

1340
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.560
<v Speaker 5>I can stretch this as a,</v>

1341
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.620
<v Speaker 5>as long as I can and,</v>

1342
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:33.841
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1343
00:33:33.841 --> 00:33:35.810
<v Speaker 5>and I can suffer the day of wins,</v>

1344
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.670
<v Speaker 5>but I'm gonna recover within 24,</v>

1345
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:38.031
<v Speaker 5>20,</v>

1346
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 5>28 hours sometimes,</v>

1347
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.401
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1348
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:40.941
<v Speaker 5>So to me,</v>

1349
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 5>I tell was looking at it at a very,</v>

1350
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 5>just that an odd way.</v>

1351
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.090
<v Speaker 5>And then finally sort started catching up to me.</v>

1352
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.470
<v Speaker 3>So you just had confidence in your body's ability to bounce back,</v>

1353
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.070
<v Speaker 3>even though you're putting it through an extraordinary amount of stress in</v>

1354
00:33:54.071 --> 00:33:56.230
<v Speaker 3>losing massive amounts of weight really quickly.</v>

1355
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1356
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.600
<v Speaker 3>You just felt like your body can handle it.</v>

1357
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.443
<v Speaker 3>You're tough.</v>

1358
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.640
<v Speaker 3>You're used to it.</v>

1359
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1360
00:34:01.501 --> 00:34:01.801
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1361
00:34:01.801 --> 00:34:02.634
<v Speaker 5>it was the whole,</v>

1362
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.181
<v Speaker 5>cause you know,</v>

1363
00:34:03.181 --> 00:34:04.920
<v Speaker 5>in wrestling we would make weight like every,</v>

1364
00:34:04.921 --> 00:34:05.754
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1365
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.301
<v Speaker 5>every,</v>

1366
00:34:06.301 --> 00:34:06.841
<v Speaker 5>every week,</v>

1367
00:34:06.841 --> 00:34:08.860
<v Speaker 5>sometimes even Russell so much that we're,</v>

1368
00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.590
<v Speaker 5>we're used to kind of like that whole,</v>

1369
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.420
<v Speaker 5>that whole struggle side of things.</v>

1370
00:34:12.421 --> 00:34:12.691
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1371
00:34:12.691 --> 00:34:12.901
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1372
00:34:12.901 --> 00:34:13.021
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1373
00:34:13.021 --> 00:34:14.250
<v Speaker 5>Russell game would do it again.</v>

1374
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.350
<v Speaker 5>What kind of wake up we were talking about when you were wrestling,</v>

1375
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:17.184
<v Speaker 5>how much were you cutting?</v>

1376
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.173
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1377
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1378
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.970
<v Speaker 5>and that was a lot more discipline then,</v>

1379
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.860
<v Speaker 5>but I was probably doing about 12 pounds,</v>

1380
00:34:22.861 --> 00:34:24.780
<v Speaker 5>but I had no fat like at that,</v>

1381
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.890
<v Speaker 5>at that time I was eating just as healthy and as clean as possible because I</v>

1382
00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:29.800
<v Speaker 5>would make weight</v>

1383
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1384
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1385
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.461
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1386
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:31.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1387
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:33.030
<v Speaker 3>every three weeks I had to tournament,</v>

1388
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:33.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1389
00:34:33.501 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 3>I had George Lockhart on and he was explaining to me that a lot of people think</v>

1390
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.680
<v Speaker 3>that when you cut weight that you know,</v>

1391
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 3>like you're cutting out fat.</v>

1392
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.451
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1393
00:34:41.451 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you're not cutting out fat,</v>

1394
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Speaker 3>you're cutting out water.</v>

1395
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.450
<v Speaker 3>And it actually helps to,</v>

1396
00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 3>to have more muscle because muscles most of your water,</v>

1397
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 3>so you're just draining out your muscles.</v>

1398
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Then replenishing them.</v>

1399
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.541
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1400
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 3>when he was explaining that to me,</v>

1401
00:34:54.651 --> 00:34:54.950
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1402
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:55.071
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1403
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I never really thought about it that way.</v>

1404
00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 3>But like a guy like a Yoel Romero who's a very muscular can actually cut more</v>

1405
00:35:00.981 --> 00:35:01.814
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

1406
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1407
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a pretty muscular guy for a flyweight.</v>

1409
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.540
<v Speaker 3>So you were walking around how many pounds over?</v>

1410
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:09.291
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>

1411
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:09.531
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1412
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 3>I was probably cutting for like maybe 20,</v>

1413
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:12.194
<v Speaker 3>25.</v>

1414
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.011
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1415
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 3>So you're walking around like one 50,</v>

1416
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting down to 25.</v>

1417
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

00:35:18.821 --> 00:35:19.181

1425
00:35:23.561 --> 00:35:24.460
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not always,</v>

1426
00:35:24.461 --> 00:35:26.530
<v Speaker 5>you're not always honest with your diet either.</v>

1427

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:10.531
<v Speaker 5>the right way.</v>

1460
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:12.080
<v Speaker 5>I used the whole scientific crowd,</v>

1461
00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:12.861
<v Speaker 5>the nutrition route.</v>

1462
00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:13.694
<v Speaker 5>It's just a,</v>

1463
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1464
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 5>almost like how Bernard Hopkins kind of as he got older men,</v>

1465
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 5>he kind of changed his whole philosophy,</v>

1466
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 5>started using science more.</v>

1467
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 5>So I think everything now in my life when I get ready for fights is all based on</v>

1468
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 5>a saw based on science.</v>

1469
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.110
<v Speaker 5>How did Bernard changes training?</v>

1470
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.040
<v Speaker 5>Do you know?</v>

1471
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.670
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1472
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1473
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:30.110
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1474
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 5>he just started recovering more.</v>

1475
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.440
<v Speaker 5>I think he started using a lot of those neural stems.</v>

1476
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:35.274
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1477
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.910
<v Speaker 5>a hyperbaric chambers think things of that matter.</v>

1478
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Things are that matter and just more scientific based,</v>

1479
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 5>like just this whole training all like all around.</v>

1480
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.990
<v Speaker 5>And did you incorporate any of those methods?</v>

1481
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:46.501
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

1482
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:47.281
<v Speaker 5>I did actually.</v>

1483
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 5>I ended up,</v>

1484
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1485
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:48.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1486
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 5>connecting with this saw connecting with this company called Neuro for Swan,</v>

1487
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:52.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1488
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:53.910
<v Speaker 5>science space company.</v>

1489
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.110
<v Speaker 5>And I actually wanted to bring them meant to kind of,</v>

1490
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.130
<v Speaker 5>to kind of talk about it.</v>

1491
00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:57.271
<v Speaker 5>She'll,</v>

1492
00:36:57.271 --> 00:36:59.780
<v Speaker 5>because this right here and I just changed my whole philosophy.</v>

1493
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about the whole week because how the whole,</v>

1494
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:02.630
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1495
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.880
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>

1496
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.440
<v Speaker 5>Cause how I struggled tool to how my whole training has changed because of,</v>

1497
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 5>because of,</v>

1498
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.300
<v Speaker 5>because of science.</v>

1499
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 5>A science that's very,</v>

1500
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1501
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 5>that uh,</v>

1502
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 5>science that's very,</v>

1503
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:14.661
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1504
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Speaker 5>I guess complex.</v>

1505
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 5>You could say you got have like the right people,</v>

1506
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:18.811
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1507
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:20.280
<v Speaker 5>like dictating your schedule.</v>

1508
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.190
<v Speaker 5>So when you set up a training camp like this,</v>

1509
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 5>how far in advance do you sit down and work out all the details?</v>

1510
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.580
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like the,</v>

1511
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.800
<v Speaker 5>the morning that we wake up is what we know we're going to do.</v>

1512
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.931
<v Speaker 5>But how it,</v>

1513
00:37:32.931 --> 00:37:35.310
<v Speaker 5>like say if you know you have a fight in July,</v>

1514
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:38.910
<v Speaker 5>when would you start preparing for that and when do you sit down and map</v>

1515
00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 5>everything out?</v>

1516
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 5>Well we tried to map things out maybe about three months in advance.</v>

1517
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.420
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like a preparation and two leading to the camp.</v>

1518
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 5>And that's kind of like the phase that we're on now.</v>

1519
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Like now we're on,</v>

1520
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1521
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:49.741
<v Speaker 5>if I fight,</v>

1522
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 5>if it is at that fight in January,</v>

1523
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like our schedule.</v>

1524
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:53.671
<v Speaker 5>It's like there,</v>

1525
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:54.180
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1526
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:54.600
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1527
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.490
<v Speaker 5>there's a pretest to the big test.</v>

1528
00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:01.550
<v Speaker 5>So tomorrow's November 1st so if you were getting ready for a fight in January,</v>

1529
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.750
<v Speaker 5>you would start ramping up somewhere around now.</v>

1530
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:04.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1531
00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:04.651
<v Speaker 5>But it would,</v>

1532
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:04.981
<v Speaker 5>it would,</v>

1533
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 5>it would it be more of a,</v>

1534
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:06.961
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1535
00:38:06.961 --> 00:38:07.710
<v Speaker 5>it would.</v>

1536
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I think the first,</v>

1537
00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 5>the first month leading up to the next eight weeks would be,</v>

1538
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it would be a technical and tactical,</v>

1539
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:17.050
<v Speaker 5>just working on those particular areas that we're,</v>

1540
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 5>that we believe we're going to be in.</v>

1541
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.190
<v Speaker 5>So you're not doing anything crazy.</v>

1542
00:38:20.191 --> 00:38:21.480
<v Speaker 5>Strength and conditioning wise,</v>

1543
00:38:21.481 --> 00:38:22.920
<v Speaker 5>you're not trying to break your body down.</v>

1544
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1545
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.810
<v Speaker 5>no it could because it's all,</v>

1546
00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 5>it's all a learning phase at that point.</v>

1547
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:26.641
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1548
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 5>working the body gate,</v>

1549
00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 5>preparing the body with a lot of body motion movements and things of that</v>

1550
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 5>matter.</v>

1551
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.100
<v Speaker 5>Kind of just bringing more circulation to certain parts of my body.</v>

1552
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Then it rather than,</v>

1553
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:36.971
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1554
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:39.110
<v Speaker 5>somebody picking up a kettle bell and thrown it and,</v>

1555
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1556
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.940
<v Speaker 5>and crazy things like that.</v>

1557
00:38:40.941 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 5>Like I get it.</v>

1558
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.453
<v Speaker 5>It's all,</v>

1559
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 5>it's all sports specific,</v>

1560
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

1561
00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:45.681
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1562
00:38:45.681 --> 00:38:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Range of emotion.</v>

1563
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.040
<v Speaker 3>So how do you organize this?</v>

1564
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Like kind of what,</v>

1565
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.200
<v Speaker 3>what is the team of people that you use and like who's responsible for what?</v>

1566
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1567
00:38:54.471 --> 00:38:54.661
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

1568
00:38:54.661 --> 00:38:54.771
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

1569
00:38:54.771 --> 00:38:55.311
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1570
00:38:55.311 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I think because you got a whole crew in the back of the mat,</v>

1571
00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.050
<v Speaker 3>the Lipton America's with you,</v>

1572
00:39:00.051 --> 00:39:00.650
<v Speaker 3>but you get,</v>

1573
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.900
<v Speaker 3>you get the rest of the Avengers are all waiting in the waiting room.</v>

1574
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.700
<v Speaker 3>The effort.</v>

1575
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.880
<v Speaker 6>I was gonna say,</v>

1576
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.010
<v Speaker 6>we first found him when,</v>

1577
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:07.160
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1578
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.380
<v Speaker 6>he hurt his hand and he had to rehab it.</v>

1579
00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.573
<v Speaker 6>Let me get this off.</v>

1580
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1581
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 3>see it's going in layers just go in.</v>

1582
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:15.070
<v Speaker 3>And so he had heard his hand before</v>

1583
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:15.350
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

1584
00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.183
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1585
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.880
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1586
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.061
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

1587
00:39:17.061 --> 00:39:21.320
<v Speaker 6>his first fight with Sergio Pettis and I was trying to find any way for him to</v>

1588
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.190
<v Speaker 6>still compete and we found somebody using this machine,</v>

1589
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.810
<v Speaker 6>which led us to actually neuro force one and Kareem and all these guys.</v>

1590
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.410
<v Speaker 6>And we tried to force it for him to get back in time.</v>

1591
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:38.120
<v Speaker 6>And I have video of him just screaming in pain trying to get there.</v>

1592
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.800
<v Speaker 6>And we thought we stayed off it for a couple of weeks and then the day of the</v>

1593
00:39:42.801 --> 00:39:46.310
<v Speaker 6>face off he wanted to cut weight and he said his risk kept slipping out.</v>

1594
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.780
<v Speaker 6>And we had a poem from the five of you wanted to see the doctor.</v>

1595
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.823
<v Speaker 6>Doctor says,</v>

1596
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:50.743
<v Speaker 6>no way.</v>

1597
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.621
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't fight.</v>

1598
00:39:51.621 --> 00:39:53.030
<v Speaker 6>So what was the injury?</v>

1599
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.330
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1600
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:54.801
<v Speaker 6>I think it was,</v>

1601
00:39:54.801 --> 00:39:55.634
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1602
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.330
<v Speaker 6>an ended up being something with sprains ligament.</v>

1603
00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:58.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1604
00:39:58.921 --> 00:40:00.960
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a ad spraying like,</v>

1605
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:01.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1606
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.240
<v Speaker 5>one of my ligaments in my hand.</v>

1607
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:04.860
<v Speaker 5>So there's just,</v>

1608
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.030
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing I could do.</v>

1609
00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:06.511
<v Speaker 5>Like I would,</v>

1610
00:40:06.511 --> 00:40:06.930
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

1611
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.840
<v Speaker 5>I would open the cap bottle for the,</v>

1612
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

1613
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:09.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1614
00:40:09.481 --> 00:40:12.270
<v Speaker 5>to kind of have to brush my teeth and uh,</v>

1615
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.130
<v Speaker 5>when it hurt to that point,</v>

1616
00:40:14.131 --> 00:40:14.521
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>

1617
00:40:14.521 --> 00:40:14.680
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1618
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:14.761
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1619
00:40:14.761 --> 00:40:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't do anything.</v>

1620
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:17.451
<v Speaker 5>So then I that,</v>

1621
00:40:17.451 --> 00:40:17.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1622
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.530
<v Speaker 5>I ended up,</v>

1623
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.140
<v Speaker 5>they ended up,</v>

1624
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.930
<v Speaker 5>Eric here ended up connecting me with,</v>

1625
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:24.600
<v Speaker 5>with neuro force and found out that they had like these certain machines that</v>

1626
00:40:24.601 --> 00:40:25.710
<v Speaker 5>help you heal faster.</v>

1627
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.180
<v Speaker 5>And what did the machines do?</v>

1628
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.280
<v Speaker 6>Accelerated recovery.</v>

1629
00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:33.540
<v Speaker 6>So it was like neuro stem and they have about a thousand programs on it.</v>

1630
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.210
<v Speaker 6>And they're just forced him to,</v>

1631
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.800
<v Speaker 6>to recover a lot faster.</v>

1632
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:42.750
<v Speaker 6>The best example was UFC fighter Panto Xia he was on the ultimate fighter 24</v>

1633
00:40:42.751 --> 00:40:43.470
<v Speaker 6>with us.</v>

1634
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.940
<v Speaker 6>Our number one seed that we picked,</v>

1635
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.280
<v Speaker 6>Alexander Pintos Tosha.</v>

1636
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:51.240
<v Speaker 6>I saw him blow three ligaments out of his elbow and he started crying cause he</v>

1637
00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:53.220
<v Speaker 6>had a fight in eight weeks and iron,</v>

1638
00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:54.090
<v Speaker 6>no Scotland.</v>

1639
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.560
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1640
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1641
00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:58.180
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1642
00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1643
00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.190
<v Speaker 6>don't go home tomorrow.</v>

1644
00:40:59.191 --> 00:41:00.840
<v Speaker 6>He's supposed to be going back home to Brazil.</v>

1645
00:41:00.841 --> 00:41:01.200
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

1646
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:01.370
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1647
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.501
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1648
00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:01.641
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1649
00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:01.771
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:03.420
<v Speaker 6>You gotta try it.</v>

1652
00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:04.680

1653
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 6>two sessions a day for 10 days.</v>

1654
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.800
<v Speaker 6>And he went back and he,</v>

1655
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.903
<v Speaker 6>and he fought,</v>

1656
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.830
<v Speaker 6>he fought that guy and beat him.</v>

1657
00:41:10.831 --> 00:41:14.250
<v Speaker 6>He rear naked choke and they guy Neil Siri and put that guy in retirement.</v>

1658

1736
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 1>So to come back with a cape.</v>

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.500
<v Speaker 1>He's going to come back naked.</v>

1738
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.810
<v Speaker 1>We don't have another microphone though,</v>

1739
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:51.411
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

1740
00:42:51.411 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to have to take your spot because there's not another microphone.</v>

1741
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you think of Captain America?</v>

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 1>we use a fourth microphone.</v>

1744
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.990
<v Speaker 1>We actually have to set it up and it's not up right now.</v>

1745
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you think of Captain America?</v>

1746
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.450
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious at that.</v>

1747
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.400
<v Speaker 1>That we got to them.</v>

1748
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.173
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1749
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.490
<v Speaker 1>you know how you are with uh,</v>

1750
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1751
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.261
<v Speaker 1>with addy.</v>

1752
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.150
<v Speaker 1>That's Kinda how,</v>

1753
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 1>how he a high with them,</v>

1754
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1755
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:16.110
<v Speaker 7>that's it.</v>

1756
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:16.501
<v Speaker 7>It's that,</v>

1757
00:43:16.501 --> 00:43:16.900
<v Speaker 7>is that,</v>

1758
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.141
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1759
00:43:17.141 --> 00:43:18.400
<v Speaker 7>it's that certain relationship.</v>

1760
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.930
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

1761
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:19.590
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

1762
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:20.051
<v Speaker 7>Hey man,</v>

1763
00:43:20.051 --> 00:43:20.680
<v Speaker 7>that helps.</v>

1764
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.370
<v Speaker 7>How are you sir?</v>

1765
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:21.551
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1766
00:43:21.551 --> 00:43:21.851
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>

1767
00:43:21.851 --> 00:43:22.371
<v Speaker 7>How you doing Joe?</v>

1768
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:22.661
<v Speaker 7>Shop.</v>

1769
00:43:22.661 --> 00:43:23.500
<v Speaker 7>Tell everybody who you are.</v>

1770
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:23.850
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1771
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:24.551
<v Speaker 7>I'm Kevin Long.</v>

1772
00:43:24.551 --> 00:43:24.851
<v Speaker 7>Gloria.</v>

1773
00:43:24.851 --> 00:43:28.540
<v Speaker 7>I am the chief science officer for Neuro Force One and then I'm a neuro</v>

1774
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:29.650
<v Speaker 7>physiologist as well.</v>

1775
00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.810
<v Speaker 7>So keep this about like a fist from your face.</v>

1776
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.170
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1777
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.130
<v Speaker 7>So um,</v>

1778
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:38.190
<v Speaker 7>tell us what your role was in camp and what you did to,</v>

1779
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.460
<v Speaker 7>to help him get ready.</v>

1780
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:39.820
<v Speaker 7>Cool.</v>

1781
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.061
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1782
00:43:40.061 --> 00:43:44.110
<v Speaker 7>so a neuro force one is a neuroscience based training company and a medical</v>

1783
00:43:44.111 --> 00:43:46.150
<v Speaker 7>grade diagnostic testing company as well.</v>

1784
00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.680
<v Speaker 7>Where are you guys were at a Scottsdale,</v>

1785
00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:48.250
<v Speaker 7>Arizona.</v>

1786
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.780
<v Speaker 7>So what we really focus on,</v>

1787
00:43:49.781 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 7>which a lot of companies aren't talking about is the role of the gut and the</v>

1788
00:43:52.511 --> 00:43:54.640
<v Speaker 7>mind in conjunction with your physical training.</v>

1789
00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.970
<v Speaker 7>So essentially what we do is we start off with a really comprehensive baseline</v>

1790
00:43:57.971 --> 00:43:58.750
<v Speaker 7>assessment.</v>

1791
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.980
<v Speaker 7>We want to run them through everything.</v>

1792
00:43:59.981 --> 00:44:03.180
<v Speaker 7>So the traditional functional threshold powers,</v>

1793
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.630
<v Speaker 7>autonomic nervous system,</v>

1794
00:44:04.631 --> 00:44:05.860
<v Speaker 7>DC brain potentials.</v>

1795
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 7>And really what you want to do is you want to put somebody on a,</v>

1796
00:44:07.751 --> 00:44:08.740
<v Speaker 7>on a normal curve,</v>

1797
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:12.520
<v Speaker 7>what does a DC brain potential DC brain potentials that you want to be like</v>

1798
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:13.200
<v Speaker 7>Daniel Cormier,</v>

1799
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 7>Yay we DC bring,</v>

1800
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.040
<v Speaker 7>I want to be a little bit like DC but uh,</v>

1801
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 7>basically it's uh,</v>

1802
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.500
<v Speaker 7>an objective measurement of your central nervous system.</v>

1803
00:44:20.501 --> 00:44:21.131
<v Speaker 7>So you can actually,</v>

1804
00:44:21.131 --> 00:44:24.280
<v Speaker 7>your central nervous system is basically the data aggregator if you will.</v>

1805
00:44:24.281 --> 00:44:27.340
<v Speaker 7>So it has to take information from your metabolic systems,</v>

1806
00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 7>your autonomics kind of coordinate things like neuromuscular and I met metabolic</v>

1807
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:32.544
<v Speaker 7>efficiency.</v>

1808
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.091
<v Speaker 7>That's kind of the,</v>

1809
00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:34.380
<v Speaker 7>the data center if you will.</v>

1810
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 7>So this is a measurement of a potential basically how much energy you have in</v>

1811
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:37.951
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1812
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 7>in the central nervous system to go coordinate neuro muscular and metabolic</v>

1813
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:42.204
<v Speaker 7>efficiencies,</v>

1814
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 7>which is really what we focus on.</v>

1815
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as this on like a chart or are you getting like is there a number of</v>

1816
00:44:48.221 --> 00:44:49.190
<v Speaker 1>reading that you're getting?</v>

1817
00:44:49.191 --> 00:44:50.024
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it that</v>

1818
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.810
<v Speaker 7>correct specifically for dcs,</v>

1819
00:44:51.811 --> 00:44:54.600
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be in millivolts and then you just compare that to normative</v>

1820
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:55.021
<v Speaker 7>ranges.</v>

1821
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 7>But most importantly,</v>

1822
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:56.431
<v Speaker 7>what it is,</v>

1823
00:44:56.431 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 7>is trending data over time.</v>

1824
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Speaker 7>This is an assessment that we would do on Henry every single morning.</v>

1825
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 7>It's a home test kit.</v>

1826
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 7>We really believe in just collecting as much data as possible and trending data.</v>

1827
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.390
<v Speaker 7>That way when you see a change essentially get predictability in terms of now</v>

1828
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:13.050
<v Speaker 7>today's a no go day because central nervous system is diminished.</v>

1829
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 7>We're just going to be going through the motions.</v>

1830
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.260
<v Speaker 7>We're not going to make physiological adaptations.</v>

1831
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:16.750
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1832
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 7>and your inflammation is really high.</v>

1833
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.050
<v Speaker 7>No go because we're not going to go risk injury when we can't make adaptations.</v>

1834
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.050
<v Speaker 7>So this is a measurement we would do every single morning where we can look at</v>

1835
00:45:25.051 --> 00:45:26.310
<v Speaker 7>autonomic nervous system,</v>

1836
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 7>which is basically things like recovery,</v>

1837
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:28.651
<v Speaker 7>sympathetic,</v>

1838
00:45:28.651 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 7>parasympathetic balance,</v>

1839
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 7>DC brain potentials and metabolic systems.</v>

1840
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.271
<v Speaker 7>What is,</v>

1841
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:34.830
<v Speaker 7>what is measuring all these things?</v>

1842
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 7>Is there a device?</v>

1843
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:36.684
<v Speaker 7>Is it a yeah.</v>

1844
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:36.961
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1845
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 7>This is a pretty amazing device.</v>

1846
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 7>We actually got it from the UFC performance institute,</v>

1847
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:41.161
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1848
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 7>shout out to those guys,</v>

1849
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 7>Clint Bobo and Roman over there.</v>

1850
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.250
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1851
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.760
<v Speaker 7>set us up with this technology to basically a chest strap that does heart rate</v>

1852
00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:48.391
<v Speaker 7>variability.</v>

1853
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 7>So time and frequency domain analysis.</v>

1854
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 7>And then it does DC brain potential.</v>

1855
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 7>So they'll stick your right here on your forehead,</v>

1856
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1857
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 7>basically four minutes.</v>

1858
00:45:56.341 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 7>You just kind of relax and we collect pretty amazing data and it breaks it down</v>

1859
00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 7>into four different categories.</v>

1860
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 7>What's called windows of trainability.</v>

1861
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 7>So it says today we should focus on strength and power or skill acquisition</v>

1862
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 7>based on metabolic readiness,</v>

1863
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 7>autonomic readiness in DC brain potentials.</v>

1864
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.230
<v Speaker 7>So what is our body prime to go do today?</v>

1865
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 7>Cause if you're not primed,</v>

1866
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 7>your nervous system doesn't have the energy just going to be going through the</v>

1867
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:18.264
<v Speaker 7>motions.</v>

1868
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.800
<v Speaker 1>So you were sort of there to dictate when it's going to be a hard day,</v>

1869
00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:23.240
<v Speaker 1>when it's going to be an easy day.</v>

1870
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:23.831
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>

1871
00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:24.041
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1872
00:46:24.041 --> 00:46:25.120
<v Speaker 7>And that's something as you,</v>

1873
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:26.740
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure you guys know in wrestling it's,</v>

1874
00:46:26.741 --> 00:46:28.090
<v Speaker 7>it's always hard always.</v>

1875
00:46:28.091 --> 00:46:28.900
<v Speaker 7>Let's go.</v>

1876
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.051
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1877
00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:29.601
<v Speaker 7>so this was a,</v>

1878
00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:31.660
<v Speaker 7>a little bit of an issue in the camp at the very beginning.</v>

1879
00:46:31.661 --> 00:46:33.580
<v Speaker 7>If you could imagine Henry wakes up,</v>

1880
00:46:33.581 --> 00:46:36.250
<v Speaker 7>it's a sparring day or maybe even supposed to do two a days.</v>

1881
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.760
<v Speaker 7>He wakes up feeling really good and nervous system is out of whack.</v>

1882
00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.331
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1883
00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:40.841
<v Speaker 7>sorry man,</v>

1884
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:42.730
<v Speaker 7>I know you feel good but you're not,</v>

1885
00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.653
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1886
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:44.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1887
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.360
<v Speaker 7>So we would go or no go that day.</v>

1888
00:46:46.361 --> 00:46:47.320
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

1889
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:48.250
<v Speaker 7>as you could see,</v>

1890
00:46:48.251 --> 00:46:49.630
<v Speaker 7>it all worked out in the long run.</v>

1891
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh fantastic.</v>

1892
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:54.750
<v Speaker 1>What was that weird for you to feel good and then do we told you got to chill</v>

1893
00:46:54.751 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1894
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1895
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1896
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>

1897
00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it almost takes a while to kind of adapt.</v>

1898
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 1>But I started as I started recognizing like my body change in how I felt</v>

1899
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:05.550
<v Speaker 1>inspiring or how they were and how Kinda I,</v>

1900
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I just felt recovered.</v>

1901
00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:07.171
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1902
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:07.471
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1903
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:08.304
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1904
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:09.570
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1905
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't run at all this whole camp.</v>

1906
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So do you get a baseline off of this,</v>

1907
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:14.461
<v Speaker 1>Eric?</v>

1908
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>You got to stop moving around.</v>

1909
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.373
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking me out.</v>

1910
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the hand signals back there,</v>

1911
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.070
<v Speaker 1>translating for the deaf people.</v>

1912
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do a baseline on this before you get started and then you as</v>

1913
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 1>before camp gets started and then when camp starts ramping up,</v>

1914
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

1915
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.840
<v Speaker 7>you start measuring all the various details,</v>

1916
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:32.321
<v Speaker 7>correct?</v>

1917
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:32.521
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1918
00:47:32.521 --> 00:47:34.660
<v Speaker 7>so we do a comprehensive baseline assessment,</v>

1919
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 7>including the Omegawave as well as,</v>

1920
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:36.521
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1921
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 7>six or eight hours of other testing,</v>

1922
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:40.030
<v Speaker 7>everything that you could think of under the sun.</v>

1923
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 7>And we put together a basically columns of this is what your sub optimal at,</v>

1924
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 7>this is what your average at,</v>

1925
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 7>this is what you're really damn good at.</v>

1926
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 7>So basically what we want to do is explore your functional strengths.</v>

1927
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 7>It's what you're good at.</v>

1928
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 7>But then we also want to focus on your functional deficiencies.</v>

1929
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 7>In a sport like MMA,</v>

1930
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:57.730
<v Speaker 7>we also sometimes have the advantage of looking at your opponent and making</v>

1931
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 7>certain assumptions in terms of their weaknesses,</v>

1932
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 7>their strengths going against somebody like Dj,</v>

1933
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:02.231
<v Speaker 7>you don't,</v>

1934
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 7>you don't really have that advantage.</v>

1935
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:06.370
<v Speaker 7>So we really needed to focus on is what Henry is really good at.</v>

1936
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 7>His ground game.</v>

1937
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:07.781
<v Speaker 7>You look,</v>

1938
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:07.931
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1939
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:10.630
<v Speaker 7>we're doing nervous system assessments while he's on the ground.</v>

1940
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.960
<v Speaker 7>His sparring partners or stresses sins are going like crazy.</v>

1941
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 7>He's calming down cause this guy likes to be on the floor rolling around.</v>

1942
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.690
<v Speaker 7>So we pinpoint these little strategic dif dif,</v>

1943
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Speaker 7>a strengths and deficiencies and then we target all of us a nutrition</v>

1944
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.250
<v Speaker 7>supplementation.</v>

1945
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 7>A big thing that we focus on is nutrient timing.</v>

1946
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:30.280
<v Speaker 7>Something that's not really talked about as well when you're talking about gut</v>

1947
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:31.091
<v Speaker 7>health and you know,</v>

1948
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:31.781
<v Speaker 7>recovery,</v>

1949
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 7>managing the hormones associated with exercise,</v>

1950
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.670
<v Speaker 7>you gotta be getting in the right nutrients in your,</v>

1951
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:37.600
<v Speaker 7>your energy,</v>

1952
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 7>Anabolic and growth phases.</v>

1953
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 7>So for nutrient timing,</v>

1954
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:43.360
<v Speaker 7>you talking about like when you're actually eating and what you're eating.</v>

1955
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:44.860
<v Speaker 7>So you're planning that out as well.</v>

1956
00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.910
<v Speaker 7>100% yes.</v>

1957
00:48:45.911 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 7>So we put together a nutrition program and because training varies every morning</v>

1958
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 7>we're deciding what we're going to do for the day.</v>

1959
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.260
<v Speaker 7>It's completely dynamic.</v>

1960
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:53.501
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1961
00:48:53.501 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 7>we're kind of reinventing the game of periodization and programming because you</v>

1962
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 7>can't give somebody an eight week plan.</v>

1963
00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:00.280
<v Speaker 7>You have to check every single day.</v>

1964
00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:04.360
<v Speaker 7>This is how you stay very dynamic and you avoid plateaus and just the issues,</v>

1965
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:04.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1966
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 7>it's always going to lead to suboptimal performance if you're programming out.</v>

1967
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.310
<v Speaker 7>So every day we adjust,</v>

1968
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:09.461
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1969
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 7>we're doing this intensity of training.</v>

1970
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:14.710
<v Speaker 7>We did a vo two Max assessment so we know exactly how much glycogen you're</v>

1971
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:17.080
<v Speaker 7>burning at various levels of intensity.</v>

1972
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 7>We do heart rate tracking during your training.</v>

1973
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.721
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>

1974
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:21.730
<v Speaker 7>this is exactly what you have to replace following.</v>

1975
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 7>So I'm standing on the sidelines,</v>

1976
00:49:23.321 --> 00:49:23.531
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1977
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:26.890
<v Speaker 7>after every practice mixing up custom supplements for him as well.</v>

1978
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:27.940
<v Speaker 7>So this is something,</v>

1979
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:28.774
<v Speaker 7>what kind of stuff?</v>

1980
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.260
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1981
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:29.471
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1982
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:31.120
<v Speaker 7>we have our own supplement line right now.</v>

1983
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:33.850
<v Speaker 7>I'm frankly not because the world needed another supplement line.</v>

1984
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 7>It's not really what our goal was.</v>

1985
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:35.771
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1986
00:49:35.771 --> 00:49:35.971
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

1987
00:49:35.971 --> 00:49:36.761
<v Speaker 7>in sports like this,</v>

1988
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 7>you have to be so careful what you're putting in these guys body.</v>

1989
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.311
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1990
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 7>so we just went the route of going GMP certified water.</v>

1991
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:44.050
<v Speaker 7>You sought approved on everything we do.</v>

1992
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:44.710
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1993
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:45.431
<v Speaker 7>eventually we want to,</v>

1994
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:45.600
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1995
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Speaker 7>try and work with the bad ass company cause we're not,</v>

1996
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 7>we don't want to be in the supplement game.</v>

1997
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 7>For us it was just quality control.</v>

1998
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.921
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1999
00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

2000
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:51.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2001
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 7>being a nervous system based company,</v>

2002
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 7>obviously we're doing things like Omega three Dhas Bcas,</v>

2003
00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:57.740
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2004
00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.391
<v Speaker 7>to maintain,</v>

2005
00:49:58.391 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 7>put on a little bit of muscle.</v>

2006
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:00.191
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2007
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 7>we do a lot of big one I believe in this is the generation you can,</v>

2008
00:50:03.461 --> 00:50:07.420
<v Speaker 7>the SuperStarch very good without a big glycaemic in a big insulin response,</v>

2009
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 7>but very good at replenishing your glycogen stores following to minimize</v>

2010
00:50:10.931 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 7>cortisol and inflammatory responses and things like that.</v>

2011
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.290
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2012
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:14.561
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2013
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 7>everyday it's a little bit different.</v>

2014
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>

2015
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:16.451
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2016
00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:19.560
<v Speaker 7>we ended up going with our own line and one of the biggest things that we didn't</v>

2017
00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.260
<v Speaker 7>ever really talk about in the fight as well is the,</v>

2018
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.780
<v Speaker 7>the role that gut health place.</v>

2019
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:26.020
<v Speaker 7>So that's something Henry does year round regardless of when we're fighting is</v>

2020
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:26.771
<v Speaker 7>take our line,</v>

2021
00:50:26.771 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 7>which is called freedom cleansers store.</v>

2022
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Speaker 7>And this is world renown,</v>

2023
00:50:29.781 --> 00:50:30.100
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2024
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.500
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2025
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 7>utilize by university researchers all around the world right now.</v>

2026
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 7>And basically it's all just about restoring good gut bacteria,</v>

2027
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.821
<v Speaker 7>prebiotics,</v>

2028
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 7>probiotics and lymphatic cleansing.</v>

2029
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.390
<v Speaker 7>And this is going to be something,</v>

2030
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:41.720
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2031
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 7>that really played a big role in his weight cut as well.</v>

2032
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:46.370
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of a missing link that athletes aren't talking about,</v>

2033
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 7>but good gut health is going to help with serotonin production.</v>

2034
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:50.061
<v Speaker 7>So recovery,</v>

2035
00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 7>relaxation,</v>

2036
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 7>mood,</v>

2037
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:52.131
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2038
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:54.370
<v Speaker 7>production of brain derived neurotrophic factor.</v>

2039
00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 7>So our nervous system can make these adaptations and learn new skills and things</v>

2040
00:50:58.371 --> 00:50:59.204
<v Speaker 7>along these lines.</v>

2041
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:00.290
<v Speaker 7>So this is something,</v>

2042
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2043
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:01.430
<v Speaker 7>in my opinion,</v>

2044
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.540
<v Speaker 7>a big reason why,</v>

2045
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:03.050
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2046
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:03.540
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2047
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.480
<v Speaker 7>he had the issue with Dj the first time around.</v>

2048
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 7>Henry Henry will tell the story like he had gut inflammation so bad that people</v>

2049
00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 7>would say good luck before the fight.</v>

2050
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:12.070
<v Speaker 7>Tap His gut and,</v>

2051
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.013
<v Speaker 7>and that hurt him.</v>

2052
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.341
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2053
00:51:13.341 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 7>that's not normal.</v>

2054
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:17.690
<v Speaker 7>That all goes back to the issues associated with weight cutting as we were</v>

2055
00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 7>talking about a little bit.</v>

2056
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:19.351
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>

2057
00:51:19.351 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 7>getting that gut health right,</v>

2058
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:21.720
<v Speaker 7>no inflammation in the,</v>

2059
00:51:21.721 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 7>and that goes a long way.</v>

2060
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

2061
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 7>how long have you guys been in business for a,</v>

2062
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 7>we've only been in business for about eight months.</v>

2063
00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:28.460
<v Speaker 7>We're still very new.</v>

2064
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.070
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2065
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.080
<v Speaker 7>been working with Henry A.</v>

2066
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 7>Little bit longer than that.</v>

2067
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.460
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2068
00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>

2069
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.500
<v Speaker 7>this company is just getting off the ground.</v>

2070
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:33.581
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

2071
00:51:33.581 --> 00:51:35.300
<v Speaker 7>we kind of rebranded a few months ago,</v>

2072
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.910
<v Speaker 7>just opened our first facility as well out in Scottsdale.</v>

2073
00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 7>What is your background in?</v>

2074
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:39.741
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2075
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:40.191
<v Speaker 7>I'm a,</v>

2076
00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:41.300
<v Speaker 7>I'm a physiologist.</v>

2077
00:51:41.301 --> 00:51:41.441
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2078
00:51:41.441 --> 00:51:45.080
<v Speaker 7>we opened the first mobile medical grade diagnostic testing company in Arizona.</v>

2079
00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 7>So basically I would have these diagnostics and largely it was trying to,</v>

2080
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 7>trying to fix the healthcare system a little bit,</v>

2081
00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:51.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2082
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:51.260
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2083
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:51.431
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

2084
00:51:51.431 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 7>we want individualized solutions.</v>

2085
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 7>We want datadriven outcomes,</v>

2086
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:54.891
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2087
00:51:54.891 --> 00:51:56.660
<v Speaker 7>You want quantifiable progress.</v>

2088
00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 7>So people want to feel good about what they're doing,</v>

2089
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:03.080
<v Speaker 7>but maybe a doctor can't afford a this big ass metabolic cart or they don't know</v>

2090
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:03.800
<v Speaker 7>how to use it.</v>

2091
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 7>So what I did is I purchased this equipment,</v>

2092
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 7>hire technicians,</v>

2093
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 7>and we would bring it mobile technology's getting smaller,</v>

2094
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:10.364
<v Speaker 7>more mobile.</v>

2095
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 7>So this was my idea of,</v>

2096
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:14.300
<v Speaker 7>of how I would go make my little dent in the healthcare system.</v>

2097
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:14.901
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2098
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:15.081
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2099
00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:17.840
<v Speaker 7>there were issues with scalability in terms of finding good technicians,</v>

2100
00:52:17.841 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 7>but the goal is just to go out there and provide data driven solutions,</v>

2101
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:21.420
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2102
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.430
<v Speaker 7>We live in a world of,</v>

2103
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 7>of subjectivity,</v>

2104
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:24.374
<v Speaker 7>guesswork,</v>

2105
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 7>a very punishment oriented fitness system where it sucks the start working out</v>

2106
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:29.380
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2107
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.940
<v Speaker 7>you typically gain weight if you're doing the right stuff cause you're getting</v>

2108
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:32.774
<v Speaker 7>hydrated,</v>

2109
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 7>you go get injured.</v>

2110
00:52:33.741 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2111
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 7>the goal is to redefine how we assess people so that we can find these little,</v>

2112
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 7>little tweaks for positive reinforcement.</v>

2113
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:40.711
<v Speaker 7>And that's a,</v>

2114
00:52:40.711 --> 00:52:42.800
<v Speaker 7>it goes a long way with healthcare as well as fitness.</v>

2115
00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.500
<v Speaker 7>So you guys mostly working with civilians,</v>

2116
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:47.270
<v Speaker 7>are you working with pro athletes?</v>

2117
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2118
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.450
<v Speaker 7>right now we're in the research and development phase so we're really only</v>

2119
00:52:50.451 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 7>working with guys like a Henry,</v>

2120
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:52.581
<v Speaker 7>Victoria,</v>

2121
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:52.941
<v Speaker 7>Anthony.</v>

2122
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:55.520
<v Speaker 7>I've a very bad ass dresser we're working with right now as well.</v>

2123
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:56.030
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2124
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:57.200
<v Speaker 7>just some amazing people.</v>

2125
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:57.560
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2126
00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.120
<v Speaker 7>largely for research and development.</v>

2127
00:52:59.121 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

2128
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Speaker 7>we trade them the training for the data.</v>

2129
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:01.401
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2130
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:02.960
<v Speaker 7>you guys get together.</v>

2131
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:03.531
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2132
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 7>we've been working with Henry about a year.</v>

2133
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>

2134
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:05.780
<v Speaker 7>I knew,</v>

2135
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 7>he knew our CEO,</v>

2136
00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 7>Karima mean a great guy.</v>

2137
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:10.850
<v Speaker 7>We've kind of all circle around a Korean.</v>

2138
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 7>He brought us all together.</v>

2139
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2140
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.220
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>

2141
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:13.550
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2142
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.940
<v Speaker 7>he came in probably about eight months ago for a little bit before the first</v>

2143
00:53:16.941 --> 00:53:19.150
<v Speaker 7>camp and we met talked and no,</v>

2144
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:19.821
<v Speaker 7>Henry was straight up.</v>

2145
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:20.091
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

2146
00:53:20.091 --> 00:53:20.680
<v Speaker 7>man you,</v>

2147
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.640
<v Speaker 7>you know your stuff but you don't know MMA.</v>

2148
00:53:22.641 --> 00:53:23.750
<v Speaker 7>So I took that,</v>

2149
00:53:23.751 --> 00:53:23.931
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2150
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:24.561
<v Speaker 7>personally we,</v>

2151
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:24.831
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2152
00:53:24.831 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 7>spent a lot of time together.</v>

2153
00:53:26.071 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 7>I had to learn the sport.</v>

2154
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.081
<v Speaker 7>I'm a physiologist,</v>

2155
00:53:28.081 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 7>not an MMA physiologist.</v>

2156
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 7>So we really took the time to get to know each other,</v>

2157
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2158
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.091
<v Speaker 7>hang out a lot.</v>

2159
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 7>Now I got to go to his house and wake them up every day for eight weeks.</v>

2160
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:37.100
<v Speaker 7>So that was,</v>

2161
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.460
<v Speaker 7>you got to know each other pretty well.</v>

2162
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 7>I do as meals trips and stuff much.</v>

2163
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2164
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 7>that's a fantastic</v>

2165
00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.610
<v Speaker 4>stick combination though.</v>

2166
00:53:43.611 --> 00:53:48.611
<v Speaker 4>A guy like you who knows so much about the body and recovery and a real super</v>

2167
00:53:48.801 --> 00:53:51.460
<v Speaker 4>high level Olympic gold medalist athlete.</v>

2168
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:51.711
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2169
00:53:51.711 --> 00:53:53.660
<v Speaker 4>when you get that combination mean that is,</v>

2170
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.740
<v Speaker 4>that's really a dream for God to like you and for a guy like you,</v>

2171
00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:00.680
<v Speaker 4>like for both of you guys to come together like this.</v>

2172
00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.780
<v Speaker 4>And I understand why you wanted to bring him on.</v>

2173
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.793
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2174
00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:04.520
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2175
00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:04.881
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2176
00:54:04.881 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2177
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:05.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2178
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 7>I understand half of,</v>

2179
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.620
<v Speaker 7>if you understand half of it.</v>

2180
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.120
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2181
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.790
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2182
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:12.110
<v Speaker 7>The DC mine thing,</v>

2183
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.030
<v Speaker 7>that Shit's important.</v>

2184
00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.051
<v Speaker 7>But no,</v>

2185
00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:15.410
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2186
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:18.950
<v Speaker 7>I do feel honored and blessed to be able to work with somebody like Henry.</v>

2187
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.630
<v Speaker 7>He's the hardest working guy out there.</v>

2188
00:54:20.631 --> 00:54:21.170
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2189
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:23.390
<v Speaker 7>and of course the hard work goes a long ways,</v>

2190
00:54:23.391 --> 00:54:23.781
<v Speaker 7>but man,</v>

2191
00:54:23.781 --> 00:54:25.220
<v Speaker 7>this guy's a genetic freak as well.</v>

2192
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.980
<v Speaker 7>I found the ability to test the Olympic athletes,</v>

2193
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.110
<v Speaker 7>many other sports as well.</v>

2194
00:54:30.111 --> 00:54:32.510
<v Speaker 7>This guy makes adaptations faster than anybody.</v>

2195
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.553
<v Speaker 7>He came off of,</v>

2196
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2197
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.693
<v Speaker 7>12 weeks,</v>

2198
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.690
<v Speaker 7>16 weeks maybe of not training vo two two's already in the high sixties</v>

2199
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.750
<v Speaker 7>functional threshold power is that would go compete with the,</v>

2200
00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:41.990
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2201
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.570
<v Speaker 7>worldclass ironmen that I'm training and things as well.</v>

2202
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:45.171
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

2203
00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:45.620
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2204
00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

2205
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:47.060
<v Speaker 7>we did some amazing stuff.</v>

2206
00:54:47.061 --> 00:54:50.600
<v Speaker 7>If you looked at the body composition changes that we did in seven weeks,</v>

2207
00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:52.100
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't even a full eight week camp.</v>

2208
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:52.640
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2209
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.520
<v Speaker 7>he put on 4.2 pounds of skeletal muscle mass,</v>

2210
00:54:55.521 --> 00:54:56.271
<v Speaker 7>like good mass,</v>

2211
00:54:56.271 --> 00:54:59.450
<v Speaker 7>which as a physiologist I would call bullshit on if I didn't see it with my own</v>

2212
00:54:59.451 --> 00:55:00.050
<v Speaker 7>two eyes.</v>

2213
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:00.890
<v Speaker 7>That's pretty incredible.</v>

2214
00:55:00.891 --> 00:55:01.131
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2215
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:01.690
<v Speaker 7>Incredible.</v>

2216
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:02.870
<v Speaker 7>And Henry will tell you,</v>

2217
00:55:02.871 --> 00:55:05.060
<v Speaker 7>he may be picked up weights like three or four times.</v>

2218
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:08.690
<v Speaker 7>We don't really do traditional strength training because you know,</v>

2219
00:55:08.691 --> 00:55:09.500
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people just,</v>

2220
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.240
<v Speaker 7>it's called vector based training.</v>

2221
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.700
<v Speaker 7>So a lot of people do things like squats and dead lifts.</v>

2222
00:55:13.701 --> 00:55:14.990
<v Speaker 7>This is an axial plane,</v>

2223
00:55:14.991 --> 00:55:16.940
<v Speaker 7>like we don't live in this up and down plain.</v>

2224
00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.590
<v Speaker 7>So we break it down by vector,</v>

2225
00:55:18.591 --> 00:55:19.281
<v Speaker 7>what angles,</v>

2226
00:55:19.281 --> 00:55:23.060
<v Speaker 7>what does he need to exert and absorb force and very effectively and very really</v>

2227
00:55:23.061 --> 00:55:25.220
<v Speaker 7>does that come down to actually utilizing weights.</v>

2228
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:29.330
<v Speaker 7>We do things like positional isom metrics and east centric training and things</v>

2229
00:55:29.331 --> 00:55:30.164
<v Speaker 7>along these lines.</v>

2230
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:30.921
<v Speaker 7>Number one,</v>

2231
00:55:30.921 --> 00:55:32.990
<v Speaker 7>they integrate with the nervous system very effectively.</v>

2232
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 7>Symmetrics yeah,</v>

2233
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.220
<v Speaker 7>positional isometric like planks.</v>

2234
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:38.181
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's,</v>

2235
00:55:38.181 --> 00:55:39.380
<v Speaker 7>that's kind of a low level of it.</v>

2236
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:39.561
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2237
00:55:39.561 --> 00:55:42.260
<v Speaker 7>Largely what you would want to do is like a biomechanical assessment,</v>

2238
00:55:42.261 --> 00:55:44.360
<v Speaker 7>look at overactive and underactive muscles,</v>

2239
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.480
<v Speaker 7>and then you put them in very specific positions and you leverage what's called</v>

2240
00:55:47.481 --> 00:55:49.340
<v Speaker 7>recip reciprocal inhibition.</v>

2241
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.421
<v Speaker 7>So basically,</v>

2242
00:55:50.421 --> 00:55:51.740
<v Speaker 7>and then the most basic term,</v>

2243
00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:53.120
<v Speaker 7>like when I'm flexing my Bicep,</v>

2244
00:55:53.121 --> 00:55:54.560
<v Speaker 7>my tricep is relaxing.</v>

2245
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:57.830
<v Speaker 7>So you'd hold certain positions that you want to turn on certain muscles and</v>

2246
00:55:57.831 --> 00:55:59.090
<v Speaker 7>kind of turn off other ones.</v>

2247
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.940
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of a high level of of PNF stretching,</v>

2248
00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:04.550
<v Speaker 7>proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.</v>

2249
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.950
<v Speaker 7>So this is what would be done in like a PT office.</v>

2250
00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.460
<v Speaker 4>So w in like for wrestling,</v>

2251
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:14.900
<v Speaker 4>like what kind of exercises would you do that would incorporate those methods?</v>

2252
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:16.260
<v Speaker 7>I mean wrestling is you know,</v>

2253
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.740
<v Speaker 7>largely a torsional sports.</v>

2254
00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.690
<v Speaker 7>So when it comes to wrestling we do things like,</v>

2255
00:56:19.691 --> 00:56:20.261
<v Speaker 7>like Kaiser,</v>

2256
00:56:20.261 --> 00:56:22.360
<v Speaker 7>like pneumatic compressions and things like that.</v>

2257
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 7>So instead of weights we use air pressure.</v>

2258
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:25.091
<v Speaker 7>Basically.</v>

2259
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:25.930
<v Speaker 7>It's very smooth,</v>

2260
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 7>very low risk of injury.</v>

2261
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 7>And they live in this arm,</v>

2262
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:29.490
<v Speaker 7>this torsional plane.</v>

2263
00:56:29.491 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 7>So you do a lot of transverse plane and we do a lot of velocity based training</v>

2264
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:34.150
<v Speaker 7>as well.</v>

2265
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 7>Actually really interesting.</v>

2266
00:56:35.081 --> 00:56:36.700
<v Speaker 7>A study that was published recently.</v>

2267
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.010
<v Speaker 7>A,</v>

2268
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 7>they had a lot of guys working on it for a full year.</v>

2269
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:40.530
<v Speaker 7>Some only did velocity,</v>

2270
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 7>never actually picked up a weight.</v>

2271
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 7>The other ones that traditional strength training,</v>

2272
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.280
<v Speaker 7>the people who did velocity based training now,</v>

2273
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 7>no actual weight training got stronger with less muscular hypertrophy.</v>

2274
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 7>I mean they didn't get as big but they were stronger at the end of the day.</v>

2275
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.800
<v Speaker 7>So when you look at something like wrestling and MMA where you got to make a low</v>

2276
00:56:56.801 --> 00:56:58.540
<v Speaker 7>weight but you want to be shown as possible,</v>

2277
00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:58.901
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2278
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 7>velocity based training is kind of the way of the future.</v>

2279
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:05.040
<v Speaker 7>So this is kind of our general gym concept that we're building right now is,</v>

2280
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.411
<v Speaker 7>is you know,</v>

2281
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 7>the gym of the future may not need weights.</v>

2282
00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:07.890
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2283
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 7>we're going to be next door to these crossfit gyms where they're throwing all</v>

2284
00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 7>these weights over their head,</v>

2285
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:15.070
<v Speaker 7>getting injured or next door empty gym and people are getting stronger.</v>

2286
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.371
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

2287
00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 7>that's kind of the,</v>

2288
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.220
<v Speaker 7>the gym of the future,</v>

2289
00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 7>the way we see it.</v>

2290
00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.530
<v Speaker 7>How would you divine velocity based training.</v>

2291
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.131
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2292
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:23.920
<v Speaker 7>so basically what you want to do is it's kind of like the new one rep Max.</v>

2293
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 7>We all know one rep Max is aren't the safest thing to perform,</v>

2294
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:27.080
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2295
00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 7>So you would,</v>

2296
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2297
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.080
<v Speaker 7>there's different assessments.</v>

2298
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:31.000
<v Speaker 7>Actually what I'm wearing here on my wrist right now,</v>

2299
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 7>this is the wearable tech of the future.</v>

2300
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:34.360
<v Speaker 7>This is something we're testing right now.</v>

2301
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.500
<v Speaker 7>This does velocity.</v>

2302
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 7>So I could send in any position,</v>

2303
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 7>I could do a push press or I could do a punch.</v>

2304
00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.810
<v Speaker 7>This is going to measure my velocity.</v>

2305
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:45.100
<v Speaker 7>Your Max Velocity at no weight would be your one rep Max velocity basically.</v>

2306
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.121
<v Speaker 7>And then you're going in,</v>

2307
00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 7>you're doing your training.</v>

2308
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:47.920
<v Speaker 7>So Max velocity,</v>

2309
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 7>every single rep,</v>

2310
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 7>when you hit 20% dampening,</v>

2311
00:57:50.861 --> 00:57:52.840
<v Speaker 7>so see I was at 10 meters per second.</v>

2312
00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 7>As soon as I hit eight meters or eight meters per second,</v>

2313
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.260
<v Speaker 7>I stop.</v>

2314
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 7>So this is kind of what they call fatigue.</v>

2315
00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 7>So you stopped that.</v>

2316
00:57:59.021 --> 00:57:59.980
<v Speaker 7>So instead of doing,</v>

2317
00:57:59.981 --> 00:58:00.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2318
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.360
<v Speaker 7>you're going to do eight reps,</v>

2319
00:58:01.361 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 7>you do as many reps as you can until you reach a certain dampening of velocity.</v>

2320
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.190
<v Speaker 7>And what are you doing them with?</v>

2321
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.530
<v Speaker 7>Largely things like the Kaiser,</v>

2322
00:58:08.531 --> 00:58:09.460
<v Speaker 7>the functional trainer,</v>

2323
00:58:09.461 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 7>if you're familiar with that blasting band work.</v>

2324
00:58:11.891 --> 00:58:12.101
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2325
00:58:12.101 --> 00:58:12.701
<v Speaker 7>Things like that.</v>

2326
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:14.050
<v Speaker 7>I mean very rarely will throw like,</v>

2327
00:58:14.051 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2328
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.540
<v Speaker 7>Indian clubs and things like that in there as well.</v>

2329
00:58:16.541 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 7>So it all depends on the sport and what we're focusing on that day.</v>

2330
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:20.141
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2331
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 7>metabolic readiness,</v>

2332
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 7>things along those lines.</v>

2333
00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 7>But it's all just about training in the right vectors and being able to not only</v>

2334
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:28.360
<v Speaker 7>put out force but absorb force as well,</v>

2335
00:58:28.361 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 7>which nobody really talks about.</v>

2336
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 7>And if you look at largely other professional sports,</v>

2337
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.810
<v Speaker 7>all these injuries are happening in the deceleration phase.</v>

2338
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:36.430
<v Speaker 7>So when people are trying to slow down,</v>

2339
00:58:36.431 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 7>this is absorbing force.</v>

2340
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 7>This is kind of similar through some of the pieces that just aren't trained in</v>

2341
00:58:41.261 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 7>MMA as well has got to be able to absorb force just like you put it out.</v>

2342
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.920
<v Speaker 7>Now when you met this risk thing that you're wearing,</v>

2343
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 7>it measures velocity.</v>

2344
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.370
<v Speaker 7>So how's it doing that?</v>

2345
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:51.971
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2346
00:58:51.971 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 7>so basically I have one here and then I have one on my shoe as well.</v>

2347
00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 7>So it can do it by using two sensors that can measure relative velocity.</v>

2348
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 7>So it's reading one relative to the other.</v>

2349
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 7>This is also doing everything that a bad ass traditional wearable would do as</v>

2350
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:04.361
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>

2351
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 7>So it's doing my heart rate,</v>

2352
00:59:05.951 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 7>heart rate variability,</v>

2353
00:59:06.911 --> 00:59:08.260
<v Speaker 7>which is actually clinical grade.</v>

2354
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 7>Everything we do has got to be clinical grade cause what's the point of</v>

2355
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:12.090
<v Speaker 7>collecting data if it's shit right.</v>

2356
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:12.611
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2357
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:14.200
<v Speaker 7>and then it does pulse oximetry.</v>

2358
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:16.210
<v Speaker 7>So I'm looking at my oxygen saturation.</v>

2359
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 7>The next version is going to be able to do hydration,</v>

2360
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:20.230
<v Speaker 7>all kinds of bad stuff.</v>

2361
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 7>What's really cool about it as well as it can measure form any exercise that</v>

2362
00:59:24.381 --> 00:59:24.891
<v Speaker 7>you're doing.</v>

2363
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:27.440
<v Speaker 7>We can compare you essentially to an ideal form.</v>

2364
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 7>And because we have to,</v>

2365
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:29.601
<v Speaker 7>you don't even have to tell it.</v>

2366
00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 7>You're doing a power clean,</v>

2367
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 7>it can read your motions and things like that.</v>

2368
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 7>And it gives you like a consistency number as well.</v>

2369
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:36.081
<v Speaker 7>So we,</v>

2370
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 7>one thing we really talk about is is not building muscle on top of dysfunction.</v>

2371
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:43.610
<v Speaker 7>We have to get your biomechanical patterns right first and then we start putting</v>

2372
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 7>muscle on.</v>

2373
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 7>If you just put muscle on top of dysfunction,</v>

2374
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:48.170
<v Speaker 7>you're facili facilitating further dysfunction.</v>

2375
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.970
<v Speaker 7>Would you have to wear one of those on each hand?</v>

2376
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:50.571
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2377
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:51.790
<v Speaker 7>I mean I'd say the fee,</v>

2378
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 7>ideally for someone like a fighter,</v>

2379
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 7>you obviously you're thrown with both hands.</v>

2380
00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2381
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 7>I think it would be ideal.</v>

2382
00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2383
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.771
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2384
00:59:57.771 --> 01:00:01.700
<v Speaker 7>it's really difficult at time sync multiple devices to be on the same timeline.</v>

2385
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.660
<v Speaker 7>So that's something we're working with this company,</v>

2386
01:00:03.661 --> 01:00:07.070
<v Speaker 7>an amazing company actually out of here at to La to develop this thing right</v>

2387
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:07.341
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

2388
01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:08.990
<v Speaker 7>So that I would say that'd be the goal.</v>

2389
01:00:08.991 --> 01:00:09.091
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2390
01:00:09.091 --> 01:00:12.410
<v Speaker 7>it's not something that's going to be applicable to the average guy though as</v>

2391
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:12.681
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>

2392
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:12.930
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>

2393
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:15.020
<v Speaker 7>we're trying to bring this type of training to everybody.</v>

2394
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 7>Would it be possible instead of time sinking it,</v>

2395
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 7>you have a left and a right computer,</v>

2396
01:00:19.941 --> 01:00:23.120
<v Speaker 7>like two different computers that are reading data both on one off the left,</v>

2397
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:23.750
<v Speaker 7>one off the rights.</v>

2398
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.100
<v Speaker 7>So you don't have to coordinate them.</v>

2399
01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 7>You just look at the various data.</v>

2400
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:27.651
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2401
01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:28.191
<v Speaker 7>at the end of the day,</v>

2402
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.570
<v Speaker 7>you still would have to sync them,</v>

2403
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:29.781
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

2404
01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:30.950
<v Speaker 7>So the thing there,</v>

2405
01:00:30.951 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 7>you'd be collecting it in two different sets of hardware.</v>

2406
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 7>You'd want an API connectivity,</v>

2407
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 7>put it up in the cloud,</v>

2408
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 7>and then you'd still at the end of the day have to find the same time axis.</v>

2409
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:39.030
<v Speaker 7>So it,</v>

2410
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.120
<v Speaker 7>it sounds simpler than it really would be.</v>

2411
01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:44.330
<v Speaker 7>That's why this is the only wearable in the world right now that has even one in</v>

2412
01:00:44.331 --> 01:00:45.020
<v Speaker 7>the foot.</v>

2413
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.750
<v Speaker 7>And so this also allows you to track your gate while you're running and things</v>

2414
01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:48.141
<v Speaker 7>as well.</v>

2415
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:50.350
<v Speaker 7>But the more devices the more complex in,</v>

2416
01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:50.511
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

2417
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:50.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2418
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:54.530
<v Speaker 7>that's something I think would be great but maybe not applicable to everybody.</v>

2419
01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 7>Is it going to be able to track martial arts moves?</v>

2420
01:00:56.601 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 7>Like will it be able to track a double leg take down or a roundhouse kick or</v>

2421
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 7>anything like that?</v>

2422
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.060
<v Speaker 7>Right now you can program it to do anything.</v>

2423
01:01:03.061 --> 01:01:03.320
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2424
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.360
<v Speaker 7>you put it into a kind of like a learning mode on the,</v>

2425
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 7>on your app,</v>

2426
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.190
<v Speaker 7>you do a few motions,</v>

2427
01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:07.761
<v Speaker 7>you name it,</v>

2428
01:01:07.761 --> 01:01:08.460
<v Speaker 7>and then it can,</v>

2429
01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 7>can basically compare you to yourself in that mode.</v>

2430
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 7>So you can try and do perfect form and measure your form relative to yourself.</v>

2431
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.730
<v Speaker 7>But if you have shitty form,</v>

2432
01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:18.370
<v Speaker 7>you're comparing yourself to shitty for.</v>

2433
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.021
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

2434
01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 7>So it doesn't know any better.</v>

2435
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:20.661
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

2436
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:21.950
<v Speaker 7>So what we're doing right now,</v>

2437
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:22.110
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2438
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:22.281
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>

2439
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 7>which will be a little bit of a lengthy process is defining a library of perfect</v>

2440
01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:27.920
<v Speaker 7>form for everything that you could think of.</v>

2441
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:28.461
<v Speaker 7>And then this,</v>

2442
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:28.641
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2443
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 7>this is going to a lock telehealth and tell the training when you have something</v>

2444
01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:32.481
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

2445
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:34.290
<v Speaker 7>We can do remote programming and,</v>

2446
01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.430
<v Speaker 7>and have been,</v>

2447
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:35.600
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2448
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 7>be monitoring people's neuromuscular function,</v>

2449
01:01:37.431 --> 01:01:39.170
<v Speaker 7>their biomechanics completely remotely.</v>

2450
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.501
<v Speaker 7>So that's,</v>

2451
01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 7>that's really what we're going towards.</v>

2452
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.091
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2453
01:01:41.091 --> 01:01:42.410
<v Speaker 7>This is fascinating stuff man.</v>

2454
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:42.950
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2455
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.700
<v Speaker 7>there's always been a several aspects to getting a fighter ready for camp.</v>

2456
01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:48.350
<v Speaker 7>There's always been their skillset,</v>

2457
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 7>what they're good at,</v>

2458
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2459
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 7>specific training for that one individual opponent of they're going to face and</v>

2460
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.350
<v Speaker 7>then all the strength and conditioning and you know,</v>

2461
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 7>it's usually thought of as,</v>

2462
01:01:59.240 --> 01:01:59.571
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2463
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 7>weights and sprints and pliers and on all these different things.</v>

2464
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:06.110
<v Speaker 7>But I feel like this is probably the next step.</v>

2465
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.070
<v Speaker 7>The next step,</v>

2466
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:09.050
<v Speaker 7>measuring all of your,</v>

2467
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:13.610
<v Speaker 7>all these variables that you're talking about and seeing how your body is at any</v>

2468
01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:17.240
<v Speaker 7>given time so that you're not just guessing whether you're piquing your</v>

2469
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:18.710
<v Speaker 7>scientifically peaking.</v>

2470
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 7>Exactly man.</v>

2471
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:19.891
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's,</v>

2472
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 7>there's just no room for guesswork and subjectivity,</v>

2473
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:22.351
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2474
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:24.480
<v Speaker 7>at this level and in technology doesn't,</v>

2475
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 7>there's no need for it anymore.</v>

2476
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.800
<v Speaker 7>So we're just trying to let people know shit like this is available,</v>

2477
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:29.101
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2478
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:32.520
<v Speaker 7>So we're developing it and then the end goal is just to make it extremely user</v>

2479
01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:32.971
<v Speaker 7>friendly,</v>

2480
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:33.450
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2481
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.081
<v Speaker 7>So you're doing your,</v>

2482
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 7>your velocity based training and it says stop and then you rest and we're using</v>

2483
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:40.080
<v Speaker 7>your heart rate variability to tell you when to go again.</v>

2484
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:40.860
<v Speaker 7>So like,</v>

2485
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.130
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2486
01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:42.630
<v Speaker 7>it's easy to stop and go for your,</v>

2487
01:02:42.631 --> 01:02:46.650
<v Speaker 7>your periodization and things like that so that the technology's here now making</v>

2488
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:46.801
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2489
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:47.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2490
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:50.560
<v Speaker 7>actionable recommendations for the individual that can understand is,</v>

2491
01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 7>is kind of what we're moving towards.</v>

2492
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 4>This is awesome stuff,</v>

2493
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:53.740
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2494
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.160
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

2495
01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:54.281
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2496
01:02:54.281 --> 01:02:55.610
<v Speaker 7>we're really passionate about what we're doing.</v>

2497
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.340
<v Speaker 4>You've only been around for such a short amount of time to,</v>

2498
01:02:58.341 --> 01:02:59.900
<v Speaker 4>and yet you already have a world champion.</v>

2499
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:00.341
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2500
01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:00.921
<v Speaker 7>I know man.</v>

2501
01:03:00.921 --> 01:03:01.970
<v Speaker 7>I mean I feel,</v>

2502
01:03:01.971 --> 01:03:02.350
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2503
01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:05.090
<v Speaker 7>there's times where you feel like you didn't deserve the opportunity because</v>

2504
01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:05.231
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

2505
01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:06.110
<v Speaker 7>I'm new to the field,</v>

2506
01:03:06.111 --> 01:03:06.321
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2507
01:03:06.321 --> 01:03:08.060
<v Speaker 7>we obviously work our asses off and everything,</v>

2508
01:03:08.061 --> 01:03:08.820
<v Speaker 7>but the,</v>

2509
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.520
<v Speaker 7>for Henry to put the faith into us,</v>

2510
01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:10.940
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2511
01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.680
<v Speaker 7>this was a world champion camp.</v>

2512
01:03:12.681 --> 01:03:13.550
<v Speaker 7>We're a company.</v>

2513
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:13.881
<v Speaker 7>Honestly,</v>

2514
01:03:13.881 --> 01:03:14.714
<v Speaker 7>we're not even open yet.</v>

2515
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.320
<v Speaker 7>This is probably one of the best acceleration for a company that's never seen</v>

2516
01:03:18.321 --> 01:03:19.250
<v Speaker 7>the light of day ever.</v>

2517
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.790
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2518
01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:20.001
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2519
01:03:20.001 --> 01:03:21.770
<v Speaker 7>we also run a few other sports as well,</v>

2520
01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.281
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>

2521
01:03:22.281 --> 01:03:24.470
<v Speaker 7>for him to give us this opportunity and you know,</v>

2522
01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:27.980
<v Speaker 7>we felt like we owed them something so we worked extra hard,</v>

2523
01:03:27.981 --> 01:03:31.970
<v Speaker 7>essentially put our entire company on hold for eight weeks to go help him out.</v>

2524
01:03:31.971 --> 01:03:32.510
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

2525
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.380
<v Speaker 7>it's paying dividends.</v>

2526
01:03:33.381 --> 01:03:34.310
<v Speaker 7>Obviously we're here right now.</v>

2527
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Now are you guys going to be open to the general public?</v>

2528
01:03:37.301 --> 01:03:38.200
<v Speaker 4>Say the the,</v>

2529
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:42.580
<v Speaker 4>the average girl or guy who does say Jujitsu tournaments and wants to get in the</v>

2530
01:03:42.581 --> 01:03:47.020
<v Speaker 4>best shape of their life is are you going to have products for them and a</v>

2531
01:03:47.021 --> 01:03:49.240
<v Speaker 4>service where they can sign up for something like that.</v>

2532
01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.050
<v Speaker 7>Certainly right now we are already open in terms of of diagnostic testing.</v>

2533
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.360
<v Speaker 7>So you can come in based on your sport,</v>

2534
01:03:55.361 --> 01:03:55.811
<v Speaker 7>your goal,</v>

2535
01:03:55.811 --> 01:03:56.531
<v Speaker 7>whatever it may be.</v>

2536
01:03:56.531 --> 01:04:00.160
<v Speaker 7>We have customized diagnostic packages cause some assessments just aren't</v>

2537
01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:01.210
<v Speaker 7>applicable to some people.</v>

2538
01:04:01.211 --> 01:04:02.980
<v Speaker 7>So we customize your assessment.</v>

2539
01:04:02.981 --> 01:04:04.270
<v Speaker 7>We basically tell you what you're good at,</v>

2540
01:04:04.271 --> 01:04:05.104
<v Speaker 7>what you're bad at.</v>

2541
01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:06.220
<v Speaker 7>Then if you want to,</v>

2542
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2543
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.820
<v Speaker 7>develop a program that's a little bit of an upcharge to the real goal there is</v>

2544
01:04:09.821 --> 01:04:14.320
<v Speaker 7>to be able to do completely remote training completely in house training and</v>

2545
01:04:14.321 --> 01:04:16.330
<v Speaker 7>then any level of hybrid training as well.</v>

2546
01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:19.960
<v Speaker 7>So right now you know what the world needs is the diagnostic testing the data.</v>

2547
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:21.550
<v Speaker 7>We're already ready to do that.</v>

2548
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.820
<v Speaker 7>What we're building now is the processes of being able to use data,</v>

2549
01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.250
<v Speaker 7>put it into recommendations and then scale that.</v>

2550
01:04:27.251 --> 01:04:28.480
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to teach somebody,</v>

2551
01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:28.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2552
01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.830
<v Speaker 7>everything that I do.</v>

2553
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:30.790
<v Speaker 7>So we're building the,</v>

2554
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:31.151
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2555
01:04:31.151 --> 01:04:31.360
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2556
01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.640
<v Speaker 7>the software's to essentially replicate ourselves.</v>

2557
01:04:33.641 --> 01:04:34.170
<v Speaker 7>Like my,</v>

2558
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.050
<v Speaker 7>my buddy in the other room,</v>

2559
01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:35.741
<v Speaker 7>Andre Hicks,</v>

2560
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:38.080
<v Speaker 7>one of the best strength and conditioning coaches in the world.</v>

2561
01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.220
<v Speaker 7>These guys will attest to it.</v>

2562
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:39.710
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2563
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.890
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2564
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:41.680
<v Speaker 7>you can't teach people what he knows.</v>

2565
01:04:41.681 --> 01:04:45.760
<v Speaker 7>So we have to like code this into a software a lot of if then type stuff and</v>

2566
01:04:45.761 --> 01:04:48.100
<v Speaker 7>then this is a able to be scalable to everybody.</v>

2567
01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:49.450
<v Speaker 7>We want to provide this training,</v>

2568
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.040
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2569
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>

2570
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:53.170
<v Speaker 7>to people now the average Joe trying to lose weight,</v>

2571
01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:53.780
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2572
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.540
<v Speaker 7>the weekend warrior,</v>

2573
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:56.650
<v Speaker 7>the Jujitsu,</v>

2574
01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.221
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

2575
01:04:57.221 --> 01:04:59.020
<v Speaker 7>Then we want to be able to provide this to everybody.</v>

2576
01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:00.790
<v Speaker 7>Everybody deserves this type of training.</v>

2577
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.410
<v Speaker 7>That's minimal risk of injury,</v>

2578
01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:03.041
<v Speaker 7>high yield,</v>

2579
01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:04.330
<v Speaker 7>return efficient.</v>

2580
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.860
<v Speaker 7>That's what everyone's looking for and that's,</v>

2581
01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.230
<v Speaker 7>that's why the people are getting fatter.</v>

2582
01:05:08.231 --> 01:05:08.411
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

2583
01:05:08.411 --> 01:05:11.680
<v Speaker 7>there's no good positive reinforcement out there and there's no clear roadmap</v>

2584
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.180
<v Speaker 7>how to get to where you want to be.</v>

2585
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:13.691
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2586
01:05:13.691 --> 01:05:13.781
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

2587
01:05:13.781 --> 01:05:14.680
<v Speaker 7>we put together like,</v>

2588
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.011
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2589
01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.090
<v Speaker 7>comparing it to Google maps,</v>

2590
01:05:16.091 --> 01:05:16.950
<v Speaker 7>everybody knows their end.</v>

2591
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:17.981
<v Speaker 7>They know where they want to be,</v>

2592
01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 7>but it can't tell you where you're at unless you know exactly where you're</v>

2593
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 7>starting from.</v>

2594
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.290
<v Speaker 7>You have to do this baseline assessment and they'll sometimes,</v>

2595
01:05:23.291 --> 01:05:25.470
<v Speaker 7>it sucks to really understand how fat your,</v>

2596
01:05:25.471 --> 01:05:25.701
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2597
01:05:25.701 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 7>your body fat percentage and your metabolic,</v>

2598
01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 7>and you're at risk of,</v>

2599
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:29.501
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2600
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 7>your insulin resistance and things like that.</v>

2601
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 7>But you have to figure out where you're starting from,</v>

2602
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:34.421
<v Speaker 7>where you want to be.</v>

2603
01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Speaker 7>And that's how we develop a roadmap.</v>

2604
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 7>So getting people,</v>

2605
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:37.331
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2606
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:37.471
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2607
01:05:37.471 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 7>and we believe this is,</v>

2608
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 7>this is the way of kind of making our way into the healthcare system as well.</v>

2609
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:44.020
<v Speaker 7>That's our end goal as a company to be able to provide,</v>

2610
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2611
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.330
<v Speaker 7>integrative fitness is what we're calling it.</v>

2612
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 7>Taking little pieces from all the different methodologies of a fitness,</v>

2613
01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:50.210
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2614
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.381
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2615
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:50.581
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

2616
01:05:50.581 --> 01:05:53.440
<v Speaker 7>we bring meditation and Yoga into our practice as well.</v>

2617
01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 7>So little pieces of just about everything and be able to provide this to</v>

2618
01:05:57.281 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Speaker 7>everybody that that's what we're doing.</v>

2619
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.070
<v Speaker 7>So in the future,</v>

2620
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 7>when you guys are open,</v>

2621
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.671
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

2622
01:06:01.671 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 7>you're not totally open to the general public yet,</v>

2623
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:03.910
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2624
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.271
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>

2625
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:04.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2626
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.560
<v Speaker 7>about six or eight months.</v>

2627
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 7>Would someone have to come to you for the first initial assessments and then</v>

2628
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 7>possibly be able to do the consulting either online or you know,</v>

2629
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:13.541
<v Speaker 7>through,</v>

2630
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:15.130
<v Speaker 7>through the application?</v>

2631
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:15.431
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2632
01:06:15.431 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 7>there's totally different degrees.</v>

2633
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:19.180
<v Speaker 7>We have a hundred percent remote kits right now.</v>

2634
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:21.070
<v Speaker 7>There's bad ass stuff you can do on your iPad,</v>

2635
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 7>like biomechanical assessments that can find your joints and things like that.</v>

2636
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.110
<v Speaker 7>We can send this to you.</v>

2637
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.640
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of things that we want to be able to do.</v>

2638
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.030
<v Speaker 7>A hundred percent remote for the most complex assessment.</v>

2639
01:06:31.031 --> 01:06:31.721
<v Speaker 7>You got to come in,</v>

2640
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.730
<v Speaker 7>you got to do a vo two Max assessment.</v>

2641
01:06:33.731 --> 01:06:35.700
<v Speaker 7>We can't send you a metabolic cart and shit obviously.</v>

2642
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:39.520
<v Speaker 7>So the goal is to get people to just come into the facility and then do remote</v>

2643
01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 7>programming from there.</v>

2644
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:41.430
<v Speaker 7>And this is uh,</v>

2645
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2646
01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:41.900
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>

2647
01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 7>our concept is to put these diagnostic centers and possibly the attached</v>

2648
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:48.190
<v Speaker 7>training centers as well and just start providing these everywhere.</v>

2649
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:48.371
<v Speaker 7>Because,</v>

2650
01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:48.701
<v Speaker 7>frankly,</v>

2651
01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:49.220
<v Speaker 7>if we just went,</v>

2652
01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:49.421
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2653
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:49.580
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2654
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.670
<v Speaker 7>the diagnostic Jim of the future route,</v>

2655
01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.481
<v Speaker 7>it could be five,</v>

2656
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:54.040
<v Speaker 7>600 square feet low,</v>

2657
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:54.311
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2658
01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:56.770
<v Speaker 7>low overhead facilities that are just really efficient,</v>

2659
01:06:56.771 --> 01:06:56.951
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2660
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 7>just putting people out,</v>

2661
01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.350
<v Speaker 7>collecting data left and right.</v>

2662
01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.431
<v Speaker 7>That's amazing,</v>

2663
01:07:00.431 --> 01:07:00.611
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2664
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.181
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2666
01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:06.181
<v Speaker 7>what does it been like for you to make this gigantic change and to basically be</v>

2667
01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:07.570
<v Speaker 7>like Ivan Drago?</v>

2668
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2669
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.931
<v Speaker 5>pretty much.</v>

2670
01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:09.031
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2671
01:07:09.031 --> 01:07:09.170
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2672
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:10.400
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty much how,</v>

2673
01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:12.920
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of how it's kind of been like we took in that,</v>

2674
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:13.783
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2675
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 5>the Ivan Drago approach probably more than the rocky approach,</v>

2676
01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:19.010
<v Speaker 5>which I think,</v>

2677
01:07:19.011 --> 01:07:21.520
<v Speaker 5>I think Russia is kind of tend to use science a little bit more than their</v>

2678
01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.363
<v Speaker 5>training.</v>

2679
01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:23.151
<v Speaker 5>So to me,</v>

2680
01:07:23.151 --> 01:07:24.260
<v Speaker 5>at first it was almost like,</v>

2681
01:07:24.261 --> 01:07:24.501
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2682
01:07:24.501 --> 01:07:24.551
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2683
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:26.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm going all in on this,</v>

2684
01:07:26.271 --> 01:07:28.280
<v Speaker 5>especially this cap against Demetrius.</v>

2685
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:28.551
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2686
01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:28.821
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2687
01:07:28.821 --> 01:07:28.941
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2688
01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:29.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2689
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm going all in man.</v>

2690
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2691
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have faith in the science of why I got 100%.</v>

2692
01:07:33.921 --> 01:07:36.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna do everything according to even,</v>

2693
01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:36.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2694
01:07:36.621 --> 01:07:38.030
<v Speaker 5>even if even if I don't want to.</v>

2695
01:07:38.031 --> 01:07:38.864
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

2696
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:39.951
<v Speaker 5>and I think he just,</v>

2697
01:07:39.951 --> 01:07:41.540
<v Speaker 5>as I started seeing my body change,</v>

2698
01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:43.700
<v Speaker 5>I started seeing like the coaches kind of adapt with like,</v>

2699
01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:44.001
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2700
01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:45.900
<v Speaker 5>mass science is in the center of this whole cat.</v>

2701
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.800
<v Speaker 5>And I saw the change though.</v>

2702
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:51.890
<v Speaker 5>And I've never felt so recovered the night that I fought Demetrius Johnson,</v>

2703
01:07:51.891 --> 01:07:53.150
<v Speaker 5>I've never felt so good.</v>

2704
01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:56.120
<v Speaker 5>And I'm 31 years old and I've been cutting weight since I've,</v>

2705
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:57.440
<v Speaker 5>since I've been a kid.</v>

2706
01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:03.190
<v Speaker 5>So you felt a big difference through the entire camp doing this kind of method</v>

2707
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.340
<v Speaker 5>through the entire camp.</v>

2708
01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:05.210
<v Speaker 5>People would trip out.</v>

2709
01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:05.601
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like,</v>

2710
01:08:05.601 --> 01:08:06.141
<v Speaker 5>people were like,</v>

2711
01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:06.301
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2712
01:08:06.301 --> 01:08:06.801
<v Speaker 5>you're committed.</v>

2713
01:08:06.801 --> 01:08:07.250
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

2714
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.130
<v Speaker 5>that's suicide.</v>

2715
01:08:08.131 --> 01:08:08.241
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>

2716
01:08:08.241 --> 01:08:09.140
<v Speaker 5>how come you're not doing this?</v>

2717
01:08:09.141 --> 01:08:10.250
<v Speaker 5>How come you're not doing that?</v>

2718
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:11.721
<v Speaker 5>And a,</v>

2719
01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:13.100
<v Speaker 5>you would have to look at it and saying,</v>

2720
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.140
<v Speaker 5>how can we not doing like what specifically?</v>

2721
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:15.711
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

2722
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:16.371
<v Speaker 5>just a,</v>

2723
01:08:16.371 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 5>just a more work,</v>

2724
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:18.080
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>

2725
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 5>more pad work,</v>

2726
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 5>more uh,</v>

2727
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 5>more sparring rounds,</v>

2728
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:21.571
<v Speaker 5>like things of that man,</v>

2729
01:08:21.571 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to kind of like the gladiator stuff.</v>

2730
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.131
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

2731
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2732
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.990
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2733
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.780
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2734
01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 5>it's an a goal according to my heart rate.</v>

2735
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 5>It's going to,</v>

2736
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 5>it's going to go according to what?</v>

2737
01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:30.501
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2738
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 5>my windows,</v>

2739
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 5>what my train of my windows of opportunity of training are.</v>

2740
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.310
<v Speaker 5>You know what kind of Mumbo jumbo they're like,</v>

2741
01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2742
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody knows.</v>

2743
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Like the day that I wake up,</v>

2744
01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.230
<v Speaker 5>the day that I train,</v>

2745
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 5>like nobody knows what's going on until,</v>

2746
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:44.090
<v Speaker 5>until,</v>

2747
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:48.050
<v Speaker 5>until the data's got in the hands of Kevin and Neuro Force One and then they,</v>

2748
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:48.261
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2749
01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:48.920
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2750
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 5>they determine this is how many rounds,</v>

2751
01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 5>this is how we're going to kind of pick you for your fight.</v>

2752
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 7>If you could imagine standing on the sideline when he's like sparring and rounds</v>

2753
01:08:57.291 --> 01:08:59.130
<v Speaker 7>and stuff and more slow down periods here,</v>

2754
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.841
<v Speaker 7>like coaches,</v>

2755
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 7>like you can't do that.</v>

2756
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:01.671
<v Speaker 7>This is fighting.</v>

2757
01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:04.460
<v Speaker 7>You can't try and control your heart rate while training and now this is</v>

2758
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 7>training for fighting.</v>

2759
01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:05.601
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2760
01:09:05.601 --> 01:09:05.841
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2761
01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.471
<v Speaker 7>so we're,</v>

2762
01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:10.160
<v Speaker 7>we're telling constantly telling him to train less slow himself down.</v>

2763
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:10.581
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2764
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:13.700
<v Speaker 7>there was a little bit of clashing there at the beginning and then they started</v>

2765
01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:17.350
<v Speaker 7>to see the body composition come around and started to feel his power and,</v>

2766
01:09:17.351 --> 01:09:19.400
<v Speaker 7>and everyone kind of bought into the process.</v>

2767
01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:20.450
<v Speaker 7>But it takes a while.</v>

2768
01:09:20.451 --> 01:09:20.740
<v Speaker 7>We're not,</v>

2769
01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:20.901
<v Speaker 7>we're,</v>

2770
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:23.920
<v Speaker 7>we're redefining it and we understand that there's gonna be some pushback.</v>

2771
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 4>This is such a universal concept when it comes to strength and conditioning</v>

2772
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:28.641
<v Speaker 4>coaches,</v>

2773
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:32.990
<v Speaker 4>it's being discussed over and over again nowadays is that people are doing too</v>

2774
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:33.630
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>

2775
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 4>they're doing too much and your body's just doesn't have a chance to recover.</v>

2776
01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 4>And even though you're getting in better shape,</v>

2777
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.060
<v Speaker 4>ultimately you're not getting in as good a shape as you could have gotten if you</v>

2778
01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:44.894
<v Speaker 4>did less,</v>

2779
01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.300
<v Speaker 4>which is so counter intuitive for most people.</v>

2780
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2781
01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:48.720
<v Speaker 5>And that's Kinda how it,</v>

2782
01:09:48.721 --> 01:09:49.091
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2783
01:09:49.091 --> 01:09:49.780
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2784
01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.540
<v Speaker 5>that's Kinda how I used to train so hard,</v>

2785
01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:53.530
<v Speaker 5>but I used to get hurt.</v>

2786
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm a nice to have back spasms kicking.</v>

2787
01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.400
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how hard I would train.</v>

2788
01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:57.551
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2789
01:09:57.551 --> 01:09:59.320
<v Speaker 5>oh my back would literally go out just kicking.</v>

2790
01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:03.430
<v Speaker 5>I'll throw one kick and they had to pull me off the gym in a stretcher,</v>

2791
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2792
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.600
<v Speaker 5>and I had those problems because I had just,</v>

2793
01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:08.680
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

2794
01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.920
<v Speaker 5>I didn't you almost train according to you how,</v>

2795
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:13.320
<v Speaker 5>how you know what the,</v>

2796
01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:14.920
<v Speaker 5>how the schedule is rather than,</v>

2797
01:10:14.921 --> 01:10:15.221
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2798
01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:16.310
<v Speaker 5>this is this,</v>

2799
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:18.570
<v Speaker 5>this is the approach today because this is this,</v>

2800
01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:21.820
<v Speaker 5>this is how your stress levels are like relaxed too.</v>

2801
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:22.320
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2802
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.510
<v Speaker 5>and then at times you're going to go hard and it's,</v>

2803
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:26.340
<v Speaker 5>it'll spike you at target.</v>

2804
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.460
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2805
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:26.980
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2806
01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.813
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

2807
01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.700
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the</v>

2808
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 4>crazy contrast,</v>

2809
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:29.841
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2810
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:34.370
<v Speaker 4>As between this championship mentality that just wants to do more than anybody.</v>

2811
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.430
<v Speaker 4>Push harder train while everybody else is asleep.</v>

2812
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Put your body through more than anybody else is willing to do because that's</v>

2813
01:10:41.121 --> 01:10:43.880
<v Speaker 4>what makes a champion and then someone like you comes along goes,</v>

2814
01:10:43.881 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2815
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.133
<v Speaker 4>that's what more,</v>

2816
01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.220
<v Speaker 4>that's what fucks you up.</v>

2817
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 4>You need to slow down.</v>

2818
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 4>You do last less rounds.</v>

2819
01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Move slower.</v>

2820
01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:51.181
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2821
01:10:51.181 --> 01:10:51.601
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

2822
01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:53.190
<v Speaker 7>I mean that was one of the biggest things I told them.</v>

2823
01:10:53.191 --> 01:10:54.930
<v Speaker 7>If you're not sleeping eight to 10 hours a night,</v>

2824
01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:56.400
<v Speaker 7>when you're putting your body through something like that,</v>

2825
01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:59.610
<v Speaker 7>you're doing your body and injustice and you're not going to make adaptations</v>

2826
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.160
<v Speaker 7>when we're out there training or breaking our body down.</v>

2827
01:11:02.161 --> 01:11:03.270
<v Speaker 7>It needs this repair.</v>

2828
01:11:03.271 --> 01:11:03.820
<v Speaker 7>We need,</v>

2829
01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:04.190
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2830
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:05.520
<v Speaker 7>activate our glymphatic system,</v>

2831
01:11:05.521 --> 01:11:07.260
<v Speaker 7>our brains waste removal system as well.</v>

2832
01:11:07.261 --> 01:11:09.810
<v Speaker 7>So we can go learn some new things the next day as well.</v>

2833
01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:10.770
<v Speaker 7>So if you're not sleeping,</v>

2834
01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 7>you're sub optimal just like you're not properly hydrated and things as well.</v>

2835
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:14.881
<v Speaker 7>This is,</v>

2836
01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 7>this is all comes down to the cellular level,</v>

2837
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:17.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2838
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 7>nervous system based approach.</v>

2839
01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:23.670
<v Speaker 4>Now are you taking Melatonin or anything to ensure that you go to sleep at a</v>

2840
01:11:23.981 --> 01:11:25.030
<v Speaker 4>specific time?</v>

2841
01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Do you time your sleep sky schedule?</v>

2842
01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Like how are you organizing that?</v>

2843
01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2844
01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:30.381
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2845
01:11:30.381 --> 01:11:30.740
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2846
01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:31.840
<v Speaker 5>and that's another thing,</v>

2847
01:11:31.841 --> 01:11:32.770
<v Speaker 5>even at times,</v>

2848
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:33.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2849
01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.740
<v Speaker 5>according to when I would go to sleep.</v>

2850
01:11:35.741 --> 01:11:38.500
<v Speaker 5>Cause at that time do you know how you train late and sometimes you come back</v>

2851
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:40.870
<v Speaker 5>and it just takes you a while to go to sleep.</v>

2852
01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:41.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2853
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.520
<v Speaker 5>So even then it would,</v>

2854
01:11:42.521 --> 01:11:43.061
<v Speaker 5>it would it be like,</v>

2855
01:11:43.061 --> 01:11:43.421
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2856
01:11:43.421 --> 01:11:43.691
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

2857
01:11:43.691 --> 01:11:45.130
<v Speaker 5>when Henry's ready to wake up,</v>

2858
01:11:45.131 --> 01:11:45.964
<v Speaker 5>when it,</v>

2859
01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.280
<v Speaker 5>obviously if I don't hit my alarm and I snooze it,</v>

2860
01:11:48.281 --> 01:11:51.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm more lucky they can allow me to sleep an extra two hours,</v>

2861
01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.260
<v Speaker 5>which is important.</v>

2862
01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:53.531
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2863
01:11:53.531 --> 01:11:54.364
<v Speaker 5>So it's like the vibe,</v>

2864
01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:55.041
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of like we'll,</v>

2865
01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.470
<v Speaker 5>Floyd does flow will be like,</v>

2866
01:11:56.471 --> 01:11:56.621
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2867
01:11:56.621 --> 01:11:58.120
<v Speaker 5>we'll wake everybody up at three in the morning,</v>

2868
01:11:58.121 --> 01:12:00.130
<v Speaker 5>but there's no scientific to what flow is doing.</v>

2869
01:12:00.131 --> 01:12:01.030
<v Speaker 5>Like to us it's like,</v>

2870
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:01.893
<v Speaker 5>hey dude,</v>

2871
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:03.220
<v Speaker 5>let's we have to pick today.</v>

2872
01:12:03.221 --> 01:12:04.054
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2873
01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:07.720
<v Speaker 7>if there is science behind it and he just doesn't talk about it,</v>

2874
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.920
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2875
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.870
<v Speaker 7>it was Floyd like you don't know.</v>

2876
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.141
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2877
01:12:11.141 --> 01:12:11.974
<v Speaker 7>I like to think so.</v>

2878
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.401
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2879
01:12:12.401 --> 01:12:15.340
<v Speaker 7>Like when he drinks a Pepsi after a workout,</v>

2880
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.060
<v Speaker 7>it was like a wonder there's no science that I told him to do that,</v>

2881
01:12:19.061 --> 01:12:23.410
<v Speaker 7>to replenish his body with a ton of sugar and high glycemic carbs right after.</v>

2882
01:12:23.411 --> 01:12:24.700
<v Speaker 7>That's the only time it's really good.</v>

2883
01:12:24.701 --> 01:12:27.550
<v Speaker 7>That little 45 window of insulin sensitivity.</v>

2884
01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:29.800
<v Speaker 7>So I do believe that one technology,</v>

2885
01:12:29.801 --> 01:12:29.951
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

2886
01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:30.190
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2887
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:31.270
<v Speaker 7>what while we're on the sleep thing,</v>

2888
01:12:31.271 --> 01:12:32.680
<v Speaker 7>one that we were utilizing for Henry,</v>

2889
01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.250
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2890
01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:36.490
<v Speaker 7>just little light microcurrent here to your temporal lobes and it's proven to</v>

2891
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.970
<v Speaker 7>increase serotonin and Melatonin and decreased cortisol.</v>

2892
01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:43.720
<v Speaker 7>So we're like manipulating biochemicals and it's a very natural way of making</v>

2893
01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:44.650
<v Speaker 7>you feel drowsy.</v>

2894
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:45.950
<v Speaker 7>What time do you do that up?</v>

2895
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:49.660
<v Speaker 7>We would do that immediately following every rigorous training session to kind</v>

2896
01:12:49.661 --> 01:12:52.450
<v Speaker 7>of like negate inflammatory responses and things like that.</v>

2897
01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:55.540
<v Speaker 7>And I'll get you back into that anabolic phase as quickly as possible.</v>

2898
01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.310
<v Speaker 7>And then ideally right before bed,</v>

2899
01:12:57.311 --> 01:12:58.144
<v Speaker 7>every single night.</v>

2900
01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.590
<v Speaker 7>Did you feel like a science project?</v>

2901
01:12:59.591 --> 01:12:59.800
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2902
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.730
<v Speaker 7>this shit was going on.</v>

2903
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Did I did actually they did a presentation on me and,</v>

2904
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.450
<v Speaker 5>and Russia with Roman,</v>

2905
01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.170
<v Speaker 5>with the,</v>

2906
01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:07.520
<v Speaker 5>with the scientists at the habit,</v>

2907
01:13:07.521 --> 01:13:08.600
<v Speaker 5>they use p I like,</v>

2908
01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 5>they tracked everything according to the Omegawave,</v>

2909
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:12.260
<v Speaker 5>the device that we're using.</v>

2910
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:14.060
<v Speaker 5>And he was able to kind of show it was I,</v>

2911
01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:14.894
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>

2912
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:16.800
<v Speaker 5>my system might,</v>

2913
01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2914
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.650
<v Speaker 5>this system does work.</v>

2915
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2916
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.320
<v Speaker 5>it's just like people were kind of just tripping out.</v>

2917
01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:21.920
<v Speaker 5>So I was,</v>

2918
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.641
<v Speaker 5>I went out there,</v>

2919
01:13:22.641 --> 01:13:26.290
<v Speaker 5>did the whole presentation with a at Moscow and the,</v>

2920
01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.590
<v Speaker 5>everybody was just kind of just like,</v>

2921
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.880
<v Speaker 5>everybody was kind of like,</v>

2922
01:13:28.881 --> 01:13:29.510
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2923
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

2924
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Someone works kind of scratching their head and a little like,</v>

2925
01:13:31.971 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

2926
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.520
<v Speaker 5>that's that.</v>

2927
01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:34.363
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

2928
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:38.330
<v Speaker 5>You're able to kind of see how I peaked for this fight and how I was able to</v>

2929
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.560
<v Speaker 5>kind of survive fibroids.</v>

2930
01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.400
<v Speaker 5>The Russians</v>

2931
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.700
<v Speaker 4>really been pioneering this type of training for quite a while.</v>

2932
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.670
<v Speaker 4>Specifically the,</v>

2933
01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:50.420
<v Speaker 4>the type of training like that Pavel tot saline uses,</v>

2934
01:13:50.421 --> 01:13:53.030
<v Speaker 4>like where you're using way less energy,</v>

2935
01:13:53.031 --> 01:13:54.440
<v Speaker 4>you're working out way less,</v>

2936
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:56.660
<v Speaker 4>but you're getting better results from it.</v>

2937
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:57.351
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>

2938
01:13:57.351 --> 01:14:01.910
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of thought processes that have been leaning in this direction from</v>

2939
01:14:01.911 --> 01:14:01.971
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2940
01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:04.790
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of really high level top coaches for quite a while now.</v>

2941
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:05.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2942
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:05.740
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2943
01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:09.060
<v Speaker 5>and it's cool to see it cause I come from a traditional sport where you put your</v>

2944
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 5>head down and you'd go,</v>

2945
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.630
<v Speaker 5>that's how fast rustling and more tight.</v>

2946
01:14:12.631 --> 01:14:13.451
<v Speaker 5>I think they're very,</v>

2947
01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:14.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2948
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 5>they're very alike in that sense.</v>

2949
01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.091
<v Speaker 5>I could,</v>

2950
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 5>they're very traditional.</v>

2951
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 5>Like the harder you go,</v>

2952
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.660
<v Speaker 5>the more you push through injury,</v>

2953
01:14:19.661 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2954
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:20.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2955
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:21.610
<v Speaker 5>the better you will become.</v>

2956
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I also think that there's something to be said for that though in terms of</v>

2958
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:30.230
<v Speaker 4>mental strength because one of the things that wrestlers have that is,</v>

2959
01:14:30.231 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 4>it's not just that they have a great skill and being able to manipulate bodies,</v>

2960
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 4>but they also have mental toughness.</v>

2961
01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 4>That's at a level that I don't think you get from any other sport.</v>

2962
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think there's a lot of pro athletes,</v>

2963
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 4>even tennis players that are just mentally tough.</v>

2964
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 4>They're just tough so people just know how to win.</v>

2965
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 4>They know how to push themselves,</v>

2966
01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:52.000
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like wrestlers are on another level cause they're always tired.</v>

2967
01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.620
<v Speaker 4>They're always overtrained,</v>

2968
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.190
<v Speaker 4>they're always dehydrated and they're always working out with a bunch of fucking</v>

2969
01:14:57.191 --> 01:14:58.024
<v Speaker 4>savages.</v>

2970
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:01.870
<v Speaker 4>They're all the same way and everybody takes pleasure in being miserable.</v>

2971
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 4>There's something to that that like you see it,</v>

2972
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.191
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2973
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I've seen thousands of fights.</v>

2974
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:12.130
<v Speaker 4>You see there's something about wrestlers they have just like an extra gear,</v>

2975
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.420
<v Speaker 4>like a high level wrestler in particular has an extra gear that a lot of other</v>

2976
01:15:16.421 --> 01:15:18.130
<v Speaker 4>fighters just never developed.</v>

2977
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:18.961
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2978
01:15:18.961 --> 01:15:19.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2979
01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.210
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like I tell people wrestling's not,</v>

2980
01:15:21.211 --> 01:15:22.910
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like not a sport man.</v>

2981
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like a culture.</v>

2982
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:24.900
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2983
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're just,</v>

2984
01:15:26.101 --> 01:15:26.271
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2985
01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:28.830
<v Speaker 5>you're in the culture of rustling and once you have that,</v>

2986
01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:29.664
<v Speaker 5>it's almost,</v>

2987
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.960
<v Speaker 5>there's an honor to it.</v>

2988
01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:32.760
<v Speaker 5>There's a warrior to it and like,</v>

2989
01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:33.594
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

2990
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:34.870
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2991
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:35.460
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2992
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:35.631
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2993
01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:36.000
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2994
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.580
<v Speaker 5>I was just at the world championship,</v>

2995
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Joe and I can tell you,</v>

2996
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:39.691
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2997
01:15:39.691 --> 01:15:41.580
<v Speaker 5>the best athletes in the world,</v>

2998
01:15:41.581 --> 01:15:42.420
<v Speaker 5>I was just in Budapest,</v>

2999
01:15:42.421 --> 01:15:45.150
<v Speaker 5>Hungary and I saw Kyle Snyder and all these guys compete.</v>

3000
01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.261
<v Speaker 5>And I'm just like,</v>

3001
01:15:46.261 --> 01:15:46.681
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3002
01:15:46.681 --> 01:15:47.400
<v Speaker 5>these are the most,</v>

3003
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.130
<v Speaker 5>these are the best athletes in the world.</v>

3004
01:15:49.131 --> 01:15:51.540
<v Speaker 5>This is the hardest shit a human being could ever do.</v>

3005
01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.130
<v Speaker 5>If you're to see the finesse and the strength and the power and what's involved</v>

3006
01:15:56.131 --> 01:15:59.700
<v Speaker 5>in becoming a world champion of watching these guys go through this freaking</v>

3007
01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:00.271
<v Speaker 5>tucks.</v>

3008
01:16:00.271 --> 01:16:01.350
<v Speaker 5>Just a tough,</v>

3009
01:16:01.351 --> 01:16:02.610
<v Speaker 5>the toughest tournament in the world.</v>

3010
01:16:02.611 --> 01:16:04.590
<v Speaker 5>And it's a,</v>

3011
01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:05.371
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3012
01:16:05.371 --> 01:16:08.640
<v Speaker 5>I think what we do in a minute is fun compared to a competitor wrestling.</v>

3013
01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.420
<v Speaker 5>I really do like that stuff is like,</v>

3014
01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:16.170
<v Speaker 5>man that stuff is hard with these guys go through win a tournament.</v>

3015
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.330
<v Speaker 5>Like it's the weight cuts,</v>

3016
01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:18.840
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3017
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3018
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.940
<v Speaker 5>they don't get paid a lot of money.</v>

3019
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 5>Like these dudes are literally Alpha,</v>

3020
01:16:23.231 --> 01:16:25.260
<v Speaker 5>the Gloria all each and every one of them.</v>

3021
01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.240
<v Speaker 4>It's all glory.</v>

3022
01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.860
<v Speaker 4>There's no financial reward at all.</v>

3023
01:16:27.861 --> 01:16:29.510
<v Speaker 4>That's what's fascinating about it.</v>

3024
01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 4>But it's just interesting to me that I think you kind of need both in some weird</v>

3025
01:16:36.021 --> 01:16:36.650
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3026
01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Your mind needs to develop this,</v>

3027
01:16:39.211 --> 01:16:43.730
<v Speaker 4>this layer of toughness that wrestlers have and then I think once you've</v>

3028
01:16:43.731 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 4>developed that then maybe I think your approach Kevin is,</v>

3029
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:49.970
<v Speaker 4>is like applicable.</v>

3030
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 4>But I think that until an athlete has that indomitable spirit until they have</v>

3031
01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:58.970
<v Speaker 4>that sort of that iron will that a wrestler possesses,</v>

3032
01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.610
<v Speaker 4>it's theirs to make a champion.</v>

3033
01:17:01.611 --> 01:17:02.510
<v Speaker 4>I think you need many,</v>

3034
01:17:02.511 --> 01:17:03.380
<v Speaker 4>many things,</v>

3035
01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.121
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

3036
01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:08.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can ever discount that ability to work through discomfort the</v>

3037
01:17:08.061 --> 01:17:09.050
<v Speaker 4>way wrestlers have.</v>

3038
01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.430
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think it's wise as a professional athlete at a championship level</v>

3039
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 4>to compete compromised.</v>

3040
01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:15.391
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3041
01:17:15.391 --> 01:17:15.840
<v Speaker 5>agreed.</v>

3042
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3043
01:17:16.021 --> 01:17:16.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3044
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:16.581
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3045
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:17.640
<v Speaker 5>there's the intangibles,</v>

3046
01:17:17.641 --> 01:17:19.020
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that you just can't teach,</v>

3047
01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:20.340
<v Speaker 5>you can't quantify,</v>

3048
01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:20.910
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3049
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:23.460
<v Speaker 5>So what we do our best to quantify as much as we can,</v>

3050
01:17:23.461 --> 01:17:23.880
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

3051
01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean I completely agree.</v>

3052
01:17:25.231 --> 01:17:25.680
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

3053
01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.740
<v Speaker 5>you got to put in the time and the work to learn the skill at some point and</v>

3054
01:17:28.741 --> 01:17:29.860
<v Speaker 5>then once you know it,</v>

3055
01:17:29.861 --> 01:17:30.571
<v Speaker 5>it's autonomic.</v>

3056
01:17:30.571 --> 01:17:31.301
<v Speaker 5>The skills master,</v>

3057
01:17:31.301 --> 01:17:33.540
<v Speaker 5>that's when you can kind of kick it back into order method.</v>

3058
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:33.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna,</v>

3059
01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:35.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna agree with you Joe.</v>

3060
01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.210
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to agree with you.</v>

3061
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.140
<v Speaker 5>And I think the reason why this works for pretty much every MMA fighters because</v>

3062
01:17:40.141 --> 01:17:41.310
<v Speaker 5>we've all been through hell.</v>

3063
01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3064
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:45.600
<v Speaker 5>Like an order for you to see an end believe in science is you have to go through</v>

3065
01:17:45.601 --> 01:17:46.590
<v Speaker 5>how to understand like,</v>

3066
01:17:46.591 --> 01:17:46.951
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

3067
01:17:46.951 --> 01:17:48.960
<v Speaker 5>the hard way probably isn't the best way.</v>

3068
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:51.330
<v Speaker 4>But when you were talking about your,</v>

3069
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:52.543
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3070
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.880
<v Speaker 4>the feeling that you had in not wanting to ever feel the pain of losing again,</v>

3071
01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.460
<v Speaker 4>that feeling that you had when your ankle is going out and that they'd be like,</v>

3072
01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:03.061
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

3073
01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:03.241
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3074
01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:03.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3075
01:18:03.391 --> 01:18:03.750
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3076
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:04.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing this.</v>

3077
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find a way out of this.</v>

3078
01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Like you almost have to experience lows in order to have that.</v>

3079
01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:12.171
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

3080
01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:17.171
<v Speaker 4>I feel like one of the things about wrestling that makes it a sport that creates</v>

3081
01:18:17.491 --> 01:18:22.491
<v Speaker 4>so many fucking savages is because you go through so much shit,</v>

3082
01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.930
<v Speaker 4>so much hardship,</v>

3083
01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:25.650
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3084
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:28.260
<v Speaker 4>so much difficulty that you know,</v>

3085
01:18:28.261 --> 01:18:33.261
<v Speaker 4>if you had science based wrestling programs the way you're doing a science based</v>

3086
01:18:33.331 --> 01:18:35.500
<v Speaker 4>camp and you went in and you know,</v>

3087
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.091
<v Speaker 4>said everybody,</v>

3088
01:18:36.091 --> 01:18:36.900
<v Speaker 4>you got to slow down,</v>

3089
01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.441
<v Speaker 4>slow down.</v>

3090
01:18:37.441 --> 01:18:38.274
<v Speaker 4>You know like you,</v>

3091
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:39.540
<v Speaker 4>you're going too hard,</v>

3092
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:40.261
<v Speaker 4>slow down,</v>

3093
01:18:40.261 --> 01:18:41.430
<v Speaker 4>can't run up hills today.</v>

3094
01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:41.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3095
01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3096
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.430
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3097
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:45.780
<v Speaker 4>your DC brain waves or a wrestling coach would be like,</v>

3098
01:18:45.781 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up and sit to,</v>

3099
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.050
<v Speaker 4>who is this asshole give Dan Gable brought you in a camp and you guys are</v>

3100
01:18:52.051 --> 01:18:53.310
<v Speaker 4>running around doing all this stuff.</v>

3101
01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:53.701
<v Speaker 4>He'd be like,</v>

3102
01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:54.420
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3103
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:54.601
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3104
01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:55.434
<v Speaker 4>what are you saying?</v>

3105
01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Like this is how we make champions.</v>

3106
01:18:57.170 --> 01:18:57.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3107
01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:57.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3108
01:18:57.911 --> 01:18:59.050
<v Speaker 5>But like I said,</v>

3109
01:18:59.051 --> 01:19:00.250
<v Speaker 5>I think you hit the nail on the head.</v>

3110
01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:01.300
<v Speaker 5>I think it's for,</v>

3111
01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:01.841
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>

3112
01:19:01.841 --> 01:19:02.980
<v Speaker 5>the way I would see it as like,</v>

3113
01:19:02.981 --> 01:19:04.510
<v Speaker 5>you have to kind of go through how a,</v>

3114
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:07.630
<v Speaker 5>that understanding because you had to go through that callus through that burn.</v>

3115
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:08.890
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like,</v>

3116
01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:10.000
<v Speaker 5>especially in MMA,</v>

3117
01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.610
<v Speaker 5>a lot of athletes or even athletes just in general,</v>

3118
01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3119
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.890
<v Speaker 5>everybody buses or butts on what's,</v>

3120
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:15.880
<v Speaker 5>if you're an elite athlete,</v>

3121
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:16.710
<v Speaker 5>like you'll,</v>

3122
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:17.431
<v Speaker 5>you'll always train,</v>

3123
01:19:17.431 --> 01:19:18.790
<v Speaker 5>maybe not the smartest way.</v>

3124
01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:19.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3125
01:19:19.841 --> 01:19:20.674
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3126
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:21.580
<v Speaker 5>like it's,</v>

3127
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.413
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3128
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.170
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3129
01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:25.120
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could add more to,</v>

3130
01:19:25.121 --> 01:19:25.920
<v Speaker 5>to your training or,</v>

3131
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.081
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

3132
01:19:26.081 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

3133
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:26.680
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

3134
01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:26.920
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

3135
01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.120
<v Speaker 5>or take away less if there's a,</v>

3136
01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.700
<v Speaker 5>but there's a fine line to it.</v>

3137
01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 4>Do you have the fine line is what's fascinating to me?</v>

3138
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3139
01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3140
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3141
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things that I love about MMA is that it's so broad.</v>

3142
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:42.881
<v Speaker 4>There are so many skills that the approach to success is different with every</v>

3143
01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:44.331
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

3144
01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 4>And you have to find what that approach is like the approach to you for your,</v>

3145
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 4>for you,</v>

3146
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 4>for you to achieve success is going to be different than the approach for a</v>

3147
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:53.421
<v Speaker 4>different athlete.</v>

3148
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

3149
01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:55.490
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have the same skills that you have,</v>

3150
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 4>but like Anderson Silva,</v>

3151
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:58.250
<v Speaker 4>perfect example,</v>

3152
01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.113
<v Speaker 4>he's not a wrestler.</v>

3153
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.080
<v Speaker 4>It's going to have a different,</v>

3154
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.490
<v Speaker 4>different approach.</v>

3155
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

3156
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.120
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be different things that they work on and training,</v>

3157
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a different mindset.</v>

3158
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 4>It's going to a different way of preparing.</v>

3159
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:08.821
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3160
01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:09.091
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3161
01:20:09.091 --> 01:20:09.231
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3162
01:20:09.231 --> 01:20:09.411
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3163
01:20:09.411 --> 01:20:11.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's all according to everybody according like not,</v>

3164
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:12.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3165
01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of things are cookie cutter.</v>

3166
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Like looking at it the way now,</v>

3167
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:19.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like a lot of things have have stayed even in wrestling,</v>

3168
01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 1>like just over tradition,</v>

3169
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:22.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3170
01:20:22.411 --> 01:20:23.041
<v Speaker 1>like bridging,</v>

3171
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>like every time I see you,</v>

3172
01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:26.180
<v Speaker 1>but bridge and the way they stretched and they're gonna be like,</v>

3173
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:28.520
<v Speaker 1>do that shit so bad for you.</v>

3174
01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And then that'd be doing like these like springs on their head.</v>

3175
01:20:31.651 --> 01:20:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

3176
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>

3177
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:33.390
<v Speaker 1>how bad,</v>

3178
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 1>how bad is bridging for you?</v>

3179
01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:35.341
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3180
01:20:35.341 --> 01:20:35.621
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3181
01:20:35.621 --> 01:20:35.741
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3182
01:20:35.741 --> 01:20:36.820
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

3183
01:20:36.821 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3184
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:37.650
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3185
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:38.020
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

3186
01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.240
<v Speaker 7>but Mike Tyson always looked bad ass and he's doing it.</v>

3187
01:20:40.241 --> 01:20:41.770
<v Speaker 7>But I was going to say it looks pretty bad ass.</v>

3188
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:42.663
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3189
01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.593
<v Speaker 7>teacher,</v>

3190
01:20:43.690 --> 01:20:44.430
<v Speaker 7>have you ever</v>

3191
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:47.130
<v Speaker 1>thrown with the iron neck with the iron neck?</v>

3192
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:47.993
<v Speaker 1>We don't know about that.</v>

3193
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:48.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3194
01:20:48.351 --> 01:20:49.184
<v Speaker 1>I got one.</v>

3195
01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:50.690
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3196
01:20:50.690 --> 01:20:52.480
<v Speaker 7>gotta try this and sell some of your videos.</v>

3197
01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:53.710
<v Speaker 7>That's definitely one of the missing links.</v>

3198
01:20:53.711 --> 01:20:54.940
<v Speaker 7>Why a lot of these wrestlers get hurt.</v>

3199
01:20:54.941 --> 01:20:55.120
<v Speaker 7>Then,</v>

3200
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:55.420
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3201
01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.150
<v Speaker 7>neck and stability,</v>

3202
01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:59.620
<v Speaker 7>the postural issues that had come associated with it as well as guys need to</v>

3203
01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:00.490
<v Speaker 7>strengthen their necks.</v>

3204
01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.361
<v Speaker 1>It's a halo.</v>

3205
01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You put it on,</v>

3206
01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 1>you pump it up like a Reebok pump.</v>

3207
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Reebok pump,</v>

3208
01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you pump this sucker up so it tightens up on your head.</v>

3209
01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.970
<v Speaker 1>You put a chin strap on,</v>

3210
01:21:09.971 --> 01:21:14.020
<v Speaker 1>it's got a bungee cable on that's set to 50 pounds back up.</v>

3211
01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.130
<v Speaker 1>And then there's resistance on the halo so it spins the resist.</v>

3212
01:21:18.131 --> 01:21:22.210
<v Speaker 1>The Halo has like you could tighten up our clamp down or loosen up the</v>

3213
01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>resistance and you do these exercises.</v>

3214
01:21:24.101 --> 01:21:24.934
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

3215
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.730
<v Speaker 1>he goes sideways.</v>

3216
01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:28.390
<v Speaker 1>You do like,</v>

3217
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:29.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3218
01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.640
<v Speaker 1>like loops back and forth.</v>

3219
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3220
01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:31.930
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking bad ass.</v>

3221
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.293
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3222
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited man.</v>

3223
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

3224
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:36.191
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3225
01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:38.320
<v Speaker 7>you got to trust that why sign that waiver is that</v>

3226
01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:44.190
<v Speaker 7>you signed a waiver because we got to get ahold of some of that weed while</v>

3227
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:46.540
<v Speaker 7>you're running through walls and all the</v>

3228
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.480
<v Speaker 7>in the float tank if you want to try the food because the waivers for two,</v>

3229
01:21:52.481 --> 01:21:53.380
<v Speaker 7>I don't want you to lose your mind.</v>

3230
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:53.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3231
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.400
<v Speaker 7>The sensory immersion that let's float tanks,</v>

3232
01:21:55.401 --> 01:21:56.111
<v Speaker 7>they're pretty bad ass.</v>

3233
01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:58.930
<v Speaker 7>We studied those quite a bit for the nervous system based stuff where we're</v>

3234
01:21:58.931 --> 01:22:00.610
<v Speaker 7>building kind of our own sensory immersion,</v>

3235
01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:02.590
<v Speaker 7>like mindfulness room of the future as well.</v>

3236
01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.300
<v Speaker 7>All the walls led screens.</v>

3237
01:22:04.301 --> 01:22:06.610
<v Speaker 7>So you could put yourself fully immersed in any environment.</v>

3238
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.660
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be pretty bad ass mindfulness is so overlooked in these sports.</v>

3239
01:22:10.661 --> 01:22:11.494
<v Speaker 7>How important,</v>

3240
01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:12.121
<v Speaker 7>and I know you're,</v>

3241
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:13.390
<v Speaker 7>you're a meditation guy as well.</v>

3242
01:22:13.391 --> 01:22:13.770
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3243
01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:13.961
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3244
01:22:13.961 --> 01:22:15.010
<v Speaker 7>get getting your mind right.</v>

3245
01:22:15.011 --> 01:22:15.170
<v Speaker 7>Is,</v>

3246
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.570
<v Speaker 7>is invaluable.</v>

3247
01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.021
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3248
01:22:17.021 --> 01:22:17.840
<v Speaker 7>And you were saying that you</v>

3249
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.850
<v Speaker 1>meditation and Yoga is also a part of the preparation that you guys employ.</v>

3250
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:22.211
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3251
01:22:22.211 --> 01:22:23.200
<v Speaker 7>100% yeah.</v>

3252
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.610
<v Speaker 7>I mean it all comes down to,</v>

3253
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:27.760
<v Speaker 7>you know when we're doing our warm up training and recovery,</v>

3254
01:22:27.761 --> 01:22:29.020
<v Speaker 7>it's all mind and body.</v>

3255
01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.920
<v Speaker 7>So his warmup is going to include like Somata sensory reaction testing.</v>

3256
01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:35.620
<v Speaker 7>So imagine like a a wall and it has different lights on it.</v>

3257
01:22:35.621 --> 01:22:36.850
<v Speaker 7>You were act as quickly as you can.</v>

3258
01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.710
<v Speaker 7>As soon as they light up and I say all right,</v>

3259
01:22:38.711 --> 01:22:39.850
<v Speaker 7>if the light comes up red,</v>

3260
01:22:39.851 --> 01:22:41.080
<v Speaker 7>use your right hand and blue,</v>

3261
01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:41.980
<v Speaker 7>use your left hand.</v>

3262
01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:45.760
<v Speaker 7>So we're invoking cognitive decision making processes that we need to have.</v>

3263
01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:47.020
<v Speaker 7>You stand on one of these shake plates,</v>

3264
01:22:47.021 --> 01:22:48.340
<v Speaker 7>appropriate receptive plate.</v>

3265
01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.360
<v Speaker 7>Now your vision,</v>

3266
01:22:49.361 --> 01:22:50.230
<v Speaker 7>your neuromuscular,</v>

3267
01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.130
<v Speaker 7>your appropriate receptive,</v>

3268
01:22:51.131 --> 01:22:52.060
<v Speaker 7>everything is warmed up.</v>

3269
01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:52.571
<v Speaker 7>Everything,</v>

3270
01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:54.220
<v Speaker 7>every part of your brain that's going to equate to,</v>

3271
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:54.611
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3272
01:22:54.611 --> 01:22:55.391
<v Speaker 7>force output,</v>

3273
01:22:55.391 --> 01:22:56.560
<v Speaker 7>absorption and so on.</v>

3274
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:58.630
<v Speaker 7>Then we go do a more traditional warmup,</v>

3275
01:22:58.690 --> 01:22:59.710
<v Speaker 7>whatever that may be.</v>

3276
01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:01.480
<v Speaker 7>We do a cognitive training,</v>

3277
01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:03.850
<v Speaker 7>we do physical training more from a functional aspect.</v>

3278
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.930
<v Speaker 7>And then as soon as you're done,</v>

3279
01:23:04.931 --> 01:23:07.270
<v Speaker 7>we you into a mine based recovery as well.</v>

3280
01:23:07.271 --> 01:23:10.300
<v Speaker 7>So we get you into yoga meditation that you know,</v>

3281
01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:13.470
<v Speaker 7>technology we're playing with right now that manipulates your biochemicals.</v>

3282
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:13.960
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3283
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.141
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3284
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:15.430
<v Speaker 7>just just about everything man.</v>

3285
01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 7>It's mind and body every step along the way.</v>

3286
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.940
<v Speaker 4>And when you're doing yoga,</v>

3287
01:23:18.941 --> 01:23:21.400
<v Speaker 4>you're doing yoga to increase mobility.</v>

3288
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing it for the mental training?</v>

3289
01:23:23.861 --> 01:23:24.521
<v Speaker 4>For both?</v>

3290
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:25.050
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3291
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:25.640
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3292
01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.700
<v Speaker 7>definitely a little bit of both.</v>

3293
01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:29.370
<v Speaker 7>We believe I'm Andre more leads that the yoga what,</v>

3294
01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:30.061
<v Speaker 7>what we're doing over there.</v>

3295
01:23:30.061 --> 01:23:31.740
<v Speaker 7>So He'd be better to ask specifically,</v>

3296
01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:34.560
<v Speaker 7>but we believe it largely for nervous system and for breathing.</v>

3297
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:34.910
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3298
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:37.830
<v Speaker 7>one thing we really talked about is the diaphragmatic breathing and yoga is</v>

3299
01:23:37.831 --> 01:23:40.590
<v Speaker 7>really a calm environment to be able to focus on your breathing.</v>

3300
01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.101
<v Speaker 7>What does that mean?</v>

3301
01:23:41.101 --> 01:23:43.040
<v Speaker 7>Diaphragmatic breathing?</v>

3302
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:43.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3303
01:23:43.290 --> 01:23:44.360
<v Speaker 7>breathing from your diaphragm.</v>

3304
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:45.300
<v Speaker 7>This is how we're all born.</v>

3305
01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:46.740
<v Speaker 7>Breathing from our diaphragm and just,</v>

3306
01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.370
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3307
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:48.960
<v Speaker 7>eventually we ended up breathing from our chest,</v>

3308
01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:52.110
<v Speaker 7>which is very ineffective for metabolic efficiency.</v>

3309
01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:52.944
<v Speaker 7>And Jennifer,</v>

3310
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.160
<v Speaker 7>just like when you see like the Wim Hoff Guy,</v>

3311
01:23:56.161 --> 01:24:00.180
<v Speaker 7>he's what was breathing from his gut here and that's like engaging your core as</v>

3312
01:24:00.181 --> 01:24:01.500
<v Speaker 7>opposed to just like your chest.</v>

3313
01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:03.300
<v Speaker 7>So you're actually getting deeper breaths.</v>

3314
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:06.120
<v Speaker 7>You're encouraging like core stability and things as well.</v>

3315
01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.980
<v Speaker 7>It's better for metabolic efficiency.</v>

3316
01:24:07.981 --> 01:24:12.000
<v Speaker 7>So when you're actually exercising it's better for delaying anaerobic threshold,</v>

3317
01:24:12.001 --> 01:24:13.020
<v Speaker 7>buffering lactate,</v>

3318
01:24:13.021 --> 01:24:16.290
<v Speaker 7>things like that as well as keeping the nervous system calm as well.</v>

3319
01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's any benefit to breathing through your nose and out through</v>

3320
01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:19.410
<v Speaker 4>your mouth?</v>

3321
01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:20.243
<v Speaker 4>Or is that,</v>

3322
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:20.970
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3323
01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3324
01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:22.203
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3325
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.120
<v Speaker 7>I'd say it's an on an individualized basis.</v>

3326
01:24:24.121 --> 01:24:24.840
<v Speaker 7>I think if it,</v>

3327
01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.330
<v Speaker 7>the best thing is to not think about your breathing when you start thinking</v>

3328
01:24:27.331 --> 01:24:27.601
<v Speaker 7>about it,</v>

3329
01:24:27.601 --> 01:24:28.740
<v Speaker 7>it can kind of get fucked up.</v>

3330
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.580
<v Speaker 7>So if we encourage diaphragmatic breathing without this,</v>

3331
01:24:31.581 --> 01:24:33.300
<v Speaker 7>this technology we utilize is actually,</v>

3332
01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.340
<v Speaker 7>even though when you're utilizing the technology,</v>

3333
01:24:35.341 --> 01:24:37.650
<v Speaker 7>you're just breathing in and out through your mouth,</v>

3334
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.480
<v Speaker 7>it actually encourages in through the nose,</v>

3335
01:24:39.481 --> 01:24:40.770
<v Speaker 7>out through the mouth when you're training.</v>

3336
01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.301
<v Speaker 7>So I'm,</v>

3337
01:24:41.301 --> 01:24:43.170
<v Speaker 7>I mean I'm not an expert specifically on that,</v>

3338
01:24:43.171 --> 01:24:43.860
<v Speaker 7>but it sounds,</v>

3339
01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.071
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3340
01:24:44.071 --> 01:24:46.350
<v Speaker 7>I think there's definitely some performance advantage to it.</v>

3341
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3342
01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:47.431
<v Speaker 7>I want to talk to him.</v>

3343
01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:48.181
<v Speaker 7>He may know Joe.</v>

3344
01:24:48.181 --> 01:24:48.870
<v Speaker 7>Thank you Kevin.</v>

3345
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 7>I appreciate him and this guy will,</v>

3346
01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:50.680
<v Speaker 7>he goes,</v>

3352
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:58.720
<v Speaker 4>but where they could find out about your company and what your website is.</v>

3353
01:24:58.920 --> 01:24:59.370
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3354
01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:00.540
<v Speaker 7>our company's in Scottsdale,</v>

3355
01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:01.230
<v Speaker 7>Arizona.</v>

3356
01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:04.440
<v Speaker 7>The website is neuro force one o n e.com.</v>

3357
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:05.460
<v Speaker 7>Check us out.</v>

3358
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:05.821
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>

3359
01:25:05.821 --> 01:25:06.180
<v Speaker 7>thank you.</v>

3360
01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:06.640
<v Speaker 7>Thanks chef.</v>

3361
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 6>Those are very informative,</v>

3362
01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.480
<v Speaker 6>intense shit.</v>

3363
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.910
<v Speaker 6>Son Henry is now become the standard because uh,</v>

3364
01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:17.520
<v Speaker 6>like he said that a Roman for the performance institute debt did that PowerPoint</v>

3365
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.510
<v Speaker 6>presentation for UFC Moscow.</v>

3366
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 6>He told us he's the first athlete that ever did eight weeks that they have eight</v>

3367
01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.910
<v Speaker 6>weeks collection of data.</v>

3368
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:30.210
<v Speaker 6>So Henry's now become the standard of the system that a Roman had newer force</v>

3369
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:34.870
<v Speaker 6>one and all the data put together as the first time ever that an athlete</v>

3370
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:37.390
<v Speaker 6>actually stuck to the program for eight weeks.</v>

3371
01:25:37.391 --> 01:25:38.224
<v Speaker 6>That's fantastic.</v>

3372
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 4>So for you now you got the title and there is talk about you fighting for the</v>

3373
01:25:44.901 --> 01:25:47.570
<v Speaker 4>bantamweight title against champion Tj Dillashaw.</v>

3374
01:25:47.571 --> 01:25:48.404
<v Speaker 4>What are your thoughts?</v>

3375
01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Where are you at right now?</v>

3376
01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you,</v>

3377
01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:50.960
<v Speaker 4>what are your goals?</v>

3378
01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.110
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

3379
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:53.490
<v Speaker 7>it's a beautiful town of [inaudible] to be the champ.</v>

3380
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:56.540
<v Speaker 7>There's a,</v>

3381
01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:56.850
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

3382
01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:58.710
<v Speaker 7>there's tons of tons of options.</v>

3383
01:25:58.711 --> 01:25:59.280
<v Speaker 7>Joe,</v>

3384
01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.750
<v Speaker 7>where's your contract out right now?</v>

3385
01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:01.880
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3386
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.240
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3387
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:02.671
<v Speaker 7>I have,</v>

3388
01:26:02.671 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 7>I still about seven fights</v>

3389
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:04.720
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

3390
01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3391
01:26:05.061 --> 01:26:05.241
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3392
01:26:05.241 --> 01:26:05.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3393
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm under,</v>

3394
01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3395
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to renegotiate because I think more than likely that TG five might</v>

3396
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.693
<v Speaker 1>might happen.</v>

3397
01:26:11.410 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Gonna happen that TG fight might happen if,</v>

3398
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3399
01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.330
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to be a dumb with,</v>

3400
01:26:15.331 --> 01:26:15.830
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

3401
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:16.970
<v Speaker 1>with the flyweight division.</v>

3402
01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:18.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3403
01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the cat's out the bag and you know,</v>

3404
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have had mentioned that to me,</v>

3405
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:22.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3406
01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:22.431
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3407
01:26:22.431 --> 01:26:22.611
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3408
01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:22.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3409
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:23.370
<v Speaker 1>we were going,</v>

3410
01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:25.180
<v Speaker 1>we want to take you up on that offer a view,</v>

3411
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:27.320
<v Speaker 1>a challenging to go up against Tj,</v>

3412
01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:28.173
<v Speaker 1>but this is what,</v>

3413
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.230
<v Speaker 1>this is where the company's been thinking about for awhile and teachers down for</v>

3414
01:26:33.231 --> 01:26:34.064
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

3415
01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:34.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3416
01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I think TJ wants to come down to 25 I think.</v>

3417
01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's Kinda like the,</v>

3418
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:41.330
<v Speaker 1>like the delay a little bit.</v>

3419
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3420
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3421
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.890
<v Speaker 1>would you rather fight him at 35 so you can get an additional title or would you</v>

3422
01:26:45.891 --> 01:26:49.280
<v Speaker 1>rather fight him at 35 because you don't have to cut weight or what's your head?</v>

3423
01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3424
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I like both ideas.</v>

3425
01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I actually kind of left it off to him.</v>

3426
01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:52.791
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3427
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:52.941
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

3428
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:53.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3429
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but I want to fight you,</v>

3430
01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:54.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3431
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:54.771
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3432
01:26:54.771 --> 01:26:55.521
<v Speaker 1>I wanna fight Tj.</v>

3433
01:26:55.521 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

3434
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to go out to the next best thing.</v>

3435
01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3436
01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that's him,</v>

3437
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3438
01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.460
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind fighting for 25 or 35 yeah,</v>

3439
01:27:01.461 --> 01:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3440
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:02.783
<v Speaker 1>that makes it easier.</v>

3441
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3442
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:04.690
<v Speaker 1>that definitely makes sense.</v>

3443
01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:05.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

3444
01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:05.211
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3445
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:05.511
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

3446
01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 1>let's see it at 25 listed at 35,</v>

3447
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:07.611
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

3448
01:27:07.611 --> 01:27:08.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3449
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.990
<v Speaker 1>let's fight man.</v>

3450
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what your,</v>

3451
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.670
<v Speaker 1>your mind is right now.</v>

3452
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:12.140
<v Speaker 1>That's your number one goal.</v>

3453
01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3454
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3455
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And I believe Tj wants to fight me too.</v>

3456
01:27:15.351 --> 01:27:15.741
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3457
01:27:15.741 --> 01:27:16.574
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3458
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:17.301
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3459
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:17.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3460
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:18.201
<v Speaker 1>beating Demetrius,</v>

3461
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I think they kind of,</v>

3462
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that's going to help his name and you know,</v>

3463
01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:21.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3464
01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess for both you can sit,</v>

3465
01:27:23.011 --> 01:27:23.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3466
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:27.710
<v Speaker 1>so now that Demetrius has left the division and gone off to one fc to get</v>

3467
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:33.080
<v Speaker 1>where I'm,</v>

3468
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>where do you think the division is right now?</v>

3469
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3470
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3471
01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:37.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3472
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:38.000
<v Speaker 1>is that one reason,</v>

3473
01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 1>like if you won at 35 and one of the title 35,</v>

3474
01:27:41.391 --> 01:27:45.530
<v Speaker 1>would you consider dropping the 25 pound title and competing at 35 or would you</v>

3475
01:27:45.531 --> 01:27:46.820
<v Speaker 1>rather stay at 25?</v>

3476
01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3477
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:48.591
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

3478
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind.</v>

3479
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind dabbling in both.</v>

3480
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:50.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3481
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:51.591
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a,</v>

3482
01:27:51.591 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda,</v>

3483
01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.061
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of broad,</v>

3484
01:27:53.061 --> 01:27:54.620
<v Speaker 1>but I won't point.</v>

3485
01:27:54.621 --> 01:27:58.020
<v Speaker 1>You do get tired of cutting weight and I'm kind of a,</v>

3486
01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:58.460
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

3487
01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 1>right now I'm probably about probably about 50,</v>

3488
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.520
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>

3489
01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't wonder,</v>

3490
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3491
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.030
<v Speaker 1>losing 15 pounds is way better than losing 25 pounds.</v>

3492
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3493
01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3494
01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:09.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3495
01:28:09.611 --> 01:28:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3496
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little,</v>

3497
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bigger now,</v>

3498
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:12.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3499
01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:12.831
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

3500
01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:14.060
<v Speaker 1>because of that reason I might,</v>

3501
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I might have to fight at a bad time,</v>

3502
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.760
<v Speaker 1>so I'm kind of a,</v>

3503
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:19.003
<v Speaker 1>I think more like him,</v>

3504
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.410
<v Speaker 1>it might happen at bat him away.</v>

3505
01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:26.440
<v Speaker 6>What people don't know is that actually Henry almost fought TJ when he was the</v>

3506
01:28:26.441 --> 01:28:30.010
<v Speaker 6>champ when Hannah Borow didn't make weight his first fight in the UFC.</v>

3507
01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.031
<v Speaker 6>He didn't make weight.</v>

3508
01:28:31.031 --> 01:28:33.220
<v Speaker 6>But two hours later Hanan Barao didn't make,</v>

3509
01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.400
<v Speaker 6>make weight and they were looking for somebody to go up and fight TJ when Joe</v>

3510
01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.220
<v Speaker 6>Soto Fordham [inaudible] was the number one option.</v>

3511
01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.090
<v Speaker 6>But Henry had already declined.</v>

3512
01:28:46.091 --> 01:28:46.360
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3513
01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.070
<v Speaker 6>he said he wasn't fighting Jorgensen and,</v>

3514
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:52.750
<v Speaker 6>but now here we are three years later back now he's got the tent,</v>

3515
01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:54.160
<v Speaker 6>he's got the belt.</v>

3516
01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:57.910
<v Speaker 6>Tj came back and won the belt was do it.</v>

3517
01:28:57.911 --> 01:28:59.650
<v Speaker 6>These guys been beefing for uh,</v>

3518
01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:00.851
<v Speaker 6>for a long time.</v>

3519
01:29:00.851 --> 01:29:04.140
<v Speaker 6>So ever since the first day he came into the UFC,</v>

3520
01:29:04.141 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 6>him and Tj have been added.</v>

3521
01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 6>And then on the ultimate fighter,</v>

3522
01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 6>ultimate fighter 24,</v>

3523
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 6>they had a Duane bang was the coach.</v>

3524
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:13.950
<v Speaker 6>There was like a little beef with Henry and,</v>

3525
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3526
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:17.550
<v Speaker 6>Benevidez his team Benevidez his coach.</v>

3527
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 6>So it Kinda goes way back</v>

3528
01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:21.410
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3529
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:23.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a bit of animosity to,</v>

3530
01:29:23.061 --> 01:29:23.894
<v Speaker 2>on top of everything.</v>

3531
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Now you are very goal oriented guy.</v>

3532
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

3533
01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:27.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3534
01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:30.980
<v Speaker 4>do you have your career mapped out in terms of like when you would like to get</v>

3535
01:29:30.981 --> 01:29:31.814
<v Speaker 4>out of the game?</v>

3536
01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh my do.</v>

3537
01:29:33.261 --> 01:29:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I do and I think about it a lot cause man,</v>

3538
01:29:34.851 --> 01:29:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3539
01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest with you Joe,</v>

3540
01:29:36.201 --> 01:29:36.501
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3541
01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:37.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3542
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I've accomplished everything I've ever wanted to,</v>

3543
01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:40.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3544
01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.300
<v Speaker 2>and in my career,</v>

3545
01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.051
<v Speaker 2>like I've always,</v>

3546
01:29:42.051 --> 01:29:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

3547
01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I had three goals and I was just,</v>

3548
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:44.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3549
01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:46.890
<v Speaker 2>my number one goal was just to be a good person,</v>

3550
01:29:46.891 --> 01:29:48.500
<v Speaker 2>that good father and a good husband.</v>

3551
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:51.110
<v Speaker 2>And then after that we'll say being an Olympic champ and then,</v>

3552
01:29:51.111 --> 01:29:51.620
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

3553
01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:52.990
<v Speaker 2>and then eventually UFC champs.</v>

3554
01:29:52.991 --> 01:29:53.870
<v Speaker 2>So everything's kind of,</v>

3555
01:29:53.871 --> 01:29:54.704
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3556
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3557
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:55.761
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3558
01:29:55.761 --> 01:29:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I've done everything in that I've ever kind of set my mind to,</v>

3559
01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3560
01:30:00.710 --> 01:30:01.900
<v Speaker 2>those are the two biggest things,</v>

3561
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:03.980
<v Speaker 2>the two magnets to get anybody to get everything.</v>

3562
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:05.361
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3563
01:30:05.361 --> 01:30:06.194
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3564
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3565
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't see myself fighting for more than for more than maybe three to four</v>

3566
01:30:09.921 --> 01:30:10.754
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3567
01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.290
<v Speaker 2>The only collagen woods,</v>

3568
01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:17.260
<v Speaker 4>you really are in this rare space where you have the possibility of being</v>

3569
01:30:17.261 --> 01:30:20.380
<v Speaker 4>considered one of the greatest combat sport athletes of all time when you're</v>

3570
01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:21.250
<v Speaker 4>already in the mix.</v>

3571
01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:21.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3572
01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.690
<v Speaker 4>The Olympic gold medalist,</v>

3573
01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.310
<v Speaker 4>UFC champion.</v>

3574
01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:25.091

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3578
01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I think for the most part,</v>

3579
01:30:33.681 --> 01:30:33.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3580
01:30:33.831 --> 01:30:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I like to eventually,</v>

3581
01:30:35.031 --> 01:30:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3582
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of motivational speaking.</v>

3583
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3584

3586
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:43.100
<v Speaker 2>the biggest companies in the world.</v>

3587
01:30:43.101 --> 01:30:43.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3588
01:30:43.341 --> 01:30:44.210
<v Speaker 2>the Coca Cola,</v>

3589
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.710
<v Speaker 2>like the TD Ameritrade,</v>

3590
01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:46.941
<v Speaker 2>Procter and gamble,</v>

3591
01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:47.800
<v Speaker 2>your billion dollar come.</v>

3592
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I just got soundbite Kroger.</v>

3593
01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3594
01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:50.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3595
01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:50.910
<v Speaker 2>and they kind of,</v>

3596
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:51.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3597
01:30:51.231 --> 01:30:51.971
<v Speaker 2>they use me for,</v>

3598
01:30:51.971 --> 01:30:52.970
<v Speaker 2>for that reason.</v>

3599
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed doing that.</v>

3600
01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:55.993
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3601
01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:58.070
<v Speaker 2>and plus you get put off of a book page</v>

3602
01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.700
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to get leg kicked.</v>

3603
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3604
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3605
01:31:02.341 --> 01:31:06.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to get leg kick and hit that nerve and do the drunken monkey.</v>

3606
01:31:06.111 --> 01:31:06.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3607
01:31:06.441 --> 01:31:08.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't gotta do all that and it's just cool.</v>

3608
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:10.100
<v Speaker 2>It just call to kind of share the,</v>

3609
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:10.341
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3610
01:31:10.341 --> 01:31:10.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3611
01:31:10.581 --> 01:31:11.900
<v Speaker 2>the whole underdog story.</v>

3612
01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I love that people do do that.</v>

3613
01:31:13.711 --> 01:31:14.970
<v Speaker 4>The companies have the,</v>

3614
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:15.833
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3615
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.040
<v Speaker 4>the mindset of bringing in champions and people that are extraordinary or</v>

3616
01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:20.791
<v Speaker 4>whatever they do,</v>

3617
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:22.110
<v Speaker 4>and speaking to these,</v>

3618
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3619
01:31:22.891 --> 01:31:24.840
<v Speaker 4>these people that work for them and explaining like,</v>

3620
01:31:24.841 --> 01:31:25.171
<v Speaker 4>what did,</v>

3621
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean that motivation is gigantic.</v>

3622
01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Motivation is such a huge source of fuel for people in all walks of life.</v>

3623
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:34.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3624
01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:37.290
<v Speaker 4>to have a guy like you come in and talk to a company could have a really big</v>

3625
01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 4>impact on their creativity on,</v>

3626
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.090
<v Speaker 4>on how they pursue goals on all kinds,</v>

3627
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.470
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of different fit things.</v>

3628
01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:44.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3629
01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:44.731
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

3630
01:31:44.731 --> 01:31:45.070
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3631
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.731
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

3632
01:31:45.731 --> 01:31:46.750
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of where I kind of,</v>

3633
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I can see my life kind of heading to now.</v>

3634
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I know eventually I don't think I can,</v>

3635
01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

3636
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll always be a fan of the sport,</v>

3637
01:31:52.601 --> 01:31:56.890
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I'll be involved in either rustling or fighters as much as I</v>

3638
01:31:56.891 --> 01:31:57.690
<v Speaker 2>think I would</v>

3639
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:58.770
<v Speaker 4>not as a coach.</v>

3640
01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.633
<v Speaker 4>Not as,</v>

3641
01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.260
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3642
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:01.380
<v Speaker 5>it's too hard Joe.</v>

3643
01:32:01.381 --> 01:32:01.621
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3644
01:32:01.621 --> 01:32:02.940
<v Speaker 5>look at all these because these coaches,</v>

3645
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:04.650
<v Speaker 5>it's a two relationship.</v>

3646
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3647
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.500
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3648
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.510
<v Speaker 5>being a coach is you're,</v>

3649
01:32:06.511 --> 01:32:07.660
<v Speaker 5>you're in a relationship with,</v>

3650
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:07.861
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3651
01:32:07.861 --> 01:32:08.551
<v Speaker 5>with your athletes.</v>

3652
01:32:08.551 --> 01:32:12.240
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you go through these breakups and sometimes the athletes don't give</v>

3653
01:32:12.241 --> 01:32:14.010
<v Speaker 5>you what they want to give you and then it's just a,</v>

3654
01:32:14.011 --> 01:32:15.300
<v Speaker 5>it's a headache at times.</v>

3655
01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:15.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3656
01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:16.463
<v Speaker 5>And they see that with,</v>

3657
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:17.760
<v Speaker 5>I see that with a lot of,</v>

3658
01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:18.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3659
01:32:18.481 --> 01:32:19.800
<v Speaker 5>I see that with him and I'm just like,</v>

3660
01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:19.981
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3661
01:32:19.981 --> 01:32:21.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I want those stress level.</v>

3662
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:24.061
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3663
01:32:24.061 --> 01:32:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Eric,</v>

3664
01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.640
<v Speaker 4>for a guy like you,</v>

3665
01:32:25.641 --> 01:32:25.920
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3666
01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.260
<v Speaker 4>you get across a guy like Henry,</v>

3667
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:29.700
<v Speaker 4>you hit the gold mine,</v>

3668
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:34.890
<v Speaker 4>but you could get across the guy who is a really talented guy that's a flake.</v>

3669
01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:36.090
<v Speaker 4>And those two,</v>

3670
01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.260
<v Speaker 4>to me personally,</v>

3671
01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:38.610
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of those.</v>

3672
01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.530
<v Speaker 4>But to me as an analyst,</v>

3673
01:32:40.710 --> 01:32:42.060
<v Speaker 4>as someone to watch his fights there,</v>

3674
01:32:42.061 --> 01:32:45.120
<v Speaker 4>the most frustrating because there's some guys that I see and I'll go,</v>

3675
01:32:45.121 --> 01:32:45.751
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

3676
01:32:45.751 --> 01:32:46.770
<v Speaker 4>that motherfucker is good.</v>

3677
01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.210
<v Speaker 4>And he's got to potential.</v>

3678
01:32:48.211 --> 01:32:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Like they can do things inside the octagon.</v>

3679
01:32:50.191 --> 01:32:52.620
<v Speaker 4>They do things like I'll see guys in the gym,</v>

3680
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.800
<v Speaker 4>like I'll go to a gym and watch guys train and see the guy and I go,</v>

3681
01:32:55.801 --> 01:32:59.790
<v Speaker 4>if this motherfucker could put it together like this in the cage,</v>

3682
01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.100
<v Speaker 4>the way you see when he's sparring.</v>

3683
01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Like some people are just artists,</v>

3684
01:33:04.530 --> 01:33:08.260
<v Speaker 4>but the anxiety of competition and,</v>

3685
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:11.430
<v Speaker 4>and all the factors that come involve the discipline,</v>

3686
01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:12.750
<v Speaker 4>the consistency,</v>

3687
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:16.170
<v Speaker 4>all the things that make someone a great fight or sometimes there's so much,</v>

3688
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:19.560
<v Speaker 4>so many different things that make someone a great fight or that at wind up</v>

3689
01:33:19.561 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 4>fucking them up when when they,</v>

3690
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:25.560
<v Speaker 4>they actually go to compete though the recklessness and impulsiveness that</v>

3691
01:33:25.561 --> 01:33:30.561
<v Speaker 4>actually makes them good also can wind up tanking them if they don't sort of</v>

3692
01:33:30.931 --> 01:33:31.860
<v Speaker 4>forge it with,</v>

3693
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.430
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

3694
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:34.200
<v Speaker 4>with some sort of like severe disease</v>

3695
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.920
<v Speaker 5>plan.</v>

3696
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3697
01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:35.370
<v Speaker 5>There,</v>

3698
01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:38.090
<v Speaker 5>there has to be a training of the mind too.</v>

3699
01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.380
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's where people are skipping.</v>

3700
01:33:41.190 --> 01:33:42.120
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3701
01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:42.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3702
01:33:42.781 --> 01:33:43.511
<v Speaker 5>I think that's,</v>

3703
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:47.220
<v Speaker 5>that's where you had to understand like the philosophy appeared like you have</v>

3704
01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:48.054
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

3705
01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.890
<v Speaker 5>you have to be right up top.</v>

3706
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:52.500
<v Speaker 5>You have no right to be yet to be literally,</v>

3707
01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:55.710
<v Speaker 5>you have to understand and know who you are as a fighter,</v>

3708
01:33:55.711 --> 01:33:56.544
<v Speaker 5>as a person.</v>

3709
01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:57.953
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3710
01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:58.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3711
01:33:58.321 --> 01:33:59.450
<v Speaker 5>to kind of,</v>

3712
01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.400
<v Speaker 5>to be stable enough to perform at,</v>

3713
01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:02.600
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3714
01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:02.880
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

3715
01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.080
<v Speaker 5>when it really matters,</v>

3716
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:05.190
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3717
01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:05.890
<v Speaker 5>And if,</v>

3718
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:06.691
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have that,</v>

3719
01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:09.810
<v Speaker 5>you can be as talented and as gifted as you want,</v>

3720
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.000
<v Speaker 5>you'll,</v>

3721
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.180
<v Speaker 5>you'll never make it.</v>

3722
01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3723
01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.400
<v Speaker 5>And then we'll see those all the time.</v>

3724
01:34:14.401 --> 01:34:15.870
<v Speaker 5>Like I'd see guys in practice mad,</v>

3725
01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.450
<v Speaker 5>they would tear me up and they came to a competition.</v>

3726
01:34:18.451 --> 01:34:20.550
<v Speaker 5>There was just a rollover rollover like fish.</v>

3727
01:34:20.551 --> 01:34:21.121
<v Speaker 5>It's weird,</v>

3728
01:34:21.121 --> 01:34:21.670
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3729
01:34:21.670 --> 01:34:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3730
01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:22.411
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3731
01:34:22.411 --> 01:34:22.681
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3732
01:34:22.681 --> 01:34:23.514
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

3733
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3734
01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:24.661
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

3735
01:34:24.661 --> 01:34:27.600
<v Speaker 4>As you're coming up and you see those guys and you're,</v>

3736
01:34:27.601 --> 01:34:28.590
<v Speaker 4>you realize like,</v>

3737
01:34:28.591 --> 01:34:28.891
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3738
01:34:28.891 --> 01:34:29.190
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3739
01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:30.930
<v Speaker 4>there's something missing and then you,</v>

3740
01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.290
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3741
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:31.800
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3742
01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.551
<v Speaker 4>you're terrified.</v>

3743
01:34:32.551 --> 01:34:33.780
<v Speaker 4>You're going to see that in yourself.</v>

3744
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:38.710
<v Speaker 5>In ethic is the embracement of embracing pressure is something that you don't</v>

3745
01:34:38.711 --> 01:34:42.190
<v Speaker 5>neglect or sometimes she don't shy away from something that you don't allow them</v>

3746
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:43.270
<v Speaker 5>to damage you,</v>

3747
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 5>but it's an embracement.</v>

3748
01:34:44.710 --> 01:34:45.000
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

3749
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:45.670
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

3750
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:45.911
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3751
01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:46.541
<v Speaker 5>bring it man.</v>

3752
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:46.901
<v Speaker 5>Bring me,</v>

3753
01:34:46.901 --> 01:34:47.800
<v Speaker 5>cause that's what it is,</v>

3754
01:34:47.801 --> 01:34:48.050
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

3755
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 5>It's the pressure that people feel,</v>

3756
01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:50.860
<v Speaker 5>the reason why they can't perform.</v>

3757
01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.080
<v Speaker 4>It's what makes champions.</v>

3758
01:34:52.081 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I remember when Tj Dillashaw first fought Hanan Barao um,</v>

3759
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.910
<v Speaker 4>when he got into that octagon,</v>

3760
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 4>he looked like he was born,</v>

3761
01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 1>he was loose as a goose.</v>

3762
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.621
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3763
01:35:00.621 --> 01:35:01.251
<v Speaker 1>and I saw him,</v>

3764
01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:01.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3765
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:01.971
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

3766
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>look how loose TJ is.</v>

3767
01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a world title fight.</v>

3768
01:35:05.290 --> 01:35:08.900
<v Speaker 1>And he's switching stances and giving them looks and he looks fantastic.</v>

3769
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 1>He just looked loose and then boom,</v>

3770
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.840
<v Speaker 1>he hits him with that big overhand right.</v>

3771
01:35:12.841 --> 01:35:13.491
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

3772
01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Henry Morales getting fucked up.</v>

3773
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3774
01:35:15.901 --> 01:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>and that was what TJ thrives on.</v>

3775
01:35:18.861 --> 01:35:19.641
<v Speaker 1>That kind of pressure.</v>

3776
01:35:19.641 --> 01:35:22.250
<v Speaker 1>He lives for that kind of pressure just like you do,</v>

3777
01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:23.530
<v Speaker 1>which is why I want to,</v>

3778
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.433
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3779
01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.581
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

3780
01:35:26.581 --> 01:35:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I want his head on the,</v>

3781
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to say I went to his head on a spike.</v>

3782
01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I wanna make,</v>

3783
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I wanna make some snake shoes out of</v>

3784
01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.190
<v Speaker 1>snakeskin snake skin shoes,</v>

3785
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:41.080
<v Speaker 1>navy suit.</v>

3786
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I think he might be big enough for me.</v>

3787
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what a fight that would be for fans too.</v>

3788
01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's those champion versus champion encounters are always so fantastic.</v>

3789
01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:49.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3790
01:35:49.501 --> 01:35:52.700
<v Speaker 1>and the reason why it's cool too is because we're both in our prime to like,</v>

3791
01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Tj is probably a couple of years older than me.</v>

3792
01:35:54.231 --> 01:35:55.670
<v Speaker 1>But even when like the matress like dude,</v>

3793
01:35:55.671 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd be Demetrius in his prime.</v>

3794
01:35:56.991 --> 01:35:57.411
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

3795
01:35:57.411 --> 01:35:58.370
<v Speaker 1>it was a close fight.</v>

3796
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.910
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

3797
01:35:59.910 --> 01:36:00.621
<v Speaker 1>I can say,</v>

3798
01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:00.991
<v Speaker 1>did I,</v>

3799
01:36:00.991 --> 01:36:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I beat him in his prime in this prime.</v>

3800
01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there's no doubt.</v>

3801
01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:04.791
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

3802
01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it was because of the game plan.</v>

3803
01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And then you ended the greatest winning streak in the history of the sport.</v>

3804
01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3805
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3806
01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Rich Championship defense streak in the history of the sport.</v>

3807
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:15.710
<v Speaker 1>And then on top,</v>

3808
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean number good.</v>

3809
01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Madoff has the greatest winning streak in the sport because he's,</v>

3810
01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3811
01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.390
<v Speaker 1>still undefeated.</v>

3812
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:22.790
<v Speaker 1>But as far as defending the title,</v>

3813
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Dj was number one.</v>

3814
01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3815
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 1>you did it to him in his prime.</v>

3816
01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:29.180
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way he destroyed Wilson Hayes,</v>

3817
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.320
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like,</v>

3818
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean fucking give it just everybody.</v>

3819
01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:34.454
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3820
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.960
<v Speaker 1>everybody just,</v>

3821
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.880
<v Speaker 1>he's a monster,</v>

3822
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:37.580
<v Speaker 1>a Borg,</v>

3823
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.670
<v Speaker 1>the greatest submission.</v>

3824
01:36:38.671 --> 01:36:41.540
<v Speaker 1>And that was his three shit of all time.</v>

3825
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 1>We fucking suplexes him and it catches an arm bar on the way down.</v>

3826
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

3827
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.160
<v Speaker 1>They told me he does that and training all the time.</v>

3828
01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:50.581
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3829
01:36:50.581 --> 01:36:52.400
<v Speaker 6>Matt Hume is a wizard a,</v>

3830
01:36:52.401 --> 01:36:52.800
<v Speaker 6>where's it?</v>

3831
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.550
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that I did that was kind of unconventional,</v>

3832
01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.210
<v Speaker 6>unconventional for this camp.</v>

3833
01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:59.010
<v Speaker 6>I had them video at it.</v>

3834
01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.860
<v Speaker 6>We obviously we scouted Demetrius Johnson,</v>

3835
01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:06.000
<v Speaker 6>but then I went back and got every one minute clip of Matt Hume's,</v>

3836
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:07.143
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3837
01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:07.740
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3838
01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:09.300
<v Speaker 6>interval between rounds.</v>

3839
01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:11.130
<v Speaker 6>So 25 fights.</v>

3840
01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:15.450
<v Speaker 6>I have the one minute what he tells him how he adapts and changes.</v>

3841
01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:19.440
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things I noticed is that he always went to wrestling and he went,</v>

3842
01:37:19.441 --> 01:37:20.490
<v Speaker 6>he always went to wrestling.</v>

3843
01:37:20.491 --> 01:37:21.960
<v Speaker 6>He sounded like it was automatic.</v>

3844
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:22.591
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

3845
01:37:22.591 --> 01:37:24.480
<v Speaker 6>so this round we're going to take him down and we're going to work.</v>

3846
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:27.600
<v Speaker 6>It was always automatic and when it went into the fifth round,</v>

3847
01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:29.250
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't automatic.</v>

3848
01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:30.330
<v Speaker 6>You can hear him say,</v>

3849
01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:32.970
<v Speaker 6>you could try to take them down if you want.</v>

3850
01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.080
<v Speaker 6>It was kind of like that,</v>

3851
01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:34.950
<v Speaker 6>the way he said it.</v>

3852
01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.230
<v Speaker 6>And when I went back and watched and I was like,</v>

3853
01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.213
<v Speaker 6>we got him.</v>

3854
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.671
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3855
01:37:38.671 --> 01:37:38.790
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3856
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:40.350
<v Speaker 6>going into that fifth round,</v>

3857
01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:44.100
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that we talked about subliminally and mentally,</v>

3858
01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:44.730
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3859
01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:46.980
<v Speaker 6>training was when we went,</v>

3860
01:37:46.981 --> 01:37:48.750
<v Speaker 6>Henry was just putting the hall of fame,</v>

3861
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:49.241
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3862
01:37:49.241 --> 01:37:49.470
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3863
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:52.980
<v Speaker 6>which has never been done at such a young age as a wrestler,</v>

3864
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:53.903
<v Speaker 6>as a wrestler.</v>

3865
01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 6>And when was at the wrestling hall of fame,</v>

3866
01:37:56.281 --> 01:37:56.950
<v Speaker 6>Nate car,</v>

3867
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:59.580
<v Speaker 6>who's also one of the greatest Russell's ever,</v>

3868
01:37:59.581 --> 01:38:00.414
<v Speaker 6>he told me,</v>

3869
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:01.021
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

3870
01:38:01.021 --> 01:38:01.501
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

3871
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:02.334
<v Speaker 6>Eric,</v>

3872
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:06.150
<v Speaker 6>when I wrestled Kenny Monday and I lost him in the big tents,</v>

3873
01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 6>I knew that when I went out two weeks later to fight him in the Ncaa finals,</v>

3874
01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:13.470
<v Speaker 6>that it might come up that,</v>

3875
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3876
01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:14.731
<v Speaker 6>that band,</v>

3877
01:38:14.731 --> 01:38:15.780
<v Speaker 6>this guy just beat me.</v>

3878
01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:16.681
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>

3879
01:38:16.681 --> 01:38:17.580
<v Speaker 6>so I had a book,</v>

3880
01:38:17.581 --> 01:38:17.821
<v Speaker 6>actually,</v>

3881
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:19.470
<v Speaker 6>I think he said his wife made his book.</v>

3882
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:20.431
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3883
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:22.760
<v Speaker 6>and he put all the positive things that,</v>

3884
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.401
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3885
01:38:23.401 --> 01:38:23.820
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3886
01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 6>made car had done and all the articles,</v>

3887
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 6>and she made quotes from that and put it in this book.</v>

3888
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:31.080
<v Speaker 6>So he gave me that idea and then I did that.</v>

3889
01:38:31.081 --> 01:38:33.780
<v Speaker 6>So when Henry was putting in the hall of fame that night,</v>

3890
01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:35.100
<v Speaker 6>they had a video highlights.</v>

3891
01:38:35.101 --> 01:38:36.720
<v Speaker 6>It had Terry brands is coach.</v>

3892
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:38.280
<v Speaker 6>They had a circuit.</v>

3893
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.690
<v Speaker 6>Bella,</v>

3894
01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 6>I've Kenny,</v>

3895
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 6>Kevin Jackson,</v>

3896
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.520
<v Speaker 6>some of the greatest,</v>

3897
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:46.320
<v Speaker 6>all his coaches saying stuff about him when I took that and I put it in his book</v>

3898
01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.000
<v Speaker 6>and it kind of like when I read it to him every day and they kind like,</v>

3899
01:38:51.001 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3900
01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:52.770
<v Speaker 6>happened in the fight.</v>

3901
01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:54.360
<v Speaker 6>One of the pieces are own quotes would said,</v>

3902
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 6>I've got to go in there and kill and be ready to die.</v>

3903
01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:57.990
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3904
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.411
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3905
01:38:58.411 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 6>when he got that leg injury,</v>

3906
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3907
01:39:01.231 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 6>he was ready to die.</v>

3908
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:03.690
<v Speaker 6>He was ready to keep going forward.</v>

3909
01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:04.201
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3910
01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:06.120
<v Speaker 6>we adapted and it went south pole.</v>

3911
01:39:06.121 --> 01:39:06.870
<v Speaker 6>But I'll,</v>

3912
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 6>some of that stuff from the book came exactly true.</v>

3913
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:11.330
<v Speaker 6>Start fast and,</v>

3914
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 6>and finish even stronger,</v>

3915
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:16.140
<v Speaker 6>compete with passion and a purpose.</v>

3916
01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:21.090
<v Speaker 6>And this was when I said to him right here and the fifth day to show you this</v>

3917
01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:22.681
<v Speaker 6>does,</v>

01:39:22.681 --> 01:39:24.960
<v Speaker 6>this is what I told him going into the fifth round,</v>

3919
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.470
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3920
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:26.310
<v Speaker 6>when we was forward,</v>

3921
01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:27.380
<v Speaker 6>let's see the two,</v>

3922
01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:28.820
<v Speaker 6>let's see that's here.</v>

3923
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:29.581
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

3924
01:39:29.581 --> 01:39:31.290
<v Speaker 6>let me say as said less throw Henry,</v>

3925
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:32.640
<v Speaker 6>burn the ships,</v>

3926
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:34.440
<v Speaker 6>take the fucking castle,</v>

3927
01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 6>let's take him down.</v>

3928
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.890
<v Speaker 6>Hurt him on the ground.</v>

3929
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.030
<v Speaker 6>If he gets back up,</v>

3930
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 6>knock cause it has out.</v>

3931
01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:42.670
<v Speaker 6>And that's what I told him going into the fifth round,</v>

3932
01:39:42.671 --> 01:39:43.504
<v Speaker 6>the Shaker.</v>

3933
01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:44.460
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

3934
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.110
<v Speaker 6>I've actually only had one or two,</v>

3935
01:39:46.111 --> 01:39:47.760
<v Speaker 6>but we should say the Messenger.</v>

3936
01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:48.571
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3937
01:39:48.571 --> 01:39:49.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3938
01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:49.441
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3939
01:39:49.441 --> 01:39:50.220
<v Speaker 6>it's just uh,</v>

3940
01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.670
<v Speaker 6>something that I was ingrained into them every uh,</v>

3941
01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:54.810
<v Speaker 6>every sparring session.</v>

3942
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:56.280
<v Speaker 6>I had something set for him.</v>

3943
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:59.910
<v Speaker 6>But this time going into the fifth round against Dj,</v>

3944
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:03.720
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't sure if it was two to two or if he needed a knockout.</v>

3945
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:04.583
<v Speaker 6>Did you feel,</v>

3946
01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:06.180
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was two to two.</v>

3947
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.890
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was two to two.</v>

3948
01:40:07.891 --> 01:40:08.371
<v Speaker 6>And I think,</v>

3949
01:40:08.371 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3950
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.730
<v Speaker 6>I think Dj from the interviews that I've heard,</v>

3951
01:40:11.731 --> 01:40:13.770
<v Speaker 6>I think he felt like it was too to going into the fifth year.</v>

3952
01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:16.280
<v Speaker 6>We thought it was too too when we were watching the football boy.</v>

3953
01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:16.560
<v Speaker 6>Damn,</v>

3954
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.970
<v Speaker 6>this is as close as it gets.</v>

3955
01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:18.670
<v Speaker 6>Which makes,</v>

3956
01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:18.870
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3957
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:19.261
<v Speaker 6>And again,</v>

3958
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:19.471
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

3959
01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't,</v>

3960
01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:20.251
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't,</v>

3961
01:40:20.251 --> 01:40:20.931
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

3962
01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:21.220
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3963
01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.930
<v Speaker 6>I it because it was such a close fight.</v>

3964
01:40:22.931 --> 01:40:23.230
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

3965
01:40:23.230 --> 01:40:23.860
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3966
01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:25.720
<v Speaker 6>I had a clap for Demetrius too.</v>

3967
01:40:25.721 --> 01:40:27.070
<v Speaker 6>If they would've gave them though the fight.</v>

3968
01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 6>I know it was close,</v>

3969
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:29.723
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3970
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:30.480
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3971
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.470
<v Speaker 6>what did you weigh?</v>

3972
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:33.180
<v Speaker 6>I was actually,</v>

3973
01:40:33.181 --> 01:40:34.770
<v Speaker 6>I was actually a pound lighter than,</v>

3974
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:35.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3975
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 6>than the beaches.</v>

3976
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:36.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if she knew it.</v>

3977
01:40:36.931 --> 01:40:37.411
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3978
01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:38.244
<v Speaker 6>you look bigger.</v>

3979
01:40:38.610 --> 01:40:39.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3980
01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:39.870
<v Speaker 6>it really did.</v>

3981
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:40.651
<v Speaker 6>But that's again,</v>

3982
01:40:40.651 --> 01:40:40.970
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

3983
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:43.290
<v Speaker 6>that's kind of just one that's kind of where they,</v>

3984
01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.180
<v Speaker 6>the way they placed like my muscle,</v>

3985
01:40:45.181 --> 01:40:46.014
<v Speaker 6>like it was a,</v>

3986
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.540
<v Speaker 6>that's why I look bigger,</v>

3987
01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:50.660
<v Speaker 6>but not always a pound lighter than Demetrius Johnson.</v>

3988
01:40:50.661 --> 01:40:51.271
<v Speaker 6>Didn't you wear at night?</v>

3989
01:40:51.271 --> 01:40:52.200
<v Speaker 6>That one 41.</v>

3990
01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

3991
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.311
<v Speaker 3>This kid's,</v>

3992
01:40:54.311 --> 01:40:55.380
<v Speaker 3>when you sigh,</v>

3993
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:58.320
<v Speaker 3>you guys standing together in the octagon,</v>

3994
01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:00.780
<v Speaker 3>you really did look bigger than him is really interesting.</v>

3995
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:01.703
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3996
01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:02.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3997
01:41:02.071 --> 01:41:02.731
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not,</v>

3998
01:41:02.731 --> 01:41:03.091
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

3999
01:41:03.091 --> 01:41:05.680
<v Speaker 5>I was letting Demetrius people if I die</v>

4000
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 3>and he kept on saying,</v>

4001
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:08.710
<v Speaker 3>he said it twice.</v>

4002
01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:09.371
<v Speaker 3>He's so big.</v>

4003
01:41:09.371 --> 01:41:10.204
<v Speaker 3>He's so strong.</v>

4004
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 3>He said it twice in this post interview,</v>

4005
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 3>but that's wrestling strength,</v>

4006
01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:14.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4007
01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Wrestling's traits.</v>

4008
01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:16.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different kind of strength.</v>

4009
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:17.020
<v Speaker 3>Where did it,</v>

4010
01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.690
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's just not even his strengths and leverage.</v>

4011
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:20.990
<v Speaker 5>Learn how to use,</v>

4012
01:41:20.991 --> 01:41:21.290
<v Speaker 5>how to,</v>

4013
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:23.900
<v Speaker 5>how to tippy toe things and how to use your weight to,</v>

4014
01:41:24.230 --> 01:41:26.150
<v Speaker 5>to pressure opponent or to take them down</v>

4015
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.233
<v Speaker 3>two for sure,</v>

4016
01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but there's also strength strength that wrestlers have.</v>

4017
01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Anybody's ever roll with a or knows that.</v>

4018
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4019
01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:34.311
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

4020
01:41:34.311 --> 01:41:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4021
01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I get to see the transformation that he had from the eight weeks,</v>

4022
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.500
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning to the aunt Ma.</v>

4023
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a documentary.</v>

4024
01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.700
<v Speaker 3>These guys filmed the whole entire thing and you guys are amazing.</v>

4025
01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.090
<v Speaker 3>You're putting the documentary on.</v>

4026
01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:45.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4027
01:41:45.291 --> 01:41:45.831
<v Speaker 5>we're going to put it,</v>

4028
01:41:45.831 --> 01:41:45.950
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4029
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:47.510
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going to put it off sometime in the,</v>

4030
01:41:47.511 --> 01:41:48.560
<v Speaker 5>I think in the spring,</v>

4031
01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:49.890
<v Speaker 5>but it's going to come out in the beginning.</v>

4032
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:50.570
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be,</v>

4033
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:51.210
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be not,</v>

4034
01:41:51.210 --> 01:41:53.180
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going to try to pitch it to a,</v>

4035
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:54.103
<v Speaker 5>to Netflix.</v>

4036
01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:54.973
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

4037
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4038
01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 3>He holds across the Messenger.</v>

4039
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:58.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4040
01:41:58.890 --> 01:41:59.500
<v Speaker 3>The lesson.</v>

4041
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:00.221
<v Speaker 3>And they'll forget,</v>

4042
01:42:00.221 --> 01:42:00.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4043
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.800
<v Speaker 3>as not only was he fighting for the title,</v>

4044
01:42:02.801 --> 01:42:06.190
<v Speaker 3>this guy was fighting for his life only eight months before in the Santa Rosa</v>

4045
01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:06.820
<v Speaker 3>fires.</v>

4046
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.640
<v Speaker 3>So his story is very inspirational.</v>

4047
01:42:08.641 --> 01:42:10.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy fucking story in and of itself.</v>

4048
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:13.060
<v Speaker 3>You actually burn the bottom of your feet running,</v>

4049
01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:15.250
<v Speaker 3>escaping a fire that snuck up on you.</v>

4050
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Like lightning speed,</v>

4051
01:42:16.511 --> 01:42:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

4052
01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4053
01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:17.621
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

4054
01:42:17.621 --> 01:42:18.110
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

4055
01:42:18.110 --> 01:42:21.640
<v Speaker 3>it was the craziest thing that's probably ever happened to me and I've done some</v>

4056
01:42:21.641 --> 01:42:22.510
<v Speaker 3>crazy things.</v>

4057
01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:22.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4058
01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:25.060
<v Speaker 3>They documented it in the UFC pre show,</v>

4059
01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 3>like they showed like all the damage to the area where you were living.</v>

4060
01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:31.000
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking terrifying.</v>

4061
01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:31.351
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4062
01:42:31.351 --> 01:42:32.041
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

4063
01:42:32.041 --> 01:42:32.311
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4064
01:42:32.311 --> 01:42:33.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

4068
01:42:34.651 --> 01:42:35.011
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

4069
01:42:35.011 --> 01:42:37.320
<v Speaker 5>I guess this is where people kind of share their stories,</v>

4070
01:42:37.321 --> 01:42:38.154
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And it was close to about midnight.</v>

4107
01:43:13.110 --> 01:43:13.381
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4108
01:43:13.381 --> 01:43:15.710
<v Speaker 5>I ain't trying to stay up with these people and I'm trying,</v>

4109
01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to sleep cause I was,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I never drink wine.</v>

4111
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:20.040
<v Speaker 5>So I go to my room and uh,</v>

4112
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:21.550

<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4115
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:25.650
<v Speaker 5>I remember right before I went to bed,</v>

4116
01:43:25.651 --> 01:43:28.770
<v Speaker 5>I remember I saw like the flickering of lights and I just,</v>

4117
01:43:28.771 --> 01:43:29.610
<v Speaker 5>I got that it was weird.</v>

4118
01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:31.070
<v Speaker 5>This is roughly about time.</v>

4119
01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:31.890
<v Speaker 5>I got to my hotel,</v>

4120
01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 5>I shout,</v>

4121

<v Speaker 5>I saw the flicker of light side.</v>

4122
01:43:33.411 --> 01:43:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think anything of it.</v>

4123
01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.311
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4124
01:43:36.311 --> 01:43:36.720
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4125
01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.280
<v Speaker 5>I pass out to 30 hits,</v>

4126
01:43:38.281 --> 01:43:39.114
<v Speaker 5>two 30 in the morning,</v>

4127
01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:39.420
<v Speaker 5>head to,</v>

4128
01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:39.931
<v Speaker 5>and I'm just,</v>

4129
01:43:39.931 --> 01:43:40.764
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4130
01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:41.881
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>

4131
01:43:41.881 --> 01:43:42.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4132
01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:44.070
<v Speaker 5>I wake up because I hear the alarm,</v>

4133
01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:44.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4134
01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:45.720
<v Speaker 5>kind of pop off at the,</v>

4135
01:43:45.721 --> 01:43:46.560
<v Speaker 5>at the hotel.</v>

4136
01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:49.320
<v Speaker 5>So now I'm hearing these alarms starting to go off and I've,</v>

4137
01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:49.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4138
01:43:49.921 --> 01:43:50.491
<v Speaker 5>I checked out,</v>

4139
01:43:50.491 --> 01:43:51.324
<v Speaker 5>I checked out on,</v>

4140
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.910
<v Speaker 5>I checked out,</v>

4141
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4142
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:54.110
<v Speaker 5>through the window and I checked out the lobby.</v>

4143
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:54.711
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was moving.</v>

4144
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:55.131
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

4145
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:56.030
<v Speaker 5>it's a false alarm.</v>

4146
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:57.501
<v Speaker 5>So I grabbed the pillow,</v>

4147
01:43:57.501 --> 01:43:59.660
<v Speaker 5>put over my head and every can slept to the alarm.</v>

4148
01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:01.850
<v Speaker 5>That happened about two 30.</v>

4149
01:44:01.851 --> 01:44:03.590
<v Speaker 5>Now four 30 comes about.</v>

4150
01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:04.600
<v Speaker 5>And this time I don't wake up.</v>

4151
01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't wake up because the alarm,</v>

4152
01:44:05.841 --> 01:44:09.130
<v Speaker 5>I wake up because of the smoke and my coffee and I'm,</v>

4153
01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm like coffee on the small and efforts.</v>

4154
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 5>I thought I was dreaming.</v>

4155
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:13.430
<v Speaker 5>So I wake up and I,</v>

4156
01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.360
<v Speaker 5>at that time I had,</v>

4157
01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:14.811
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>

4158
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:15.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4159

01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:16.340
<v Speaker 5>I slept in my town.</v>

4161
01:44:16.341 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 5>That's how tired I was and I got up and I'm going to turn the lights and the</v>

4162
01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:24.030
<v Speaker 5>light tank turning down and then I go through the window and a check the window</v>

4163
01:44:24.031 --> 01:44:24.281
<v Speaker 5>and next,</v>

4164
01:44:24.281 --> 01:44:24.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4165
01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:27.020
<v Speaker 5>and I see the car right in front of me on fire.</v>

4166
01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4167
01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.000
<v Speaker 5>three fourths of the hotels,</v>

4168
01:44:29.001 --> 01:44:31.760
<v Speaker 5>like I was probably about five rooms away from like getting hit hard.</v>

4169
01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm talking about like,</v>

4170
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:35.810
<v Speaker 5>like fire coming out the window and like that.</v>

4171
01:44:35.811 --> 01:44:36.950
<v Speaker 5>And I'm waking up to this,</v>

4172
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.630
<v Speaker 5>like thinking I'm dreaming,</v>

4173
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4174
01:44:39.261 --> 01:44:40.100
<v Speaker 5>in a towel.</v>

4175
01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.533
<v Speaker 5>And then the lights,</v>

4176
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.440
<v Speaker 5>everything was dark,</v>

4177
01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 5>but I could see everything like it.</v>

4178
01:44:43.551 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 5>Like the room started getting hot and I couldn't,</v>

4179
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't hold my breath the more I started looking for my shoes.</v>

4180
01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't find my shoes and I bumped into my slacks that I left them on the</v>

4181
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:55.610
<v Speaker 5>ironing board that the night before and I put them on and I,</v>

4182
01:44:55.611 --> 01:44:56.150
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed,</v>

4183
01:44:56.150 --> 01:44:57.140
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed the,</v>

4184
01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed my phone and I jumped out the window.</v>

4185
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I jumped out the ones that jumped out the wound on my right foot catches on</v>

4186
01:45:03.231 --> 01:45:04.064
<v Speaker 5>fire.</v>

4187
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.001

<v Speaker 5>Foot catches on fire fast and I'm looking to kind of,</v>

4189
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:08.753

<v Speaker 5>real quick.</v>

4193
01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:14.640
<v Speaker 5>Cause my,</v>

4194
01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.980
<v Speaker 5>my right leg was like food.</v>

4195
01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.553
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

4196
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the hotel in front of us was all in sticks to like the whole thing was just in</v>

4199
01:45:25.221 --> 01:45:26.054
<v Speaker 5>sticks.</v>

4200
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.430
<v Speaker 5>Like the fire had just ate that thing up.</v>

4201
01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.440
<v Speaker 5>There's a building in front of me on,</v>

4202
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:31.131
<v Speaker 5>on fire.</v>

4203
01:45:31.131 --> 01:45:31.281
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4204
01:45:31.281 --> 01:45:32.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm just walking through the streets,</v>

4205
01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:33.860
<v Speaker 5>going up the hill and just thinking like,</v>

4206
01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 5>God give me a horrible way to die.</v>

4207
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:38.090
<v Speaker 5>Horrible way to die.</v>

4208
01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.193
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

4209
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.891
<v Speaker 5>And I got to,</v>

4210
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:42.050
<v Speaker 5>I got a bird's eye view when I was on top of the,</v>

4211
01:45:42.051 --> 01:45:42.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4212
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.880
<v Speaker 5>when I was on top of the hill.</v>

4213
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:46.400
<v Speaker 5>And then I saw there as a cop down there,</v>

4214
01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:47.780
<v Speaker 5>there's a cop down,</v>

4215
01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4216
01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.060
<v Speaker 5>and in the middle of the free ones,</v>

4217
01:45:49.061 --> 01:45:51.080
<v Speaker 5>just like we know that's where I got to go.</v>

4218
01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:54.860
<v Speaker 5>So now I'm running fast and I've seen that this brush fire kind of come along</v>

4219
01:45:54.861 --> 01:45:55.190
<v Speaker 5>and just,</v>

4220
01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:56.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing like California,</v>

4221
01:45:56.601 --> 01:45:57.770
<v Speaker 5>like just catch on fire,</v>

4222
01:45:57.771 --> 01:45:59.990
<v Speaker 5>like completely like through my eyes.</v>

4223
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I jump over the first fence to get to the freeway,</v>

4224
01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:03.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4225
01:46:03.531 --> 01:46:04.220
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>

4226
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:06.890
<v Speaker 5>I jump over the second fence and then the third fence,</v>

4227
01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.521
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

4228
01:46:07.521 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 5>it was a very like a flimsy,</v>

4229
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:10.790
<v Speaker 5>a kind of fence.</v>

4230
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.841
<v Speaker 5>And I remember I,</v>

4231
01:46:11.841 --> 01:46:12.440
<v Speaker 5>as I,</v>

4232
01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.150
<v Speaker 5>as I jumped out in British snag,</v>

4233
01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:15.050
<v Speaker 5>like part of my snacks,</v>

4234
01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:15.621
<v Speaker 5>I keep in mind,</v>

4235
01:46:15.621 --> 01:46:16.280
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

4236
01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:16.850
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>

4237
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:18.200
<v Speaker 5>the only thing I had on was slacks.</v>

<v Speaker 5>no shoes,</v>

4241
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:25.160
<v Speaker 5>like out in the cold in California.</v>

4242
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:26.271
<v Speaker 5>And as I,</v>

4243
01:46:26.271 --> 01:46:27.640
<v Speaker 5>that flimsy fence as a,</v>

4244
01:46:27.641 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 5>as I jumped out that last fence,</v>

4245
01:46:29.031 --> 01:46:31.820
<v Speaker 5>it like cut it like a part of the fence.</v>

4246
01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:33.170
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed my butt and it just,</v>

4247
01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.810
<v Speaker 5>it cut me open heart and a tour,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like half the leg.</v>

4249
01:46:36.901 --> 01:46:38.530

<v Speaker 5>Because I was black dude.</v>

4280
01:47:27.671 --> 01:47:27.850
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4281
01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:29.250
<v Speaker 5>I already smelled like a marshmallow.</v>

4282
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:30.660
<v Speaker 5>Did anybody die in the hotel?</v>

4283
01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.200
<v Speaker 5>50 50 50 people died in a,</v>

4284
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:35.090
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

4285
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.923
<v Speaker 5>the whole time.</v>

4286
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:38.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if anybody died at the hotel.</v>

4287
01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:38.970
<v Speaker 5>I hope not.</v>

4288
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:42.150
<v Speaker 5>But I could see how 50 people died in the,</v>

4289
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.480
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4290
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

4291
01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.381
<v Speaker 5>it was a worst.</v>

4292
01:47:43.381 --> 01:47:43.561
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4293
01:47:43.561 --> 01:47:44.700
<v Speaker 5>you have 50 people died.</v>

4294
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:46.520
<v Speaker 5>50 families like it was,</v>

4295
01:47:46.521 --> 01:47:46.810
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

4296
01:47:46.810 --> 01:47:49.080
<v Speaker 5>it was sad to hear what just happened quick.</v>

4297
01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Those fires come so quick.</v>

4298
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:52.920
<v Speaker 5>People don't realize it's before it's too late.</v>

4299
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:54.150
<v Speaker 5>And then there's no escape route.</v>

4300
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:55.780
<v Speaker 5>And I think the reason why it's,</v>

4301
01:47:55.781 --> 01:47:57.180
<v Speaker 5>I think people have time to get out.</v>

4302
01:47:57.181 --> 01:48:00.120
<v Speaker 5>And I think the reason why 50 people dad is because they didn't take the,</v>

4303
01:48:00.121 --> 01:48:00.291
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4304
01:48:00.291 --> 01:48:02.100
<v Speaker 5>the alarm like me serious.</v>

4305
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:04.110
<v Speaker 5>And next you notice this too late because that,</v>

4306
01:48:04.111 --> 01:48:05.490
<v Speaker 5>that smoke will blind you.</v>

4307
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:08.250
<v Speaker 5>So you think you're going to into the right direction and next,</v>

4308
01:48:08.251 --> 01:48:08.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4309
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:10.620
<v Speaker 5>you're walking into the biggest fire in history.</v>

4310
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.820
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

4311
01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:12.890
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4312
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:16.530
<v Speaker 5>so that had happened like two months before I fought Sergio [inaudible] and I,</v>

4313
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.831
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

4314
01:48:16.831 --> 01:48:20.120
<v Speaker 5>and I still fought on like I trained with two socks just with the,</v>

4315
01:48:20.121 --> 01:48:20.461
<v Speaker 5>with the,</v>

4316
01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:23.730
<v Speaker 5>with the wrestling shoe and I just stuck it out because,</v>

4317
01:48:23.731 --> 01:48:24.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4318
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 5>I pulled out the first fight with them.</v>

4319
01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:25.900
<v Speaker 5>I says,</v>

4320
01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:26.200
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4321
01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.270
<v Speaker 5>I gotta make it up to you.</v>

4322
01:48:27.271 --> 01:48:27.871
<v Speaker 5>And I told him,</v>

4323
01:48:27.871 --> 01:48:28.201
<v Speaker 5>I says,</v>

4324
01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:28.351
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4325
01:48:28.351 --> 01:48:28.860

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:29.151

4328
01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:31.050

4329
01:48:31.051 --> 01:48:31.290
