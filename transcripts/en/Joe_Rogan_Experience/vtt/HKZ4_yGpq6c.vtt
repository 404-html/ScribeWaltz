WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Low Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he found guilty before it was</v>

2
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:07.390
<v Speaker 1>revealed that there was these dirty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they and they didn't and they knew that</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>this case existed and they didn't allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the lawyer Ross,</v>

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>his defense was trying to postpone the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trial a couple of months so that the</v>

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>grand jury investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criminal charges they knew were</v>

7
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>going to drop the complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but they were not allowed to postpone</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trial.</v>

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a slam dunk if you can</v>

10
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>prove that these cops are using other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's user names and they were</v>

11
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>hacking into people's accounts and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like right there,</v>

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>like you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't prove anybody that's a trial.</v>

13
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that trial.</v>

14
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Like my perspective on it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm fine with whatever the truth</v>

15
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just love to see both sides have</v>

16
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>their day and I was at that trial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the defense did not have a day.</v>

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>That's always how it is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Mean the idea that you get a fair trial</v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a fucking joke because there's</v>

19
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>so much railroad and going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>because especially when there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda like this to prosecute someone in</v>

21
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

22
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>an important case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a landmark case they think is going to</v>

23
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>establish a precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will fuck you.</v>

24
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Kinda how it is.</v>

25
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will fuck you.</v>

26
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they did to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this dread pirate Roberts character.</v>

27
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dread.</v>

28
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Pirate Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

29
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was accused of being a God they</v>

30
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>think Russell brick just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's denying that he was dread.</v>

31
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Pirate Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

32
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>here's what we know about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that he had these like hardcore</v>

33
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>libertarian values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a hacker.</v>

34
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a computer guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about coding at</v>

35
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

36
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a physics major,</v>

37
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

38
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>he'd put himself through to universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>on full scholarship.</v>

39
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>He had a master's degree in mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering from Penn State.</v>

40
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Very Bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>we know that he had hardcore libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

42
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>We know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He admitted to creating the Silk Road.</v>

43
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>He said he did it to create it like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic stimulation where he would</v>

44
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>combine tour and Bitcoin to allow a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace to exist that would be free</v>

45
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>for everybody to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However they wanted to use it.</v>

46
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>He claims he said he built it with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>help of a lot of other people was he</v>

47
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really know how to code and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let it run.</v>

48
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>And he took off and he was done and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved on and that's what his family,</v>

49
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>his mom and dad back him on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what his family claims given</v>

50
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>being around him because they're a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight knit family.</v>

51
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>All this time they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was not someone who was on his</v>

52
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>laptop all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he could have been</v>

53
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>running a mill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a almost a billion dollar drug empire.</v>

54
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't that guy.</v>

55
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy just sat on his mama's keyboard</v>

56
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>so he claimed he's not dread pirate</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roberts prosecution claimed that he was</v>

58
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was what that first trial was</v>

59
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is there proof that he was a,</v>

60
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>they did find a journal on his laptop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the journal on his laptop is like,</v>

61
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today I'm setting up a dread pirate</v>

62
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Roberts account today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this today.</v>

63
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that fuck writes a journal on their</v>

64
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>laptop of all the shit they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that today I will take over the</v>

65
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of how it was.</v>

66
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>That seems so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

68
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it again would love to see like</v>

69
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I went to the trial thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

70
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>now we're going to see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

71
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>And I would love to see the defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have time to sort of talk through</v>

72
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>their end and have expert witnesses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into the nitty gritty of it because</v>

73
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would say we were the wherever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth lies,</v>

74
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be in the courtroom and to hear</v>

75
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>all that and just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

76
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the most naive,</v>

77
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal mastermind and the history of.</v>

78
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine breaking would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>lasted like wouldn't have lasted half a</v>

79
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>season if they had Walter White light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

80
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So today I will plant a bomb in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>courthouse today.</v>

81
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to blow up that bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This don't tell anyone for law</v>

82
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

83
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he knows a lot about</v>

84
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>computers and computer could be hacked</v>
<v Speaker 2>into or anything.</v>

85
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so stupid.</v>

86
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>So our t just really liked the videos</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was doing and asked me to come</v>

87
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 2>there for an interview and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said there's no way I want to</v>

88
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>move to DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds horrible,</v>

89
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>but I just couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't pass up the opportunity and</v>

90
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>they said that they wanted me to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and just do exactly what I was</v>

91
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 2>doing and just rant and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have an international platform to</v>

92
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

93
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 2>the only hesitation that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I talked to someone who initially</v>

94
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>interviewed me for our tea and I asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

95
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>why do you work here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is Russia today covering things</v>

96
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>that activists care about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is,</v>

97
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 2>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

98
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have to work for the Russian</v>

99
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 2>government to tell the truth about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in my country,</v>

100
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm going to do because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to get the information out there.</v>

101
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>At that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cold War,</v>

102
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Russia was not in the news like</v>
<v Speaker 2>militarily or like this crazy Cold War,</v>

103
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 2>renaissance and resurrection in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like propaganda wars.</v>

104
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So at that time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

105
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the editorial freedom that it gives is</v>

106
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 2>completely unmatched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course people are gonna love you.</v>

107
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gross generalization that</v>

108
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>everything on the networks propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is everything's propaganda.</v>

109
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking thing is propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me one media source that is not</v>

110
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 2>used in some way to push a viewpoint or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bias.</v>

111
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no such thing as neutrality.</v>

112
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone comes with an opinion.</v>

113
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Everyone that comes with a bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd rather know the bias,</v>

114
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>which is Russia today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may not get the truth about Russia</v>

115
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>from going to Russia and watching Russia</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

116
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 2>but you will get the fucking truth about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the U.</v>

117
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 2>s government and you will get the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>about corporations because it's state</v>

118
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 2>funded so you can talk about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things without worrying about</v>

119
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 2>advertisers and sponsorship.</v>

120
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 2>So I always tell people navigate around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bias.</v>

121
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell people that there</v>

122
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>is no bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking stupid.</v>

123
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Of course there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Russia today.</v>

124
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It's fun about the Russian government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of factors that go into</v>

125
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd much rather know that bias</v>

126
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 2>blatantly in front of my face then not</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the tens of thousands of special</v>

127
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>interest and conflicts of interest going</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the entire corporate media</v>

128
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 2>apparatus and all these other agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

129
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 2>and that's even scarier because you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on those channels that had been</v>

130
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 2>fired for criticizing the U.</v>
<v Speaker 2>s government and it's not even state</v>

131
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 2>funded media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just corporate media.</v>

132
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>How long his uncle Paul been around for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

133
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>he started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Paul started is I've</v>

134
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.640
<v Speaker 3>been doing character for years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships long before I did.</v>

135
00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't coin my girlfriends and maybe</v>

136
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 3>he was uncle Larry many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was Roger Davis or Roger d and</v>

137
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 3>this is long before chip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was Roger and Roger had a brother</v>

138
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Lester who was burned in a fire and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

139
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you got a whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all storyline.</v>

140
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Lester was burned everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his knees and his,</v>

141
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 3>he would always wear knickers to show</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

142
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 3>His legs was a whole thing and uncle</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger and uncle,</v>

143
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle Larry and then it merged into chip</v>

144
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Speaker 3>who my girlfriend hated so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chip became the fucking because they</v>

145
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>would chip would embarrass people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did had literally before I ever</v>

146
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 3>thought I'd do on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be out with girlfriends and</v>

147
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 3>embarrass them by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll just be making bad jokes in</v>

148
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 3>the cab and my girlfriend jen and even</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow up and go home and just go,</v>

149
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:50.411
<v Speaker 3>just shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not funny and it made me so happy.</v>

150
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 3>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what Dr Jen crazy.</v>

151
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like a really nice steakhouse</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the waiter would come over and she</v>

152
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 3>would order like the salmon and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>chip just goes.</v>

153
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.430
<v Speaker 3>How much is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And would ask the way there.</v>

154
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know how humiliating it is that</v>

155
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 3>people think I fucked that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think I'm fucking this guy.</v>

156
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's where they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That visceral reaction.</v>

157
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.590
<v Speaker 3>It was real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was who doing one night that she</v>

158
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 3>all I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do it,</v>

159
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:25.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

160
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Edgar's one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do as much because it's bigger.</v>

161
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Edgar's the one with the tiny mouth he</v>
<v Speaker 3>drew</v>

162
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 3>and that's his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he had a brother Eugene and Eugene</v>

163
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 3>was always telling her that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

164
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 3>you need to get right with the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he would always tell her she was</v>

165
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 3>garbage and a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell my girlfriend she was all for</v>

166
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 3>and she was not worthy crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm crying.</v>

167
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:51.231
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

168
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 3>What happened was my girlfriend at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

169
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 3>who's now my best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she might extra offer from years ago.</v>

170
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 3>She hated Eugene so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

171
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even funny anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could we would do it and she would dig</v>

172
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 3>her fingernails into my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She dug her nails into my face because I</v>

173
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 3>think eugene hit a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

174
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

175
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 3>it was such a visceral reaction from her</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I stopped doing eugene because she</v>

176
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 3>caught me dirty texting with another</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

177
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 3>She fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you I wasn't even to go.</v>

178
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I have a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a girl.</v>

179
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I told you my dirty intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a girl.</v>

180
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay you 500 baby.</v>

181
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>So I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm such an addict.</v>

182
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I would save my conversations to jerk</v>
<v Speaker 3>off to,</v>

183
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 3>and I hit the wrong button by button and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking printed it.</v>

184
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking printed it.</v>

185
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 3>So she wakes me up one morning she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim,</v>

186
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 3>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I knew I was in trouble.</v>

187
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 3>So she found these things and she knew I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't fucked the girl,</v>

188
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 3>but it was a real strain on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

189
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 3>So as I swear to you as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as one of the ways of making amends to</v>

190
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped doing eugene.</v>

191
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I killed off Eugene Mellencamp because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

192
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 3>because I do a baby boy character in</v>
<v Speaker 3>jelly who she liked,</v>

193
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.600
<v Speaker 3>who's jelly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do jelly publish to embarrass</v>

194
00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little boy.</v>

195
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.350
<v Speaker 3>But she thought he was really cute and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle Paul would always molest jelly and</v>

196
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 3>fucking and chip was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chipotle is dropped jelly off and uncle</v>

197
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Paul's house and he didn't know it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole fucking inner world.</v>

198
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.840
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chip would be like,</v>

199
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 3>well Ivanka,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul's a good guy.</v>

200
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 3>He's helping out and she is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she would drive her crazy.</v>
