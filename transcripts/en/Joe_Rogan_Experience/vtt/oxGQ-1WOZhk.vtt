00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Who won?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Kalin,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] survivor and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wearing a sky blue shirt please.</v>

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>If I call you terrorist survivor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much hate do you think I'll get?</v>

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a nice green light for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to get upset for no reason.</v>

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that everybody wants to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've not been affected by it,</v>

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want somehow credit.</v>

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I found myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 800 feet exactly away from the</v>

9
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.861
<v Speaker 1>blast because I was at the Gotham Comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Club Two oh eight w I think west 23rd</v>

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>and the volume was at one 33.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to think of how big 800</v>

11
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>feet is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when I'm on my block,</v>

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>half a block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look it on,</v>

13
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually close,</v>

14
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>if you look at on your Google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Av block.</v>

15
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you were about to go on stage.</v>

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I was about to go on stage and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jimmy Burke,</v>

17
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>the national treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Jimmy Burke.</v>

18
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I love Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you do.</v>

19
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking in the front of the</v>

20
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was literally right behind the</v>

21
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>front door and the Gotham comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to walk all the way down and go</v>

22
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>into the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about 25 yards.</v>

24
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>So I'm literally on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with the door in front of us and we</v>

25
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>just hear about boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sickening sound.</v>

26
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:12.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.651
<v Speaker 1>it's a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not a manhole cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

29
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>You just know it's just too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard a bomb.</v>

30
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was 800 feet away before that.</v>

31
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>You did when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I lived in Lebanon.</v>

32
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had,</v>

33
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact I remember going back to</v>

34
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the year,</v>

35
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>but they shot a missile.</v>

36
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It was a test fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a missile over our head on the beach.</v>

37
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I will never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so loud that we fell down on the</v>

38
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were on the beach.</v>

39
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>It was so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that was because it was</v>

40
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>shot over our heads in the sonic boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we fell down.</v>

41
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It May and it was either a shell or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

42
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>But I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't see it though.</v>

43
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shell because it's going so fast.</v>

45
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>But what you do is you hear this</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely loud noise.</v>

46
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And I remember looking around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody fell down and I fell down.</v>

47
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.441
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:01.801
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

49
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like a fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

51
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like you lose your balance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

52
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you're reaching for something to hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto,</v>

53
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>but then you go down your hands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>

54
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was really strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

55
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember being a kid in Lebanon</v>

56
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>and seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes,</v>

58
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Bama gas station from the balcony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we had to go downstairs and</v>

59
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>sleep in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garage.</v>

60
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard loud noises as a kid,</v>

62
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>very loud noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

63
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

64
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a seasoned terrorism expert</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

65
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>a experience her and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody is,</v>

67
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly wasn't think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

68
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>this was a pressure cooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was not a car bomb and that was 800</v>

69
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how many football fields</v>

70
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it was the same sort of bomb the</v>

71
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:47.890
<v Speaker 1>used in the Boston marathon bombings</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to go,</v>

72
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same kind of thing.</v>

73
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And I believe it was hooked up to a cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

74
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it was activated.</v>

75
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Your cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And when that thing went off you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew it was a mom.</v>

77
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy that the sickening thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was before that they said you got four</v>

78
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's coming off in four minutes.</v>

79
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up,</v>

80
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>we were in the front there and Jimmy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I were talking and I said,</v>

81
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this bomb goes off.</v>

82
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And I said to Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

83
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>that was a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

84
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>yes it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd go outside and I see smoke and</v>

85
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>it's quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>because there's this pause before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>storm sort of,</v>

87
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw smoke and you could smell this</v>

88
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>sort of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a burning thing,</v>

89
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it smelled like smoke um,</v>

90
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>quickly and then you then instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people running towards you in screaming,</v>

91
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>they were jogging New Yorkers like ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck man,</v>

92
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

93
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.191
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>and they were jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your instinct is to go toward the</v>

95
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.530
<v Speaker 1>blast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>make sure everybody's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the sixth thing is that when your</v>

97
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>instinct is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

98
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.220
<v Speaker 1>because I thought there's no way people</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't injured or killed as well.</v>

99
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to be on stage.</v>

100
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.070
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously all encompassing and</v>

101
00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>do you have any new material you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on?</v>

102
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I did and that's why I had to let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>fend for themselves.</v>

103
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I had to fill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always about our folks.</v>

104
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey guy here,</v>

105
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>good to be here tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you from sir?</v>

106
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>You look like Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was really bizarre was that we were</v>

107
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:13.871
<v Speaker 1>running toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

108
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to go back inside because I was</v>

109
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:16.680
<v Speaker 1>afraid it was another mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Because in Lebanon they used to always</v>
<v Speaker 1>set off an explosion.</v>

111
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>The old trick was to have people run</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward another explosion.</v>

112
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that from,</v>

113
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my mother used to always say,</v>

114
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>be careful of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds terrible.</v>

115
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Piece of information to carry around in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head when you were a child.</v>

116
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>It's also important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

117
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard because it's so maniacal cause</v>

118
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to injure people and,</v>

119
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's an old technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

120
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create a small explosion,</v>

121
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>get people to run toward the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion.</v>

122
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>There's just something incredibly fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up about people's ability to just attack</v>

123
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>and kill random people that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

124
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was playing around out that the</v>

125
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>terrorism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to spread fear and get</v>

126
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>people to behave differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna win the war with big</v>

127
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get people to change their</v>

128
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>

129
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>and the way they think.</v>

130
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And even like I told you when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chelsea market five hours before</v>

131
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so crowded and it was so,</v>

132
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I just great food people were at a spice</v>
<v Speaker 1>market in clothing and just beautiful</v>

133
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>people and I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get out of here because</v>

134
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>this feels like the place that I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb if I was a terrorist and it was</v>

135
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>just a premonition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.</v>

136
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>My thinking is different because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world we live in,</v>

137
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>so they've changed the way my energy og</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughy,</v>

138
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 1>they changed the way I behave the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we know what,</v>

139
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether I want to admit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or not,</v>

140
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I found myself to be nervous in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that,</v>

141
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>in that space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that you would have had</v>

142
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that same feeling anyway of no bomb went</v>
<v Speaker 1>off or do you really think that there</v>

143
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>was a premonition or one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you sort of connect to feeling</v>

144
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in premonitions.</v>

145
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I do if you can read signals and</v>

146
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't the case for me.</v>

147
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I just said I have an act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

148
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:56.010
<v Speaker 1>My take on that kind of stuff is maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want say,</v>

150
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's not a goddamn way to</v>

151
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

152
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but there are weird moments where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have weird thoughts,</v>

153
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but just wondering if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

154
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is there.</v>

155
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two books that were,</v>

156
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been studied and thinking fast</v>

157
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>and slow by Daniel Kahneman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won a Nobel Prize for economics and</v>

158
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>behavioral economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

159
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Malcolm Gladwell's book blink there</v>

160
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for that matter,</v>

161
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Josh Waitzkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

162
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the art of learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all three great books that I recommend</v>

163
00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>to everybody because there are signals a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

164
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>and soldiers talk about this when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've experienced a lot of IED,</v>

165
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.110
<v Speaker 1>they get very good when their life</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it at reading signals,</v>

166
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.410
<v Speaker 1>the stillness in the air behavior that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't explain.</v>

167
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>But why are those people acting a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit differently?</v>

168
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Why are the women not out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are the women not out?</v>

169
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I see any women out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it just men?</v>

170
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Why are the windows being shut right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

171
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 1>They pick up on all these little signals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in blink and in thinking fast and</v>

172
00:06:57.681 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

173
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>there are things we pick up on very</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

174
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>We just have pattern recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other things that take a long</v>

175
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>time to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

176
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So a math problem like 48 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>36 would take a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow process and you can't do a</v>

178
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>lot else when you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can recognize if somebody is</v>

179
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 1>running at you screaming with their eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>open and their hands up that they're</v>

180
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>probably going to do something physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you or something.</v>

181
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>We registered these in very quickly.</v>

182
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>The same goes for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.960
<v Speaker 1>any kind of a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably when something's about to</v>

184
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be a change in behavior.</v>

185
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>There may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't look right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that road,</v>

187
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>why is that bump in that road that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there last time?</v>

188
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of things that soldiers talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

189
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was just simply the idea</v>

190
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>that I was closed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was really great and I felt</v>

191
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>like I have coffee running to my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

192
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a caffeine high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did my yoga,</v>

193
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is too good to be true.</v>

194
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to turn around in case a bomb</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off and blows my head off that,</v>

195
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that's more just paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in this case,</v>

196
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 1>after the bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran and I said to Jimmy,</v>

197
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back inside,</v>

198
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.770
<v Speaker 1>come back inside.</v>

199
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>That could be a second bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

200
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

201
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And so we ran back inside and they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juran and now I go,</v>

202
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>but there was a bomb and they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

203
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the a bomb went off and they go,</v>

204
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the full house sold that</v>

205
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I run on stage and the real worry was</v>

206
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>my cousins were coming to see the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that they were,</v>

207
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

208
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to kind of get myself together</v>

209
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.350
<v Speaker 1>and do stand up and my heart was beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

210
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was more depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

211
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>it was less than fear than more</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression at the world.</v>

212
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>We live in that sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I did stand up and in halfway</v>

213
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 1>through or three quarters of the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>through an off duty cop who works there</v>

214
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>walked on stage cause he stopped the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

215
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers that came in with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine guns.</v>

216
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get him off stage.</v>

217
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't raid the comedy club please.</v>

218
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And Hope Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>So he walks on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally walks on and I turned and I</v>

220
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

221
00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

222
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew something was bad,</v>

223
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he took the mic out of my</v>

224
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:04.711
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

225
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>sorry folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to get you out of here.</v>

226
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And then we left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just depressing,</v>

227
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

228
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a terrorism survivor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I witnessed on blue.</v>

229
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>What did that feel like going on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after you knew that a bomb went</v>

230
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>off 800 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I asked Jimmy who was there and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well did it seem like I was nervous?</v>

232
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

233
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you just went right into pro mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it so long and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

235
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a full house and I just said,</v>

236
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you got to get it together.</v>

237
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

238
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody who's been doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way as long as I have or you have,</v>

239
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.221
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd figure our way through.</v>

241
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably was speaking faster.</v>

242
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I could feel my heart beating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also just,</v>

243
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

244
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:45.511
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

245
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:47.400
<v Speaker 1>when it's that real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

247
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are walking through their lives,</v>

248
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 1>life is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

249
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Like just accomplishing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeping yourself on the straight and</v>

250
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>narrow flossing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking working out,</v>

251
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 1>going for your dreams anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a study.</v>

252
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

253
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.240
<v Speaker 1>this is flossing is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

254
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause I use a toothpick cause I'm a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

255
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then something,</v>

256
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 1>the random can happen and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans go out the fucking window.</v>

257
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the strangest aspect of it,</v>

258
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

259
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>The randomness of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all of a sudden these moments</v>

260
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>unexpected or introduced into the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they change everything,</v>

261
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we only see our,</v>

262
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>our side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this is happening all over the</v>

263
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>world to varying degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just so insulated from this kind</v>

264
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>of stuff that when a random act like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this does happen,</v>

265
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>it's so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if this was in,</v>

266
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst aspects are the worst parts of</v>

267
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably experiencing these</v>

268
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to daily all the time.</v>

269
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the great artistic</v>

270
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look at Picasso and take a look at</v>

271
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:58.230
<v Speaker 1>what he lived through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the world that those people live</v>

272
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giacometti who,</v>

273
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made these sculptures of,</v>

274
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like people who have been</v>

275
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 1>through a holocaust to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a nuclear holocaust,</v>

276
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 1>they were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

277
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political commitment in the 20th</v>

278
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

279
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something you could not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

280
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they witnessed world wars and</v>

281
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weaponry and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

282
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Probably Influenza that killed 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people worldwide,</v>

283
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they let it inform their,</v>

284
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>their artistic expression informed their</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

285
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've talked to a world war two</v>

286
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 1>veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to old guys.</v>

287
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it like when you came back?</v>

288
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just more serious and there's</v>

289
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>more of an urgency to get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have as much time.</v>

290
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Don't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

291
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea is to whatever happens,</v>

292
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can react in a way that it in a form</v>

293
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>of paralysis or you can allow it to kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of get you to think,</v>

294
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

295
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

296
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 2>it's such a catch 22 in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>because our society has never been</v>

297
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never been easier to exist in the</v>

298
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in America.</v>

299
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's never been easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

300
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have more healthcare,</v>

301
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>we have more access to information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's less violent crime,</v>

302
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 2>there's less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

303
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Cars are safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much.</v>

304
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.070
<v Speaker 2>But because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every little thing gets blown out of</v>

305
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 2>proportion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

306
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Things like this is horrible as they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a wakeup call.</v>

307
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I remember in nine 11 right after nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 like within the next year,</v>

308
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:35.731
<v Speaker 2>we filmed fear factor in Manhattan and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was so nice.</v>

309
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fascinating.</v>

310
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like everyone was happy and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were so nice and they were so happy when</v>

311
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 2>they saw cops and firemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firemen and cops were fucking</v>

312
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 2>superheroes for like a good solid two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years like they should be.</v>

313
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 2>If people had perspective like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

314
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people that are there</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save your life,</v>

315
00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you should be so thankful and happy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there as opposed to,</v>

316
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that guy that hits the ball with a</v>

317
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 2>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>

318
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sweating when I was near him.</v>

319
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 2>There were fucking crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are crazy and as soft as things get,</v>

320
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.570
<v Speaker 2>when they get softer things get more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more added.</v>

321
00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 2>A perspective like that Matt Leblanc</v>
<v Speaker 2>story that we're talking about before</v>

322
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 2>the podcast folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the height.</v>

323
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.590
<v Speaker 2>This is the height of the craziness of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people getting upset at fucking nothing.</v>

324
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna give you the height right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Re pull that,</v>

325
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 2>pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause this is,</v>

326
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.760
<v Speaker 2>this is so classic example of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose perspective on what really matters.</v>

327
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any real existential</v>

328
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 2>threats out there to their own lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their way of life.</v>

329
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 2>So they have to find an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a classic example of being</v>

330
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>outraged at something you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged by.</v>

331
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Here's the article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says Matt Leblanc was disgusting on</v>

332
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 2>the Emmy's red carpet and can leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>showbiz now.</v>

333
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Now in this person's defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the author,</v>

334
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea if that is what she</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually wrote as her actual title</v>

335
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 2>because I know that editors change</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and you know,</v>

336
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 2>they try to make things more</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory and if it's so much easier</v>

337
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:12.600
<v Speaker 2>to make something more inflammatory when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

338
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you're an editor and you take someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>work and you add some stuff to it,</v>

339
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 2>you add a title to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows if that's what happened.</v>

340
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to clarify,</v>

341
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 2>because that is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what he says.</v>

342
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to,</v>

343
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>he's on the red carpet with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

344
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>the woman from game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emilia Clarke,</v>

345
00:14:29.951 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 2>who plays a Khaleesi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

346
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says he's objectifying women,</v>

347
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 2>but let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got disgusting characteristics.</v>

348
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

349
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 2>his actual statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

350
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I saw the first season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then kind of fell out of touch with it.</v>

351
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that's when she started</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting naked.</v>

352
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 2>So I need to catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

353
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.173
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All he said.</v>

354
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say in a,</v>

355
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>that's all he</v>

356
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is a comedic actor.</v>

357
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 1>He's doing an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to be funny.</v>

358
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just being silly.</v>

359
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Dan was like the nicest,</v>

360
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>most polite way of being pervy I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

361
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 1>But she called him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she called him and he shares some of his</v>

362
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting,</v>

363
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>disgusting characteristics like</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectifying women.</v>

364
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

365
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is her name,</v>

366
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 1>the woman who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

367
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:17.220
<v Speaker 1>So her name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

368
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Lauren holter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder really with people like this,</v>

369
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what their historical</v>

370
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 1>perspective is on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've come a long fucking way and I</v>

371
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in women's rights and you know,</v>

372
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Obama had a great speech that I listened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to it.</v>

373
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 2016 he gave it to Howard</v>
<v Speaker 1>College,</v>

374
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>which is a black college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

375
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

376
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:41.790
<v Speaker 1>there are race issues by Obama said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

377
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say some controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were all way better off.</v>

378
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

379
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so our race relations when I graduated</v>

380
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 1>in 1983,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot harder and there are more</v>

381
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to not give the that credit,</v>

382
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm give to not suggest that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are better off.</v>

383
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean there doesn't mean you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get complacent and it doesn't mean there</v>

384
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 1>isn't work to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please understand that there we have</v>

385
00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 1>come a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to not give credit for that.</v>

386
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not give credit to the foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers that did all that work from</v>

387
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 1>1983 until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were people of color.</v>

388
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's things that never been worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

390
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't have historical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you another perspective</v>

391
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that New York Times had this interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>editorial and whether this is true or</v>

392
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you define war as countries going</v>

393
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>to war over territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources with national armies,</v>

394
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 1>five out of six people on this globe are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not living in countries at war.</v>

395
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.990
<v Speaker 1>One in six are in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

396
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 1>war torn areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>

397
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 1>those areas go from Nigeria to Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

398
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

399
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>that is a large part of the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily in Middle East,</v>

400
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:58.460
<v Speaker 1>primarily the Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That area is in strife and at war and</v>

401
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But please keep in mind,</v>

402
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:05.951
<v Speaker 1>that's one in six people in the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America in the 70s and the 80s,</v>

403
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.200
<v Speaker 1>our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're military dictatorships.</v>

404
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua was a communistic t and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a communist dictator,</v>

405
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 1>but it was a communist country where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge insurgency,</v>

406
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>huge wars being fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurgencies,</v>

407
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:18.390
<v Speaker 1>lots of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

408
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 1>no democracy whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America has a lot of problems,</v>

409
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.200
<v Speaker 1>but let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they are run by civilian</v>

410
00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>governments as corrupted as they may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's big progress.</v>

411
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to kind of measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to measure where progress has</v>

412
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:34.040
<v Speaker 1>been made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it credit and,</v>

413
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>and then don't let that make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>complacent because there's always work</v>

414
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least give it credit.</v>

415
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're giving her statement</v>

416
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>way too much credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

417
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I think what she's doing brought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan and Nigeria falls.</v>

418
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's probably laughing that</v>

419
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 1>were ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're studying</v>

420
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 3>what's obviously like a clickbait</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

421
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

422
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

423
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 3>She's looking to be outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got to write a story.</v>

424
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.730
<v Speaker 3>This is a story here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got something here.</v>

425
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Let's run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

426
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what a lot of what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on with these internet sort of website</v>

427
00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of it is just,</v>

428
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 3>I just took the bait at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

429
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fake ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

430
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 3>you've seen fake ones and it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely fake to some make up a story.</v>

431
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.040
<v Speaker 3>They made up a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

432
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 3>me disarming some person at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

433
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 3>some person with a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got a text from a buddy of mine</v>

434
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 3>who's a cop and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>

435
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.360
<v Speaker 3>did you take out a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

436
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

437
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 3>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very difficult to do.</v>

438
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

439
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And people ask me if you had actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed a mountain lion with your bare</v>

440
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

441
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much money do you think they could</v>

442
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 3>make for those fixed stories?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

443
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:37.980
<v Speaker 3>what do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it real money in that a click,</v>

444
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 3>a couple hundred bucks or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>

445
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not under probably just a way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting attention,</v>

446
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.820
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there used to be,</v>

447
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.330
<v Speaker 3>used to be like the onion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the onion would say shit.</v>

448
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would read the headline and go,</v>

449
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you would read what you knew to</v>

450
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:55.490
<v Speaker 3>be satire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knew parrot,</v>

451
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 3>you knew that would be fake was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was absurd.</v>

452
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a bunch of websites that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have taken with them.</v>

453
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 3>They'd done and made it way less obvious</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're trying to be funny.</v>

454
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird.</v>

455
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.930
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that we live in a time</v>

456
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 3>and there's probably kind of a blow back</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

457
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do live in a time where people</v>

458
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 3>are just way too sensitive and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's certain loud mouths in the</v>

459
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

460
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.360
<v Speaker 3>when Alec Baldwin wrote an article</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

461
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I think I quit and it was like he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving Hollywood.</v>

462
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.541
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

463
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 3>he's done so much for gay rights and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always been a really liberal guy.</v>

464
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 3>But he called the guy a cock sucker</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the guy ended up taking pictures</v>

465
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 3>of him and his wife and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess they consider that to be</v>

466
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:38.400
<v Speaker 3>homophobic and he got just lambasted by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

467
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

468
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 3>the sort of lunatic fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was really bad and it hurt his</v>

469
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 3>feelings and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are pointing your guns at that</v>

470
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 3>wrong enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not your enemy,</v>

471
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm your advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're so you're so caught up on</v>

472
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:54.420
<v Speaker 3>your power trip.</v>

473
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's what happens to any group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any like Greenpeace is a good example.</v>

474
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.210
<v Speaker 3>The guy used to be part of Greenpeace</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

475
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got a lot of stuff done.</v>

476
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 3>But there were a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't willing to let it go because,</v>

477
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 3>and they needed a new closet in new</v>
<v Speaker 3>costs cause they were addicted to the</v>

478
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't so much about saving the</v>

479
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:12.300
<v Speaker 3>whales anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about the fact that they,</v>

480
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.360
<v Speaker 3>they had a sense of identity and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had power and they could really shake</v>

481
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:22.701
<v Speaker 3>things up and cause good people who were</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in doing good work to have to</v>

482
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:24.120
<v Speaker 3>stop and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

483
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what a lot of people are</v>

484
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:29.340
<v Speaker 3>doing by writing blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they realize it or not,</v>

485
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to claim your own space by</v>

486
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>jumping in and trying to get a reaction.</v>

487
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.770
<v Speaker 3>And in that case that Matt Leblanc cake</v>
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>

488
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:42.771
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most obvious blatant in</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre what like if that really,</v>

489
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:47.460
<v Speaker 3>that captivates a moment of your time</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than laughing or not laughing at</v>

490
00:20:47.461 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 3>that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

491
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's break down what he's saying he</v>

492
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 3>needs to catch up because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she started getting naked.</v>

493
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Are we supposed to pretend that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like looking at her naked?</v>

494
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Is that is so a man standing next to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who has been paid to be naked on</v>

495
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 3>television show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was he supposed to pretend that that's</v>

496
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 3>not an enjoyable thing to look at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How I get,</v>

497
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 3>I get confused because if a woman is</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing next to a man and says the</v>

498
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:15.810
<v Speaker 3>exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you no one gives a fuck</v>

499
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone might laugh if amy Schumer</v>

500
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 3>said that next to a Brad Pitt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if he said this?</v>

501
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 3>What if he had said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to watch it?</v>

502
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

503
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.270
<v Speaker 3>she takes her clothes off and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>objectifies women and I,</v>

504
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:31.690
<v Speaker 3>and I refuse to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid I may enjoy it if I watch it.</v>

505
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 3>And so out of respect for her and her</v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy,</v>

506
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:35.270
<v Speaker 3>even though she's taking off her clothes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

507
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.990
<v Speaker 3>and it's an artistic expression and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great TV show,</v>

508
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:43.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't approve because I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>women should take their clothes off now.</v>

509
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a pure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're puritanical.</v>

510
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 3>Do you really want to live in a world</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that?</v>

511
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Because I'll tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of countries,</v>

512
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.360
<v Speaker 3>a lot of countries like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia and a lot of other</v>

513
00:21:55.361 --> 00:21:56.640
<v Speaker 3>countries that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

514
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>

515
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:00.460
<v Speaker 3>not at the forefront of women's rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>

516
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be outraged and wouldn't let you</v>

517
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 3>see that and would censor that.</v>

518
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 3>So what are we talking about here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we talking about?</v>

519
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a joke that</v>
<v Speaker 3>objectifies women.</v>

520
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that Cosmo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two comparisons of the cosmo covers</v>

521
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 3>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says why men who objectify women are</v>

522
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 3>the effing worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the next one,</v>

523
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.970
<v Speaker 3>it's all about men's packages in</v>
<v Speaker 3>bikinis.</v>

524
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just their cocks in became,</v>

525
00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

526
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:32.731
<v Speaker 3>it is literally just an object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a full person could just</v>

527
00:22:32.771 --> 00:22:36.130
<v Speaker 3>focusing on Cox in Bikinis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same magazine.</v>

528
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by objectify women?</v>

529
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

530
00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 3>I think women that are naked or</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

531
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.230
<v Speaker 3>well objectifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treating them as objects instead of</v>

532
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

533
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to start a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>with her.</v>

534
00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to look at her naked in</v>
<v Speaker 3>dragon movie.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that okay?</v>

541
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:58.420
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want me to look at her</v>
<v Speaker 3>naked,</v>

<v Speaker 3>gold and it's all just dicks.</v>

567
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 1>When I think about objectifying women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about this like I think about,</v>

568
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've been to strip clubs,</v>

570
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've paid money to watch girls,</v>

571
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take their clothes off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here's the point.</v>

575
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was younger.</v>

576
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think when I think of objectifying</v>

577
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

578
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.121
<v Speaker 1>Cause me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

579
00:24:22.121 --> 00:24:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call me a feminist in terms of</v>

580
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:25.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can do the job,</v>

581
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck once you look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>

583
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.740
<v Speaker 1>objectifying women I suppose would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

584
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 1>she's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just good for banging.</v>

585
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just three holes or two holes</v>

586
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treating them as a nonperson.</v>

587
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

588
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:46.180
<v Speaker 1>and then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

589
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.310
<v Speaker 1>dialing them up and not really allowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to realize their potential.</v>

590
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe supporting policies or thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't sort of,</v>

591
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to do that.</v>

592
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I can understand how women have suffered</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that and continue to,</v>

593
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Russia and they talk about what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be a woman in Russia.</v>

595
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are issues like that,</v>

596
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

597
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 1>humor is really important in including</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor that objectifies women.</v>

598
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

599
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 1>it just makes it less of an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

600
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.630
<v Speaker 2>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

601
00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:25.720
<v Speaker 2>it completely depends upon what is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>humor,</v>

602
00:25:25.721 --> 00:25:27.820
<v Speaker 2>what is the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the context?</v>

603
00:25:27.821 --> 00:25:29.620
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a long,</v>

604
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:34.621
<v Speaker 2>broad range of of variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we talked about comedy material and</v>

605
00:25:34.801 --> 00:25:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that quote Unquote objectifies women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that a flippant off the cuff</v>

606
00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:43.660
<v Speaker 2>humorous remark at some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous little red carpet interview</v>

607
00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:44.920
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know those things,</v>

608
00:25:44.921 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 2>those things are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The will,</v>

609
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you have to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

610
00:25:47.951 --> 00:25:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I hope he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope he doesn't,</v>

611
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:51.250
<v Speaker 2>but he works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a working actor.</v>

612
00:25:51.251 --> 00:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>He's not comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See working actors are always subject to</v>

613
00:25:55.301 --> 00:26:00.010
<v Speaker 2>the will of people that are out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are looking to hire people.</v>

614
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.160
<v Speaker 2>You're always going to have to audition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always going to have to get</v>

615
00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:05.410
<v Speaker 2>approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Matt Leblanc is up for things is</v>

616
00:26:05.411 --> 00:26:09.580
<v Speaker 2>probably a few other guys that are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really high profile guys that are up for</v>

617
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if one of them is involved in some</v>

618
00:26:12.161 --> 00:26:16.570
<v Speaker 2>sort of scandal or some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone thinks that they're objectifying</v>

619
00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:20.320
<v Speaker 2>women and their effing horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should leave show business if that</v>

620
00:26:20.321 --> 00:26:23.410
<v Speaker 2>catches any momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this horrible things that people have</v>

621
00:26:23.411 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 2>done right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like admittedly horrible that they</v>

622
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:29.830
<v Speaker 2>themselves just fell apart like Kramer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

623
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a career killer that killed</v>

624
00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:35.460
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

625
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Like from then on he is not the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

626
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's does just that was a a monster</v>

627
00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>whopper awful thing that went down</v>

628
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.560
<v Speaker 3>so which I'm more sympathetic to because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you made that mistake,</v>

629
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.620
<v Speaker 3>if you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you made that mistake,</v>

630
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 3>you better be ready for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

631
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 3>That was offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

632
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think he had an outburst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a moment but you,</v>

633
00:26:55.571 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 3>you can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying I had an a moment and I</v>

634
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 3>punched that guy in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then stomped him in the head and he</v>

635
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 3>can't walk the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has moments where you want to</v>

636
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 3>do certain things but you got to pay the</v>
<v Speaker 3>price for that.</v>

637
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.420
<v Speaker 3>I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a complete a rumor,</v>

638
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I had heard was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine was involved.</v>

639
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 3>Now if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may not have been if it,</v>

640
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>

641
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Legal Shit out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If cocaine was involved,</v>

642
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 3>people that are on coke get ridiculously</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident and they say ridiculous shit.</v>

643
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 3>That just does not jive with everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>around them because the other people</v>

644
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:34.730
<v Speaker 3>around them aren't on coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not on coke in,</v>

645
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're on coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you're all about yourself.</v>

646
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it becomes a very sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a selfish,</v>

647
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.040
<v Speaker 3>isolated little sort of environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting,</v>

648
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.250
<v Speaker 3>you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

649
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 3>wasn't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly that's what I'm saying,</v>

650
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying he thought he could get</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with that.</v>

651
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 3>He thought he could talk like that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what they had said to him.</v>

652
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

653
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was him getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrated.</v>

654
00:27:57.061 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he's really just not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good comic and he was getting</v>

655
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 3>heckled and we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not funny.</v>

656
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 3>This isn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

657
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.040
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone tells you you're not funny.</v>

658
00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 3>And I've had it happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had someone tell me,</v>

659
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 3>oh not funny when I was bombing and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with them,</v>

660
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's nothing you can do.</v>

661
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 3>You agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think with Kramer was trying to</v>

662
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:21.261
<v Speaker 3>do is hurt their feelings and that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he thought he could hurt their</v>

663
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

664
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's a racist.</v>

665
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:27.501
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

666
00:28:27.501 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I if you said to cram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think that because people have</v>

667
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:31.470
<v Speaker 3>more melanin in their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be,</v>

668
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

669
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's how he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's that dumb.</v>

670
00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

671
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 3>again that that's hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like the Mel Gibson thing to look</v>

672
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 3>when you get drunk or you're on blow or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

673
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.740
<v Speaker 3>If you then decide that the Jews are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason everything sucks and you shout</v>

674
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 3>shouting that to a Jewish cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

675
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:55.290
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or that you know,</v>

676
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 3>you hope your girl gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 3>has had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is forced to have sex with in the 19</v>

678
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:00.620
<v Speaker 3>black theaters.</v>

679
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.260
<v Speaker 3>But using the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

680
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I've never look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

681
00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:08.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never really had those kinds of out</v>

682
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 3>that this is kind of me man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also kind of like it's called.</v>

683
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the other word?</v>

684
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's blatantly fucking racist page.</v>

685
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live in a world where you just can't</v>

686
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 3>say that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

687
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 3>It's the words of a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

688
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Because as times goes on and you become</v>
<v Speaker 3>older and you meet more people,</v>

689
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>you realize there are a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>variables when it comes to people's</v>

690
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>behavior and what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those variables are usually based on</v>

691
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:35.850
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on economics,</v>

692
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 3>on the society that they live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the family they grew up with.</v>

693
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to meet people that</v>

694
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 2>you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fill all of the blanks.</v>

695
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caucasian,</v>

696
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 2>European.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to meet people you love</v>

697
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that are all in there because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just extraordinary people and you're</v>

698
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 2>going to meet people that are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>cunts and they're going to be in all</v>

699
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>those things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way around that folks.</v>

700
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 2>And if you start siding on one gender or</v>
<v Speaker 2>one race or one patch of dirt,</v>

701
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.650
<v Speaker 2>your fucking missing the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is we are globally one</v>

702
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.140
<v Speaker 2>super organism that does not have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability yet to communicate in real time</v>

703
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 2>across the board with each other in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an incredibly honest way.</v>

704
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 2>We can't really do that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could speak a certain amount of</v>

705
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 2>languages if you're a fucking super</v>
<v Speaker 2>wizard and you can figure your way</v>

706
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 2>through a lot of countries if you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>their cultures,</v>

707
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.730
<v Speaker 2>but they're not necessarily gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand ours unless they can read our</v>

708
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:28.564
<v Speaker 2>fucking minds.</v>

709
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Speaker 2>We all speak to any different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in too many different places.</v>

710
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:35.470
<v Speaker 2>We're so used to one way of life that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

711
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 2>any variations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any breakups,</v>

712
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 2>and then one way of life throws</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything into a fucking tizzy and no</v>

713
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:43.090
<v Speaker 2>one knows what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the rest of the world is</v>

714
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 2>experiencing all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>strife.</v>

715
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this show the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>called uncharted and this guy was a,</v>

716
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I've taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this before,</v>

717
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so harsh to watch.</v>

718
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name's Jim shockey and he goes to</v>

719
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 2>all these really remote villages and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stays with the local people.</v>

720
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 2>And in this one they were getting killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by crocodiles.</v>

721
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are going to the river and</v>

722
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:09.520
<v Speaker 2>every time they would go to the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have to set up these nets and</v>

723
00:31:09.521 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 2>the crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they target people.</v>

724
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 2>So when a crocodile starts targeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

725
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 2>they have to go and shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone in the village was fucked</v>

726
00:31:16.571 --> 00:31:16.991
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

727
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in the village was losing his</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing him blends three fucking third</v>

728
00:31:20.231 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 2>or fourth person at a giant bite taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of them.</v>

729
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just live right next to this</v>

730
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:28.570
<v Speaker 2>river and they survive off that river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they live in these little huts and</v>

731
00:31:28.571 --> 00:31:33.571
<v Speaker 2>shit and he's thinking like you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about the wispy joke might</v>

732
00:31:34.811 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 2>not have been the best joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would have laughed if I was there.</v>

733
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.711
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he said that,</v>

734
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I would have shot that with silly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're trying to pretend</v>

735
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 2>that this is some sort of an outrage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this person she defending,</v>

736
00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.190
<v Speaker 2>who is she trying to defend here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is she trying to do it that.</v>

737
00:31:49.191 --> 00:31:49.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

738
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 2>It's more about her though situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

739
00:31:51.821 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 2>it's recreational outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing that people are doing.</v>

740
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

741
00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that.</v>

742
00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I love that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's recreational outrage.</v>

743
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Recreational outreach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have decided to be out.</v>

744
00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 2>If your outrage at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is really filling up your time like</v>

745
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I am going to fuck this terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

746
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I am not as Lama phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not writing about the terrorist</v>

747
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am going to write about Matt Leblanc</v>

748
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:15.280
<v Speaker 2>being a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

749
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 2>he should leave the now he's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

750
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.510
<v Speaker 2>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the problem.</v>

751
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a bomb went off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and well Matt Leblanc is sexist.</v>

752
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop saying the worst.</v>

753
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody stopped saying the worst</v>

754
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 2>because that is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no better symbol of our</v>

755
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 2>sheltered time than people saying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>

756
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this account of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain people were tortured with these</v>

757
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:40.500
<v Speaker 2>to skin them alive with sea shells.</v>

758
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>They would take like an oyster shell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would skin these people alive.</v>

759
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:46.830
<v Speaker 1>They would tie them down and skin them</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive with oyster shell.</v>

760
00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It's got to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

761
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 1>so that's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

762
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>That would be the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst.</v>

763
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Not I'm with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to say that that would be</v>

764
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 1>the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst.</v>

765
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I think a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know another,</v>

766
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.040
<v Speaker 1>here's a question really is there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency that we all have,</v>

767
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when this guy,</v>

768
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.680
<v Speaker 1>you find this guy who fucking bomb</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Chelsea and you,</v>

769
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want him to die or you want him to</v>

770
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 1>go to jail forever and I hope he suffers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

771
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 1>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to look.</v>

772
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 1>There's another way to look at things</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be not only more helpful,</v>

773
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 1>but might lead us to better solutions.</v>

774
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a good way to look at human</v>

775
00:33:23.331 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have the same hardware.</v>

776
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.840
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of work on this.</v>

777
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of,</v>

778
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we basically have the same hardware.</v>

779
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way human beings are,</v>

780
00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 1>if you draw through lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with cultures that have been not</v>

781
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exposed to a lot,</v>

782
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's been a lot of work done on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless if you're a highlander in</v>

783
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Papa New Guinea or you're northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>European,</v>

784
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senator have,</v>

785
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of government and you've been</v>

786
00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:51.560
<v Speaker 1>exposed to a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We recognize certain things.</v>

787
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most cultures have a tradition of</v>

788
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>humorous in salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

789
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's seems innately can tell the</v>

790
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:02.770
<v Speaker 1>difference between joy and discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

791
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 1>and happy and sad.</v>

792
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.330
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we essentially have the same hardware.</v>

793
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It's why you can't really look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's skin or if someone's racial</v>

794
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:19.040
<v Speaker 1>features and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize what they're capable of.</v>

795
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could that guy be a scientist?</v>

796
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:21.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's black.</v>

797
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:23.180
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't be because there aren't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of stuff.</v>

798
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.950
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all know that.</v>

799
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 1>So really what it is is software</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

800
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 1>What you have been exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your belief system,</v>

801
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.760
<v Speaker 1>what you've been told is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you've been told is right.</v>

802
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 1>What you've been told is good versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

803
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

804
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 1>essentially what motivates people to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and bad things.</v>

805
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud said that man goes to war because</v>

806
00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:53.580
<v Speaker 1>he hates people well or he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has a lot of aggression,</v>

807
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.463
<v Speaker 1>hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

808
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of other scholars would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

809
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

810
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 1>men don't go to war out of hatred.</v>

811
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.210
<v Speaker 1>They go to war out of love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to war because they love the</v>

812
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:06.500
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are defending.</v>

813
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 1>They go to war under symbols and</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>

814
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:14.621
<v Speaker 1>They go to war under and for an idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are defending because men and</v>

815
00:35:14.871 --> 00:35:19.490
<v Speaker 1>countries define themselves along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines along certain lines that they are.</v>

816
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.180
<v Speaker 1>If you think about any man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have a line and we all have a</v>

817
00:35:23.181 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 1>line that we're willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in our mind,</v>

818
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:27.020
<v Speaker 1>that we're willing to defend with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

819
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Probably at the front door of our house</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody coming in and try to get to</v>

820
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly our country and this</v>

821
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:34.880
<v Speaker 1>country is very nationalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start talking about,</v>

822
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

823
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.680
<v Speaker 1>you Americans get very nationalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you started making,</v>

824
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making fun of the flag?</v>

825
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that flag.</v>

826
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Dan.</v>

827
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's better sometimes to think to</v>

828
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what kind of software went into</v>

829
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's head,</v>

830
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 1>this guy who just did the bombings in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York?</v>

831
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 1>What kind of software was he exposed to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it wasn't good software and it</v>

832
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 1>might make us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if compassion is the word,</v>

833
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:09.681
<v Speaker 1>but it might make us more understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you understand your enemy or</v>

834
00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 1>the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may not be people,</v>

835
00:36:12.241 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 1>but rather an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the best way to then fight</v>

836
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:17.874
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

837
00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I always try to look at perspective as</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a large creation that's made with</v>

838
00:36:23.561 --> 00:36:27.850
<v Speaker 2>little tiny lego blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with every life experience that I</v>

839
00:36:27.851 --> 00:36:31.570
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to add a few more lego blocks and</v>

840
00:36:31.571 --> 00:36:34.360
<v Speaker 2>they might not change me radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But over time,</v>

841
00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 2>those lego blocks can build and become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant structure.</v>

842
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Something that you could see and look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>and measure.</v>

843
00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time one of these things</v>

844
00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:46.570
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always try to think of a,</v>

845
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.820
<v Speaker 2>there's perspective that I had when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>when my kids start walking and talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them and seeing them go from coming</v>

847
00:36:54.731 --> 00:36:57.910
<v Speaker 2>out of their mother's body to being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little person I could talk to,</v>

848
00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

849
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:05.140
<v Speaker 2>it seems like my thought was always that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were static,</v>

850
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:06.550
<v Speaker 2>that I meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

851
00:37:06.551 --> 00:37:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Mike McGee and he's 32 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Mike,</v>

852
00:37:09.131 --> 00:37:09.670
<v Speaker 2>how are ya?</v>

853
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Mike McKee.</v>

854
00:37:11.201 --> 00:37:14.140
<v Speaker 2>He's 32.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike was a baby at one point in time.</v>

855
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.990
<v Speaker 2>It came out of his mother's body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>help us a little thing like all of us</v>

856
00:37:16.991 --> 00:37:21.310
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then through all sorts of weirdness,</v>

857
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.660
<v Speaker 2>life experiences that are completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>random and people that probably were</v>

858
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:29.560
<v Speaker 2>totally unqualified teaching them things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and growing up with a bunch of other</v>

859
00:37:29.561 --> 00:37:33.760
<v Speaker 2>kids that were similar in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>similarly getting fucked up by their</v>

860
00:37:33.761 --> 00:37:36.110
<v Speaker 2>parents and their upbringing and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and their,</v>

861
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.093
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

862
00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.950
<v Speaker 2>a million different variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

863
00:37:38.951 --> 00:37:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all these alpha</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee jockeying positional things</v>

864
00:37:43.001 --> 00:37:47.140
<v Speaker 2>that go on in these relationships with</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and kids bully kids.</v>

865
00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes those kids that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullied,</v>

866
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it ruins them for the rest of their life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just,</v>

867
00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:55.330
<v Speaker 2>they're devastated for like literally to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grave from some shit that happened</v>

868
00:37:55.331 --> 00:37:56.164
<v Speaker 2>when they were 10.</v>

869
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.320
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're subject to so many different</v>

870
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:02.860
<v Speaker 2>variables and so many different points</v>
<v Speaker 2>of data entry.</v>

871
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Like data can come at us in so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways was his physical data,</v>

872
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:11.410
<v Speaker 2>whether it's just reading the news and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to understand like why would</v>

873
00:38:11.411 --> 00:38:15.880
<v Speaker 2>someone go to a nightclub in Orlando and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just start shooting gay people?</v>

874
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Why would someone drive a truck in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in France and just drive over those</v>

875
00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:22.120
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would someone do that?</v>

876
00:38:22.121 --> 00:38:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

877
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.330
<v Speaker 2>What is that was a baby at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

878
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.600
<v Speaker 2>something has led to that and we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all the things that influence</v>

879
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:32.350
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>

880
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 2>whether it's behavioral things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's things that are were beaten</v>

881
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 2>into you by just life's hard lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the big one that nobody wants</v>

882
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideologies.</v>

883
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them whatever you want.</v>

884
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You want to call them religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to call them cults,</v>

885
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 2>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>

886
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 2>But at the bottom line is they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly structured patterns of</v>

887
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 2>behavior that you are forced to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can be real dangerous if people</v>

888
00:38:57.641 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 2>don't follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody wants to admit that.</v>

889
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to admit that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave this pattern of behavior,</v>

890
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants admitted.</v>

891
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 2>If you vary from this pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and do no one any harm like</v>

892
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.940
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

893
00:39:11.941 --> 00:39:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you're to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

894
00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 2>there's some really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

895
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:15.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

896
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.430
<v Speaker 2>this Islamophobia on this show has got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop.</v>

897
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scared a lot of dogs.</v>

898
00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So let me just tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of.</v>

899
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Scare a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of questions.</v>

900
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of,</v>

901
00:39:26.161 --> 00:39:27.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ex cons.</v>

902
00:39:27.311 --> 00:39:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of pis and vans driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

903
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I was scared of clowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a lot of shit.</v>

904
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.190
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of being,</v>

905
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 2>having a phobia over a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

906
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:40.700
<v Speaker 2>a particular ideology or I'm fuck me</v>
<v Speaker 2>over pattern recognition to you.</v>

907
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:41.331
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

908
00:39:41.331 --> 00:39:42.610
<v Speaker 2>you can pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

909
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Will you stay alive by being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize patterns?</v>

910
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the,</v>

911
00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 2>but the important aspect of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is always what's important,</v>

912
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.080
<v Speaker 2>is that most people that are practicing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that on hurting anybody,</v>

913
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people that are practicing Muslims</v>

914
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 2>aren't hurting anybody because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many of them.</v>

915
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 2>If they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was a war between Muslims and</v>

916
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Christians and would just spilling out</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the streets every day,</v>

917
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ would be a blood bath</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

918
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.420
<v Speaker 2>every one in a million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 million Muslims,</v>

919
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

920
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is not a particular ideology</v>

921
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.560
<v Speaker 2>in much in as much as it's a particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>strain of the ideology,</v>

922
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:22.840
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a Christian that goes to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion clinic with a fucking high</v>

923
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:24.730
<v Speaker 2>powered rifle and starts taking people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

924
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

925
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who has the thinks they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth with a capital t,</v>

926
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 2>which is called a fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're all fundamentalists.</v>

927
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have aspects of our personalities</v>

928
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:36.400
<v Speaker 2>and our belief systems that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalists.</v>

929
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 2>If you asked me about sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll wax poetic.</v>

930
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you all about the evils of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>

931
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:44.980
<v Speaker 2>And I really believe I'm right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of data and science behind</v>

932
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

933
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all kinds of ideas about why</v>

934
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:52.150
<v Speaker 2>sugar is bad and fat and protein is good</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you because you know,</v>

935
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I've lived in and I've done it and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you have your own point of view.</v>

936
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich</v>
<v Speaker 2>today and it was damn good and it was</v>

937
00:40:58.361 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 2>damn good and you didn't hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including you probably didn't hurt</v>

938
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes cause you're not a</v>

939
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:04.930
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist cause every now and then.</v>

940
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But the other glass of milk I hope has</v>

943
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.140
<v Speaker 2>raw milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raw cause you're going to want,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I get the rock coat milk from Erewhon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and coat deep.</v>

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 2>You know you can get to hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on your horses and I think it's</v>

947
00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 2>about $35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never bought it.</v>

948
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 2>But you can get camel milk.</v>

958
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about Dick Milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about,</v>

959
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about guy cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck.</v>

960
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about fucking camel milk</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their utters in a Australia day</v>

961
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:53.510
<v Speaker 2>hunt camels and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no,</v>

962
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:56.650
<v Speaker 2>like Australia is kind of a crazy place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Australia,</v>

963
00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.540
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand are very similar in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really have any natural</v>

964
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:02.810
<v Speaker 2>predators because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were separated from the rest of the</v>

965
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 2>planet when that whole Pangea thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

966
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 2>So all they have is like they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles,</v>

967
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.860
<v Speaker 2>but crocodiles are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>

968
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:11.510
<v Speaker 2>they only get things that are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

969
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.300
<v Speaker 2>They get things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are forced to go through rivers.</v>

970
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what they get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get things through to close to the</v>

971
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:18.500
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys are fishing in waist deep water,</v>

972
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 2>but they have so many animals that</v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles are just not going to get</v>

973
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 2>like Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to kill all the</v>

974
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not going to happen.</v>

975
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 2>So they have to bring in people to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>camels.</v>

976
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to bring in people to kill a</v>

977
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 2>lot of on camels are indigenous to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia or where they brought their,</v>

978
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 2>they were brought there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's crazy man.</v>

979
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.370
<v Speaker 2>All the animals were brought there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to turn Australia and New</v>

980
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Zealand into some incredible hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>destination for old school.</v>

981
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 2>He rich dudes and like the 18 hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

982
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They totally violated the all the laws</v>

983
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 2>of ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

984
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:50.991
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

985
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:55.190
<v Speaker 2>because they brought these animals over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't bring over companion</v>

986
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 2>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have wild stags where they've</v>

987
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:02.750
<v Speaker 2>never had any Predator Chai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're roaming through the woods and</v>

988
00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:05.960
<v Speaker 2>you know how to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fly overhead with helicopters and</v>

989
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 2>gun them down and let them rot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

990
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to control the population.</v>

991
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Speaker 2>They literally sometimes are forced with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these animals to gun them down</v>

992
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.280
<v Speaker 2>and just leave them there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's delicious meat.</v>

993
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.310
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a problem with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a surplus of me.</v>

994
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the venison that we get is from</v>

995
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get elk,</v>

996
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:24.650
<v Speaker 2>it's from New Zealand and they brag</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

997
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:26.490
<v Speaker 2>And New Zealand elk filet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

998
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado's right there.</v>

999
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Like how was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on over there?</v>

1000
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what's going on over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No mountain lions.</v>

1001
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 2>No bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wolves,</v>

1002
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.140
<v Speaker 2>no coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And know people,</v>

1003
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.900
<v Speaker 2>put a couple of families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves out there.</v>

1004
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.800
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just kill the shit out of everything.</v>

1005
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I leave till the shit out of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1006
00:43:43.791 --> 00:43:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have some fun today.</v>

1007
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 2>There was an interesting story that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>posted,</v>

1008
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days ago that I read on one</v>

1009
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:50.774
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1010
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.873
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1011
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them outdoorsy type websites,</v>

1012
00:43:56.121 --> 00:44:00.050
<v Speaker 2>but it was about a guy talked about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dog got killed by wolves and that he</v>

1013
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>wasn't mad at the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He found his dog's head.</v>

1014
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't find the dog and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 18 years old German shepherd.</v>

1015
00:44:04.971 --> 00:44:07.550
<v Speaker 2>And he went walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find her and then found her</v>

1016
00:44:07.551 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 2>head and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1017
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 2>who did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would anybody do that?</v>

1018
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some crazy serial killer.</v>

1019
00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 2>And then he realizes he got further on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of evidence of a wolf attack.</v>

1020
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.120
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what a wolf does?</v>

1021
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.440
<v Speaker 2>We came pawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a wolf calf that had been killed,</v>

1022
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:26.250
<v Speaker 2>not a wolf cafe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a moose calf,</v>

1023
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 2>others that had been killed by wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1024
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada when I was there about a year</v>

1025
00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:34.200
<v Speaker 2>and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually two years ago now.</v>

1026
00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was really weird because I didn't</v>

1027
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 2>expect to see all the hair and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1028
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they'd have to like get rid of</v>

1029
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:41.630
<v Speaker 2>the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Well they say spit it up and they chew</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>

1031
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:46.610
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always just thought like when you</v>

1032
00:44:46.611 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>would find a carcass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it'd be just like torn apart.</v>

1033
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not just torn apart like Harry's</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1034
00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all over [inaudible] balm.</v>

1035
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have that picture up there.</v>

1037
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:01.410
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find the moose calf</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by a,</v>

1038
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that in living in the</v>

1039
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 2>wild?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1040
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hair everywhere?</v>

1041
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

1042
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it was something in Topanga</v>

1043
00:45:10.351 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually we are coyote gets a hold of a</v>

1044
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rabbit and there was right in Topanga,</v>

1045
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 2>there was a deer that had been killed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mountain lion.</v>

1046
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bones.</v>

1047
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all that hair.</v>

1048
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a blanket of hair.</v>

1049
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.590
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like hey in the bottom of a farmer or a</v>

1050
00:45:31.591 --> 00:45:32.760
<v Speaker 2>barn or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

1051
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 2>they had chewed all the meat off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1052
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hazing.</v>

1053
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's from a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from 96 weeks ago.</v>

1054
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking picture.</v>

1055
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1056
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.840
<v Speaker 2>We found that because of crows</v>
<v Speaker 2>crows were,</v>

1057
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were walking down this road and these</v>

1058
00:45:49.861 --> 00:45:53.520
<v Speaker 2>crows started circling overhead and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend Mike Hawk Ridge,</v>

1059
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go see what they're squawking</v>

1060
00:45:55.531 --> 00:45:57.330
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want to walk with your dog</v>

1061
00:45:57.331 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 2>on trails then in Wolf territory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know what man?</v>

1062
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Wolves for the most part we'll avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1063
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.790
<v Speaker 2>A dog usually means just people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the dog gets crazy and goes</v>

1064
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 2>chasing after him gets away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll take that thing out.</v>

1065
00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 2>And even if they're not even trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it,</v>

1066
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 2>they might take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's a competing Predator,</v>

1067
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:13.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

1068
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading this Dan Flores book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1069
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.500
<v Speaker 2>called the coyote America and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1070
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I found out about them from Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his podcast.</v>

1071
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 2>He was Vanillas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a natural history professor,</v>

1072
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think he's a,</v>

1073
00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.720
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1074
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:32.070
<v Speaker 2>either a wildlife historian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>

1075
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:37.130
<v Speaker 2>But his whole deal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm studying the history of an animal in</v>

1076
00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 2>a certain part of the world is coyote</v>
<v Speaker 2>book is fucking fast.</v>

1077
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:41.751
<v Speaker 2>And why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1078
00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:43.410
<v Speaker 2>what does he talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1079
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 2>they're all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes or wolves.</v>

1080
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all wolves.</v>

1081
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.250
<v Speaker 2>So like when people would talk to them</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these coy wolves,</v>

1082
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 2>those coy wolves would probably like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>red wolf or an eastern wolf.</v>

1083
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the coyote and that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the coyote.</v>

1084
00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're all like,</v>

1085
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.010
<v Speaker 2>like 20%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:04.330
<v Speaker 2>There's like 10% wove and 20% well</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1087
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 2>there's not like a 50 50 thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like all these crazy inner</v>

1088
00:47:08.491 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 2>breeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bottom line is they're all the</v>

1089
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 2>same animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All wolves is Haman.</v>

1090
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all canines emanated in North America.</v>

1091
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All horses evolved in North America,</v>

1092
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 2>including the same from the US.</v>

1093
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 2>They came from the Asian steppes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought so too.</v>

1094
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:26.370
<v Speaker 2>They all have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all made it over there millions of</v>

1095
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.620
<v Speaker 2>years ago from America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the really fucked up thing.</v>

1096
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't know why they went extinct in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1097
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Horse has started in America when</v>
<v Speaker 2>extinct in America thrived in other</v>

1098
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:38.020
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world and were reintroduced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to America.</v>

1099
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1100
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I showed the video of me being</v>

1101
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1102
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll start it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1103
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>can you sound Jamie and I'll play it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

1104
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 2>let me try to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.630
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point being is that there's this</v>

1106
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 2>really nutty history that I had no idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1107
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 2>All of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jackals in Africa emanated from North</v>

1108
00:47:59.441 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started out as canines here.</v>

1109
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking things spread everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've Seen Fox,</v>

1110
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1111
00:48:06.691 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in California when I was hiking and</v>

1112
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I've seen Bobcat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen Fox in Colorado,</v>

1113
00:48:11.711 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen bobcats out here.</v>

1114
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.930
<v Speaker 2>But here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1115
00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 2>the really crazy thing about coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus a,</v>

1116
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 2>any of these other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fact that gray wolves were</v>

1117
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:23.650
<v Speaker 2>like their competitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the bigger dog.</v>

1118
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They used to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They developed all these different</v>

1119
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>methods of staying alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is when they scream out,</v>

1120
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.290
<v Speaker 2>you know that that's a role call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>

1121
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 2>They're really roll call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1122
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Because some shit's gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they've killed something.</v>

1123
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.030
<v Speaker 2>We want to make sure everybody's around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone's missing,</v>

1124
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.370
<v Speaker 2>when someone doesn't respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes missing.</v>

1125
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 2>The female produces more pups in her</v>
<v Speaker 2>litter significantly.</v>

1126
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of a biological effect</v>

1127
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 2>when one goes missing and she can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>from four if it's a healthy population</v>

1128
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 2>to like 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

1129
00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 2>here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they,</v>

1130
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways that they know that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fact that these wolves are capable</v>

1131
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 2>of doing this is that when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced wolves to yellowstone,</v>

1132
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.770
<v Speaker 2>wolves hadn't been in yellowstone since</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eradicated them.</v>

1133
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people came across North</v>

1134
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed all these wolves.</v>

1135
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.990
<v Speaker 2>And the way they would do it is through</v>
<v Speaker 2>using their system of uh,</v>

1136
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 2>communicating and using their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1137
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tight knit groups and these packs</v>

1138
00:49:23.951 --> 00:49:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and their families and they stick</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1139
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:30.220
<v Speaker 2>So they would kill one wolf rub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sent all over a carcass,</v>

1140
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:33.640
<v Speaker 2>inject the carcass of a horse who would</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot a horse and Jack the horse would</v>

1141
00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.570
<v Speaker 2>strychnine so that way they're killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>two birds with one stone right there.</v>

1142
00:49:36.571 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Speaker 2>We're getting rid of the wild horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had become a real problem.</v>

1143
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 2>And they are still a problem today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wild horses.</v>

1144
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:43.660
<v Speaker 2>They kill wild horses in America all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1145
00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that either,</v>

1146
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.660
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

1147
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.740
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that there's thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of wild horses in</v>

1148
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:53.490
<v Speaker 2>North America right now to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're the thousands,</v>

1149
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 2>tens of wild horses in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that are advocating for</v>

1150
00:49:57.521 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 2>the hunting season of wild horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm real.</v>

1151
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of meat.</v>

1152
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an elk.</v>

1153
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because if you'd shot,</v>

1154
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.240
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a great deal of protest</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1155
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause we know horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ride them.</v>

1156
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like dogs man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these animals all started here.</v>

1158
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so strange there.</v>

1159
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.710
<v Speaker 2>This he gets into on Renell's podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mass extinctions that occurred</v>

1160
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the range</v>

1161
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 3>of the last ice age and maybe some time</v>
<v Speaker 3>even before that,</v>

1162
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 3>some of them and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how little they know about what killed</v>

1163
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 3>mall cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's all this speculation.</v>

1164
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's speculation that when the</v>

1165
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 3>buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know started to go extinct,</v>

1166
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 3>they had already started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well apparently the native Americans</v>

1167
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 3>that were on horseback and we're riding</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with followed the buffalo were</v>

1168
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.120
<v Speaker 3>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't like that sustainable with</v>

1169
00:50:56.121 --> 00:50:57.580
<v Speaker 3>their practices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1170
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Well this was when they started hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>with rifles on horseback was rifles.</v>

1171
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.300
<v Speaker 3>So this is all Dan Flores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is he,</v>

1172
00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 3>he advocates the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility,</v>

1173
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 3>not advocates but he brings up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility that they could have</v>

1174
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:15.190
<v Speaker 3>possibly extra painted those animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>from there.</v>

1175
00:51:15.191 --> 00:51:20.191
<v Speaker 3>Their areas just based on rifles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>horsebox without the market meat farm.</v>

1176
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.180
<v Speaker 3>So they're marketing beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>market hunting.</v>

1177
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.360
<v Speaker 3>When when they started market hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when everything went fucked up.</v>

1178
00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Cause they would kill apparently</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of buffaloes and</v>

1179
00:51:30.411 --> 00:51:32.870
<v Speaker 3>just cut the tongue's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1180
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1181
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Cause the tongues were worth money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like to eat buffalo tongues.</v>

1182
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like a delicate one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will not eat brain or tongue.</v>

1183
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't find my coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steph.</v>

1184
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:43.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all right.</v>

1185
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't find,</v>

1186
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't eat tongue or brain.</v>

1187
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm down for either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

1188
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:50.700
<v Speaker 3>I like things really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>

1189
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Oregon's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need Oregon's either.</v>

1190
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into kidney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ate liver.</v>

1191
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat liver.</v>

1192
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:59.930
<v Speaker 3>But even liver I eat because you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm there and I'm not sure what men,</v>

1193
00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's eat liver.</v>

1194
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 3>But overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck off.</v>

1195
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Fuck off with your organs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat heart heart's not bad.</v>

1196
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:12.460
<v Speaker 3>That road deer I killed in London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in England and I would shoot and things</v>

1197
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 3>in London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous.</v>

1198
00:52:15.231 --> 00:52:16.730
<v Speaker 3>But he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend has so much property,</v>

1199
00:52:16.731 --> 00:52:17.750
<v Speaker 3>has to kill 21 dear.</v>

1200
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.910
<v Speaker 3>He has to kill 21 deer on his property</v>
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>

1201
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how rich he is.</v>

1202
00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1203
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 3>so she ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1204
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:29.150
<v Speaker 3>we ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was the crunchiest and it made me</v>

1205
00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 3>sick and the warden said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1206
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a road dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to hang that for three weeks.</v>

1207
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Could you just skin it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut it up and eat it with a good glass</v>

1208
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 3>of wine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1209
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1210
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1211
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.560
<v Speaker 3>not with that kind of mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with the meat?</v>

1212
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not exaggerating,</v>

1213
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 3>it's crunchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1214
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>

1215
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.160
<v Speaker 3>like the way you would if you just cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>it up and put it in a plant and fried it</v>

1216
00:52:55.161 --> 00:52:57.110
<v Speaker 3>with butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It crunches almost like a carrot.</v>

1217
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1218
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Speaker 3>That's how hard the meat is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1219
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he got to hang it for three</v>

1220
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.140
<v Speaker 3>weeks and let it break down.</v>

1221
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.550
<v Speaker 3>You cannot eat that deer meat like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Roe.</v>

1222
00:53:09.551 --> 00:53:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Deer heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I,</v>

1223
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.330
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine deliver that tastes like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that word crunches.</v>

1224
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking about the muscle meat.</v>

1225
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 3>The Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we both got sick.</v>

1226
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't right for three days.</v>

1227
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My buddy wasn't ready for a week and the</v>

1228
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 3>game warden was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to hang that.</v>

1229
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.900
<v Speaker 3>That's a road dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to hang that.</v>

1230
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Somebody I'm sure knows about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Zana practice hanging meat is oh</v>

1231
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.490
<v Speaker 3>three waiting for things to rot minimum</v>
<v Speaker 3>of three weeks.</v>

1232
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of guys who do that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their frigerator they do their own</v>

1233
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:44.500
<v Speaker 3>version of a dry age age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1234
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're putting it on like a flat tray</v>

1235
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 3>with like a Napkin underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking delicious.</v>

1236
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:54.110
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking Galicia.</v>

1237
00:53:54.111 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

1238
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 3>When you go to the butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever go to whole foods and you</v>

1239
00:53:57.271 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 3>pass by the butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look in that window into that</v>

1240
00:53:59.311 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 3>dry aging room and just look at rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my kids were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's rot.</v>

1243
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 3>It's on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the outside of the meat.</v>

1244
00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 3>They're going to cut that away and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it looks like.</v>

1245
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Cheese cheese is just full of mold and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheese is full of mold,</v>

1246
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 3>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't identify with cheese,</v>

1247
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 3>no cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just some foreign substance.</v>

1248
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.320
<v Speaker 3>When you look at that steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you understand that that's supposed</v>

1249
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:26.070
<v Speaker 3>to be red,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like meet amazing as it's a bizarre</v>

1250
00:54:26.071 --> 00:54:29.130
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five day dry look at it,</v>

1251
00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.980
<v Speaker 3>starting to shrivel up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1252
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.050
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right down.</v>

1253
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Break it then fuck it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1254
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.110
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that people figured that out.</v>

1255
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that about roe deer.</v>

1256
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.120
<v Speaker 3>So they must be like super muscular or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1257
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.920
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of meat and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>small and they're heart.</v>

1258
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't and you're not,</v>

1259
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the size of a fucking,</v>

1260
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:51.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a midsize dog.</v>

1261
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to lose like a collie and plus</v>

1262
00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:57.400
<v Speaker 3>they're not really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1263
00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what was really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nibbling away and it wasn't,</v>

1264
00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:01.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1265
00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.460
<v Speaker 3>aw man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this,</v>

1266
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I had this $15,000 a German,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sniper rifle.</v>

1267
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:10.100
<v Speaker 3>It's called a Blouser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1268
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Blouser Lahser and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had a,</v>

1269
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.460
<v Speaker 3>and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was d I shot at standing up,</v>

1270
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I had a stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw the video and you know,</v>

1271
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.390
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't very far away.</v>

1272
00:55:22.391 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 3>If dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video apparently this thing of</v>

1273
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:28.880
<v Speaker 3>roe deer and it goes back to the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing we were talking about with um,</v>

1274
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Australia not having any natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

1275
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.980
<v Speaker 3>These roe deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bring in snipers to take them out</v>

1276
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 3>in England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High speed video footage where they blow</v>

1277
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:40.920
<v Speaker 3>their heads off their brother heads off</v>
<v Speaker 3>with plastic bullets.</v>

1278
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:41.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

1279
00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:42.091
<v Speaker 3>The plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1280
00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 3>these plastic bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.190
<v Speaker 3>because I saw that guess plastic bullets</v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't make it through there and hit</v>

1282
00:55:48.191 --> 00:55:49.500
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once they hit that,</v>

1283
00:55:49.501 --> 00:55:50.750
<v Speaker 3>it probably just explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 3>But the heads explode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1285
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.760
<v Speaker 3>have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see like a child's toy.</v>

1286
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.490
<v Speaker 3>You know those child's toys that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>squeeze and the eyes poked out of the</v>

1287
00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:00.151
<v Speaker 3>head like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1288
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's sick is that I've not only</v>

1289
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 3>seen it many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about it,</v>

1290
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:07.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as recently as a week ago,</v>

1291
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.950
<v Speaker 3>you have to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a crazy thing that here's</v>

1292
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:14.550
<v Speaker 3>this deer moving around and then here's</v>
<v Speaker 3>its head exploded and anything would</v>

1293
00:56:14.551 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 3>happen to the human being does and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do it or those things will</v>

1294
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:22.470
<v Speaker 3>overpopulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like either that or do you,</v>

1295
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've seen that video because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>

1296
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 2>really interesting video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how wolves change rivers.</v>

1297
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 2>It was about the yellowstone wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>being reintroduced into yellowstone and</v>

1298
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:35.590
<v Speaker 2>how they've changed the course of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rivers because they've killed deer,</v>

1299
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 2>which allowed these plants to grow that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't grow before and change the course</v>

1300
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 2>of the re.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1301
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 2>really interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting stuff about the</v>

1302
00:56:42.851 --> 00:56:45.880
<v Speaker 2>reintroduction of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's essentially what biologists</v>

1303
00:56:45.881 --> 00:56:48.850
<v Speaker 2>were trying to do by reintroducing</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves was introduced,</v>

1304
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:52.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a natural ecosystem because this is how</v>

1305
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not supposed to be like the</v>

1306
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:56.590
<v Speaker 2>hunters got upset because all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden these,</v>

1307
00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:58.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk herds are devastated and there's</v>

1308
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 2>like 50% of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in many ways it's kind of like a</v>

1309
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:07.141
<v Speaker 2>selfish feeling because although I side</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and I understand what they're</v>

1310
00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to wolves to be a problem</v>

1311
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>

1312
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 2>they're a part of that whole thing.</v>

1313
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:16.670
<v Speaker 2>They were there when the elk were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never elk without the wolf.</v>

1314
00:57:16.671 --> 00:57:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And when there are elk without the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get what you got to New Zealand,</v>

1315
00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:21.280
<v Speaker 2>yet people flying overhead with</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopters,</v>

1316
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:23.420
<v Speaker 2>gutting them down and sletten the meats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No top Predator.</v>

1317
00:57:23.421 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1318
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 2>it also feels fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

1319
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 2>if you were over in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going hunting and as we're going</v>

1320
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:30.611
<v Speaker 2>up the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1321
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:33.160
<v Speaker 2>what a beautiful countryside and let all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these animals,</v>

1322
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.300
<v Speaker 2>and then we hear a helicopter fly</v>
<v Speaker 2>overhead and one one ridge over there</v>

1323
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 2>just gone and down stacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we go over the top of the hill.</v>

1324
00:57:41.381 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 2>And this is like what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1325
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:45.010
<v Speaker 2>we romanticize his trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go there.</v>

1326
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:46.370
<v Speaker 2>We're going to live off the land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1327
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.820
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take a stag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1328
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Thank you stag for giving me your life.</v>

1329
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your flesh will feed my meanwhile,</v>

1330
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:55.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking helicopter just</v>
<v Speaker 2>indiscriminately gunning him down</v>

1331
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:56.950
<v Speaker 2>because there's too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit in the grass.</v>

1332
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

1333
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.001
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

1334
00:57:58.001 --> 00:57:58.811
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

1335
00:57:58.811 --> 00:57:59.141
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

1336
00:57:59.141 --> 00:57:59.441
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot.</v>

1337
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 2>And they just let them run up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1338
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 2>And it's a Chi being there with my knife</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken off a bunch of steak and that's</v>

1339
00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:05.600
<v Speaker 2>what we'd be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd camp right,</v>

1340
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 2>but we'd be bummed out and we wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't shoot an animal.</v>

1341
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:08.951
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1342
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I could justify shooting</v>

1343
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:12.630
<v Speaker 2>an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way this is,</v>

1344
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 2>there's meet here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just killed.</v>

1345
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1346
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.400
<v Speaker 2>So we're just going to chalk this off to</v>
<v Speaker 2>an experience.</v>

1347
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:19.480
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be a bit,</v>

1348
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 2>we talk about on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1349
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:23.600
<v Speaker 2>here's the deer's head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exploded.</v>

1350
00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very cute.</v>

1351
00:58:24.791 --> 00:58:25.900
<v Speaker 2>When it might been a fall.</v>

1352
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Is it a button by going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord has got a good shot.</v>

1353
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 2>He shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the plastic bullet.</v>

1354
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they use plastic bullets</v>

1355
00:58:34.751 --> 00:58:38.040
<v Speaker 2>because they're doing them in urban</v>
<v Speaker 2>environments because they're using rf</v>

1356
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.090
<v Speaker 2>suppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic bullets.</v>

1357
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.990
<v Speaker 2>And Bob Lang take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1358
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a place in Pennsylvania where</v>

1359
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>they allow deer hunting all throughout</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year because there's so many fucking</v>

1360
00:58:49.931 --> 00:58:53.290
<v Speaker 2>deer and people set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tree stands in their backyards and the</v>

1361
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:58.291
<v Speaker 2>higher hunters or or like advertise for</v>
<v Speaker 2>punters to come and shoot their deer.</v>

1362
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.260
<v Speaker 2>My mother in Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

1363
00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 2>she would plant flowers and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with our flowers and the deer</v>

1364
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:10.831
<v Speaker 2>would come in and eat them and my mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>in very soon walked into my room and</v>

1365
00:59:11.861 --> 00:59:12.694
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to me,</v>

1366
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy a crossbow and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this shooting stuff.</v>

1367
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I want you to kill the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1368
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1369
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 3>it's very illegal though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>

1370
00:59:24.681 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 3>I know so you're going to have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>very careful.</v>

1371
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:28.761
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1372
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:31.700
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's super early like we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in big trouble.</v>

1373
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the point.</v>

1374
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I want you to kill the deer that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating my flowers.</v>

1375
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.304
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it.</v>

1376
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 3>I didn't because I talked her out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1377
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to put a fence over your fucking</v>

1378
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:46.760
<v Speaker 3>flowers because I think we could get</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine like $100,000 or something crazy</v>

1379
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 3>for your flowers and that's probably not</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth it.</v>

1380
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to jail.</v>

1381
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.330
<v Speaker 3>But I know a lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>

1382
00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how to use a crossbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1383
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1384
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:56.840
<v Speaker 3>it'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the beautiful thing about</v>

1385
00:59:56.841 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 3>crossbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to do the learning curve</v>

1386
00:59:58.671 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 3>super short.</v>

1387
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Just as long as you're resting it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1388
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:03.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't punch the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all you have to learn how to do</v>

1389
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:04.830
<v Speaker 3>it across what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready,</v>

1390
01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1391
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.890
<v Speaker 3>don't jerk it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't jerk it.</v>

1392
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's an instinct to juggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go like that's his goal.</v>

1393
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Glitter it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three quarters of the witch schoolies</v>

1394
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.430
<v Speaker 3>gently Vega all on the trigger sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just moves.</v>

1395
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Chigger doesn't even know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the trip.</v>

1396
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:21.921
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1397
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 3>just push,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push,</v>

1398
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.030
<v Speaker 3>push,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read.</v>

1399
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:27.260
<v Speaker 3>The real reason I didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember is a not because I didn't</v>

1400
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:31.130
<v Speaker 3>think I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was more because I figured if I shot</v>

1401
01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 3>the deer with a crossbow or a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow,</v>

1402
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.490
<v Speaker 3>it would run and I'd have to track it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it would run into somebody else's</v>

1403
01:00:37.491 --> 01:00:39.410
<v Speaker 3>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'd find a deer that had a</v>

1404
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:41.280
<v Speaker 3>bow and Arrow and then they'd come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>find,</v>

1405
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>they trace it back.</v>

1406
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I heard a story about a rich lady in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malibu.</v>

1407
01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:46.910
<v Speaker 3>They may have done the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trimming letter actually shot a fucking</v>

1408
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.250
<v Speaker 3>deer in her backyard with a crossbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1409
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Because it was eating her flowers may or</v>
<v Speaker 3>may not have.</v>

1410
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's May or may not have.</v>

1411
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:54.980
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird stories you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing from other moms and you know,</v>

1412
01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:56.450
<v Speaker 3>people talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what Mary did?</v>

1413
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got a chronicle meet.</v>

1414
01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that if I could get away</v>

1415
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good meat seat.</v>

1416
01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:04.120
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1417
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.600
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good move.</v>

1418
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:06.560
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1419
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 3>it goes to that age old problem that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of us have with the idea of death.</v>

1420
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:13.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody to kill me and eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1421
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>

1422
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:16.670
<v Speaker 3>why do I want to kill that animal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat that animal?</v>

1423
01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 3>And we have this very strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with these animals now,</v>

1424
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:23.550
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've like,</v>

1425
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 2>we've contracted all of our food</v>
<v Speaker 2>collection off to other people.</v>

1426
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that just didn't</v>

1427
01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>exist for most of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So over the last x amount of years,</v>

1428
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.870
<v Speaker 2>we've contracted all of our food</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquisition.</v>

1429
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that I could just get</v>
<v Speaker 2>this plastic thing of water and I know</v>

1430
01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:45.570
<v Speaker 2>it's legit crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to hear this,</v>

1431
01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:47.610
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1432
01:01:47.611 --> 01:01:49.980
<v Speaker 2>that little snap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means nobody poisoned it.</v>

1433
01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>It's fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1434
01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.570
<v Speaker 2>it's sealed fresh from the factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can have a nice glass of water.</v>

1435
01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to go to a river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to pump.</v>

1436
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1437
01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way better this way.</v>

1438
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is by us not being in</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature at all by not interacting with</v>

1439
01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:08.940
<v Speaker 2>animals at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've allowed these monsters to develop</v>

1440
01:02:08.941 --> 01:02:11.700
<v Speaker 2>these slaughterhouses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's houses of horror.</v>

1441
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.720
<v Speaker 2>He's a factory farm mechanisms like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've really fucked up.</v>

1442
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 2>We've gotten so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the cities that don't make food,</v>

1443
01:02:19.711 --> 01:02:24.270
<v Speaker 2>need so much food on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've completely removed ourselves</v>

1444
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>from the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of growing things of,</v>

1445
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of we've like,</v>

1446
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 2>about being a person as eating healthy</v>

1447
01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:33.251
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most important things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have healthy food,</v>

1449
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really that simple,</v>

1450
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you eat fucking just peanut</v>

1451
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>butter and jelly sandwiches like I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

1452
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 2>if you have that all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day for the rest of your life,</v>

1453
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have a shitty short fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1454
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough nutrients in that,</v>

1455
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.450
<v Speaker 2>but we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't think about it,</v>

1456
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so busy with stocks and with</v>

1457
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.690
<v Speaker 2>marriage and with fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get,</v>

1458
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 2>where are we going to thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1459
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.760
<v Speaker 2>making an addition on the house.</v>

1460
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get that man cave</v>

1461
01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.400
<v Speaker 3>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy though.</v>

1462
01:03:03.401 --> 01:03:05.170
<v Speaker 3>We've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have figured out a way to get a lot</v>

1463
01:03:05.171 --> 01:03:09.100
<v Speaker 3>of protein in people's bodies had cheap</v>
<v Speaker 3>for cheap and he used to be that meet</v>

1464
01:03:09.101 --> 01:03:13.900
<v Speaker 3>with something that countries I remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of countries that I lived in,</v>

1465
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:14.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were like,</v>

1466
01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:17.140
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would eat and meet twice a year,</v>

1467
01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.670
<v Speaker 3>the bedouin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:21.520
<v Speaker 3>who are very healthy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lived on dates and bread and,</v>

1469
01:03:21.521 --> 01:03:24.250
<v Speaker 3>and go a camel milk and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

1470
01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:26.320
<v Speaker 3>the traditional indigenous people of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

1471
01:03:26.321 --> 01:03:28.900
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would eat meat twice,</v>

1472
01:03:28.901 --> 01:03:30.220
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four times a year,</v>

1473
01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.890
<v Speaker 3>meet with a real delicacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very expensive.</v>

1474
01:03:32.891 --> 01:03:34.030
<v Speaker 3>You'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have a goat.</v>

1475
01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.370
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not easy to come by.</v>

1476
01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:38.470
<v Speaker 3>There was very little water and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1477
01:03:38.471 --> 01:03:43.090
<v Speaker 3>So in a way we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've given ourselves a food problem,</v>

1478
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:44.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the pendulum has,</v>

1479
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.340
<v Speaker 3>we have people at eat obviously too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

1480
01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>And then you have lobbying efforts to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get as much corn syrup and things like</v>

1481
01:03:52.481 --> 01:03:54.300
<v Speaker 3>that into people's bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1482
01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.480
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1483
01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.760
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right though.</v>

1484
01:03:57.761 --> 01:04:02.761
<v Speaker 3>We've gotten away from a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that just is easy to do to make</v>

1485
01:04:03.191 --> 01:04:05.530
<v Speaker 3>yourself healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sleep and water.</v>

1486
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.180
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are giant.</v>

1487
01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.740
<v Speaker 3>The sleep of water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant.</v>

1488
01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I just think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1489
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I think we're way too removed from what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is an essential aspect of life.</v>

1490
01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:20.110
<v Speaker 3>The process of food acquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes people really confused.</v>

1491
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.220
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1492
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could look at it as an enthusiast and</v>

1493
01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I can look at it as someone who enjoys</v>
<v Speaker 3>being outside.</v>

1494
01:04:26.921 --> 01:04:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the woods,</v>

1495
01:04:28.691 --> 01:04:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy fishing and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy catching something in the water</v>

1496
01:04:32.831 --> 01:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>and then cooking it and eating it.</v>

1497
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.820
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy this so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to show his money in the</v>

1498
01:04:36.821 --> 01:04:39.100
<v Speaker 3>food business and then it good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1499
01:04:39.101 --> 01:04:41.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to make the food companies</v>

1500
01:04:41.171 --> 01:04:42.470
<v Speaker 3>have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was going to say is,</v>

1501
01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.970
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to do it every day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to be the only way I can</v>

1502
01:04:45.971 --> 01:04:48.160
<v Speaker 3>survive because it's too hard to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>

1503
01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:51.310
<v Speaker 3>So we figured out a way to make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>really easy to get food.</v>

1504
01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.250
<v Speaker 3>The hardest part of life now becomes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>easiest part of life.</v>

1505
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1506
01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:59.740
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about why did philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why were the Greeks,</v>

1507
01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to sit around and think,</v>

1508
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:05.830
<v Speaker 3>so you had plato and socrates and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotle.</v>

1509
01:05:05.831 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1510
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.180
<v Speaker 3>William McNeil I think wrote this book</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that,</v>

1511
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:14.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Greeks had access to timber,</v>

1512
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:19.120
<v Speaker 3>olive oil and wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were to export those things and</v>

1513
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 3>exchange them for goods that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed.</v>

1514
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 3>So it meant that they didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>live a subsistence lifestyle.</v>

1515
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:28.570
<v Speaker 3>They also lived in a temperate climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they didn't have to spend so much</v>

1516
01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 3>time getting ready for the winter flip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1517
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:32.200
<v Speaker 3>super busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fuck,</v>

1518
01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:35.570
<v Speaker 3>they were doing a lot of butt fucking as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well before there were,</v>

1519
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:39.130
<v Speaker 3>there were any probably diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't have any diseases back</v>

1520
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1521
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1522
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Just died by plagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but entire civilizations.</v>

1523
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.760
<v Speaker 3>But you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>

1524
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:48.850
<v Speaker 3>when you're able to get your food</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly like that water,</v>

1525
01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.330
<v Speaker 3>it leaves time for other things like God</v>
<v Speaker 3>casting.</v>

1526
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1527
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:53.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1528
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.000
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an awesome thing.</v>

1529
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be real nice if we</v>

1530
01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:03.340
<v Speaker 3>could all in some way reconnect the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll give us a little bit more</v>

1531
01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:08.341
<v Speaker 3>perspective on things because the w the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world that we have right now is the best</v>

1532
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:10.810
<v Speaker 3>world that's ever lived for sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever lived,</v>

1533
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 3>that ever existed.</v>

1534
01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:12.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1535
01:06:12.521 --> 01:06:15.010
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this civilization that we're existing in</v>

1536
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no question.</v>

1537
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no question.</v>

1538
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just so much easier to be informed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much easier to improve yourself.</v>

1539
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.520
<v Speaker 3>So much easier to get feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much easier to communicate with</v>

1540
01:06:24.521 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to know things and there's trust.</v>

1541
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.670
<v Speaker 3>There's trust in institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1542
01:06:28.671 --> 01:06:30.010
<v Speaker 3>at least in this country that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1543
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.430
<v Speaker 3>when you just said I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is freshwater from a factory,</v>

1544
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what went into it,</v>

1545
01:06:35.651 --> 01:06:38.260
<v Speaker 3>but you trust that when you drink that</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1546
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:40.860
<v Speaker 3>it's from whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to die of.</v>

1547
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody poisoned that water.</v>

1548
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Nobody took shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not feces in that water.</v>

1549
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 3>A lot of countries you couldn't say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know who's taking,</v>

1550
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.790
<v Speaker 3>who's running control and who's got the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

1551
01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 3>their pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're really lucky in this country</v>

1552
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 3>that we have institutions we can trust</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a police force.</v>

1553
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 3>We can trust overall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's certain crops,</v>

1554
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.450
<v Speaker 3>the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are uh,</v>

1555
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:02.500
<v Speaker 3>the courts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is objective law.</v>

1556
01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Those things are fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so lucky that we all have things</v>

1557
01:07:07.031 --> 01:07:09.670
<v Speaker 3>like due process and representative</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1558
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about a police</v>
<v Speaker 3>force knocking on my door.</v>

1559
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you've been up to stuff,</v>

1560
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody who has more power than me</v>

1561
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 3>buying a government official who can</v>
<v Speaker 3>then knock on my door and put me in jail</v>

1562
01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:21.940
<v Speaker 3>on trumped up charges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there examples of that?</v>

1563
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part other than a</v>

1564
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:25.240
<v Speaker 3>country where that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>

1565
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I just took this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Fox News rent.</v>

1566
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 3>You should get that Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1567

<v Speaker 3>That's going to get you the Fox News</v>

1568

1569
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News,</v>

1570
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.490
<v Speaker 3>if they could just take Donald Trump to</v>
<v Speaker 3>task a little more polite.</v>

1571
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.880
<v Speaker 3>How about you right next to Alex Jones</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd be like the voice of reason,</v>

1572
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have a hannity and colmes it</v>

1573
01:07:42.371 --> 01:07:43.760
<v Speaker 3>callen and Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1574
01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.250
<v Speaker 3>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1575
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I just read your boy Michael Schirmer's</v>
<v Speaker 3>book skeptic,</v>

1576
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:47.840
<v Speaker 3>which I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1577
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:50.020
<v Speaker 3>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Michael Shermer is created at,</v>

1578
01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:52.030
<v Speaker 3>taken on the conspiracy theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1579
01:07:52.031 --> 01:07:53.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's great at being reasonable about</v>

1580
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 3>things like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1581
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 3>he broke down the whole fire walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and he explained how he did it and</v>

1582
01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:01.150
<v Speaker 3>he was explaining in a scientific way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's about conductivity.</v>

1583
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:04.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a reason why we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>cook on the coals themselves because</v>

1584
01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 3>they're not very good conductors of</v>
<v Speaker 3>heat.</v>

1585
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It's why heat up metal and the metal</v>
<v Speaker 3>grate that goes over your grill.</v>

1586
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.130
<v Speaker 3>You Cook on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:08:11.131 --> 01:08:12.430
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to walk on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1588
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 3>when you walk on those coals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it takes a while for you as</v>

1589
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 3>long as you move quickly.</v>

1590
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't spend too much time with one</v>

1591
01:08:19.071 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 3>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get all right.</v>

1592
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 3>He's like heels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave us an actual scientific</v>

1593
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:23.720
<v Speaker 3>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1594
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.330
<v Speaker 3>after about 10 to 15 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of gets crazy.</v>

1595
01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause then it's just too much time of</v>

1596
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you touching the coals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like eight to 10 feet.</v>

1597
01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:32.570
<v Speaker 3>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and Sam Harris,</v>

1598

<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer.</v>

1605
01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that he wanted to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about with this increased presence of</v>

1606
01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 3>people that honestly believe that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>is some sort of a conspiracy,</v>

1607
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:57.110
<v Speaker 3>that the earth is flat and that can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even get,</v>

1608
01:08:57.111 --> 01:08:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the energy.</v>

01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:55.980
<v Speaker 3>you know when you have people reaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same conclusion from independent</v>

1630
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:00.800
<v Speaker 3>lines of inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got so many different independent</v>

1631
01:10:00.801 --> 01:10:02.750
<v Speaker 3>lines of inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are doing their own research and</v>

1632
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:07.670
<v Speaker 3>they all converge on one conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are then coming in to say,</v>

1633
01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:10.720
<v Speaker 3>well this is my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a conspiracy theorist said,</v>

1634
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 3>well yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's all this unexplained</v>

1635

1644
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:38.990

<v Speaker 3>Maybe flatter doesn't need a washed up</v>

1645
01:10:38.991 --> 01:10:42.680
<v Speaker 3>failure anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag flat Earth Ah man.</v>

1646
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:47.060
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's video taken from the space</v>

1647
01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:50.510
<v Speaker 3>station of the earth being round and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have them circling the earth.</v>

1648
01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:53.570
<v Speaker 3>There's time lapse video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see time lapse video of the</v>

1649
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Sun rising and falling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could see it.</v>

1650
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1651
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.560
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they think that is?</v>

1652
01:11:00.561 --> 01:11:01.550
<v Speaker 3>That's all fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1653
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Then all those people are liars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One has ever gone up.</v>

1654
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Their satellites aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that's another one they do?</v>

1655
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:08.240
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1656
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>They think that satellites are actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>low flying planes.</v>

1657
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I find they're probably just at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the day,</v>

1658
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>they need to belong to a group and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be exclusive.</v>

1659
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit like the modern art.</v>

1660
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>When Ann Rand I ran was walking through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the museum of modern art and they were,</v>

1661
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:31.020
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people were kind of clustered</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that broom that had been stuffed</v>

1662
01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>into a pail and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not interesting.</v>

1663
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really expensive.</v>

1664
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Then they went in and there was just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>three light bulbs that had been strung</v>

1665
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:44.200
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging and,</v>

1666
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.233
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1667
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what the fuck is going on here.</v>

1668
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:53.090
<v Speaker 1>These people are all trying to belong to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exclusive group and they're not</v>

1669
01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:58.710
<v Speaker 1>really even looking at this art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to be,</v>

1670
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the cool kids that get it.</v>

1671
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it cause you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

1672
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.080
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that they don't play chess and</v>

1673
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't collect wine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So this is their shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their shit.</v>

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you were getting into Cooper Union or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because you were just too</v>

1717
01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 1>literal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were not part of this ICT guys.</v>

1718
01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>That is the abstract movement and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>how human beings are.</v>

1719
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see like a Jackson pollock,</v>

1720
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 1>did you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever go,</v>

1721
01:14:10.081 --> 01:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be cool to have or do you go,</v>

1722
01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1723
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.170
<v Speaker 3>in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about art,</v>

1724
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.110
<v Speaker 3>which I with point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>

1725
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a groundbreaker I guess in some</v>

1726
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:23.230
<v Speaker 3>ways in that he said he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1727
01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.890
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 3>He was a groundbreaker in splashing</v>
<v Speaker 3>paint like a little kid would do well,</v>

1729
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.700
<v Speaker 3>but then he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was doing something,</v>

1730
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1731
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1732
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:37.390
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is like get in with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right group.</v>

1733
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do acid and below woody allen,</v>

1734
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 3>you smoke cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He yell at your secretary,</v>

1735
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I paint would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's brilliant.</v>

1736
01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:45.850
<v Speaker 3>He's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

1737
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:48.760
<v Speaker 3>The guy's just standing over at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point and you know,</v>

1738
01:14:48.761 --> 01:14:50.620
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're one of those guys out there</v>

1739
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:52.150
<v Speaker 3>that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you Joe Rogan.</v>

1740
01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big Jackson pollock fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know shit about art obviously.</v>

1741
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1742
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 3>He had something else about art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the difference between how I see</v>

1743
01:14:59.681 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 3>things and how other people see things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he had did something else.</v>

1744
01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:04.810
<v Speaker 3>He was doing something actually much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more deliberate than that.</v>

1745
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:07.570
<v Speaker 3>So you ready for my Jackson pollock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a education here?</v>

1746
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.220
<v Speaker 3>I believe Jackson pollock was painting</v>
<v Speaker 3>fractals.</v>

1747
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were so,</v>

1748
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:18.560
<v Speaker 3>so a fractal would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the coastline of a,</v>

1749
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.610
<v Speaker 3>of a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you look at the micro,</v>

1750
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

1751
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:24.890
<v Speaker 3>the micro sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1752
01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines in that particular,</v>

1753
01:15:27.931 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they mimic the larger picture,</v>

1754
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 3>the larger coastline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a fractal,</v>

1755
01:15:33.131 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jackson pollock was different</v>

1756
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:37.900
<v Speaker 3>because not only it was the first guy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start doing that,</v>

1757
01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:42.250
<v Speaker 3>but he was deliberately creating what</v>
<v Speaker 3>other painters were not able to do,</v>

1758
01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:44.080
<v Speaker 3>which was fractals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

1759
01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please somebody tell me that I'm right</v>

1760
01:15:47.261 --> 01:15:50.830
<v Speaker 3>about that personal reflections on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson pollock.</v>

1761
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.590
<v Speaker 3>So is that the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1762
01:15:52.591 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they're showing color</v>
<v Speaker 3>Palette painted nightdress fractals.</v>

1763
01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.473
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to be,</v>

1764
01:15:58.690 --> 01:15:59.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what fractals,</v>

1765
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:03.940
<v Speaker 3>the best way to describe fractals is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a geometric pattern that as you get</v>

1766
01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 3>closer to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the,</v>

1767
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.130
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at it from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a very particular shape.</v>

1768
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Like the Mandelbrot set is a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>example of,</v>

1769
01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:13.720
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an amazing fractal.</v>

1770
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 3>And it was one of the ones that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the really nutty people used as proof</v>

1771
01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:22.951
<v Speaker 3>that crop circles were from extra</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrials because mathematicians had</v>

1772
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:25.890
<v Speaker 3>only figured out the Mandelbrot set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1773
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I want to say less than a year before</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crop circle appeared with a perfect</v>

1774
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:36.751
<v Speaker 3>mandelbrot set in some wheat field and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of this pull up a Mandelbrot</v>

1775
01:16:37.091 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 3>set.</v>

1776
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:40.540
<v Speaker 3>So you could see this actually an</v>
<v Speaker 3>animated version of the Mandelbrot set,</v>

1777
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 3>which is really the best way to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because as it goes closer you can see</v>

1778
01:16:44.711 --> 01:16:47.560
<v Speaker 3>that it's the same thing on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a smaller scale.</v>

1779
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:50.500
<v Speaker 3>And then it go you a closer than that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the same thing you saw on the</v>

1780
01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:54.040
<v Speaker 3>outside but in a much smaller scale and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it goes on and on.</v>

1781
01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.810
<v Speaker 3>That's apparently what what pollock was</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do that other painters have not</v>

1782
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 3>been able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was something,</v>

1783
01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:01.750
<v Speaker 3>here's the animation of the Mandelbrot</v>
<v Speaker 3>set,</v>

1784
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:06.751
<v Speaker 3>so it's just crazy looking weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that as you get closer to it and it</v>

1785
01:17:07.061 --> 01:17:08.110
<v Speaker 3>expands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start,</v>

1786
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:10.790
<v Speaker 3>it starts revealing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's end.</v>

1787
01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.660
<v Speaker 3>It starts revealing how bizarre it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as you see all these little things</v>

1788
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:18.060
<v Speaker 3>that stick out of these circles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these giant circles and smaller circles</v>

1789
01:17:18.061 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 3>and then even smaller circles that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to that giant circle and each</v>

1790
01:17:21.351 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 3>one of those gets infinitely smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps repeating.</v>

1791
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it never ends.</v>

1792
01:17:25.881 --> 01:17:29.390
<v Speaker 3>You keep going deep into these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you find another small circle and it</v>

1793
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:32.990
<v Speaker 3>has smaller circles on it and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ed and the smaller circles and it just</v>

1794
01:17:32.991 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 3>keeps going on and on and on and on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1795
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.950
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So pull up the crop circle Mandelbrot</v>

1796
01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 3>set and see if you could find the</v>
<v Speaker 3>history on it.</v>

1797
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like one of those things where</v>

1798
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look someone who's doing these either</v>

1799
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:51.011
<v Speaker 3>the hoaxer is very educated and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a mathematician and understands</v>

1800
01:17:51.471 --> 01:17:56.260
<v Speaker 3>the proportions in making a correct</v>
<v Speaker 3>manner or reasonably correct mandelbrot</v>

1801
01:17:56.270 --> 01:18:00.380
<v Speaker 3>set or daily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going with aliens,</v>

1802
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going with the audience to do more</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

1803
01:18:02.181 --> 01:18:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy though?</v>

1804
01:18:03.371 --> 01:18:06.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful looking little thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone made in the wheat field,</v>

1805
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:10.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that it's impossible to</v>

1806
01:18:10.671 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 3>walk and not leave trails like oh</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these lines in there.</v>

1807
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:19.940
<v Speaker 3>He fucks like what about those roads</v>
<v Speaker 3>like go up like it's impossible to walk,</v>

1808
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:22.010
<v Speaker 3>like go to the image and make that</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger.</v>

1809
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.050
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to walk in there and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>be detected.</v>

1810
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see roads.</v>

1811
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you see those fucking roads?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1812
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucking people,</v>

1813
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:30.740
<v Speaker 3>they never want to see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1814
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:33.290
<v Speaker 3>They always want to like look at only</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conspiracy.</v>

1815
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's fun.</v>

1816
01:18:34.731 --> 01:18:36.320
<v Speaker 3>I used to be one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.720
<v Speaker 3>And Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his book he talks about in Spanish</v>

1818
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.060
<v Speaker 3>skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talks about Thomas Eager,</v>

1819
01:18:41.061 --> 01:18:43.820
<v Speaker 3>I think mit professor who talks about</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1820
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.620
<v Speaker 3>jet fuel that Burns at 2,700 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1821
01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 3>and steal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1822
01:18:47.901 --> 01:18:49.890
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't melt a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember,</v>

1823
01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Still Burns at 1200 degrees and the</v>

1824
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:55.640
<v Speaker 3>steel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structural steel in the World Trade</v>

1825
01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't melt until it's 2,700</v>

1826
01:18:57.861 --> 01:18:59.270
<v Speaker 3>degrees and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

1827
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:01.760
<v Speaker 3>the jet fuel may have gotten up to 1400</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees.</v>

1828
01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 1200 degrees or 1400 degrees,</v>

1829
01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:10.150
<v Speaker 3>steel loses 50% of its integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Structural steel and the steel.</v>

1830
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 3>And this was this guy from mit who is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual,</v>

1831
01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:16.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professor of engineering when it comes</v>

1832
01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:17.700
<v Speaker 3>to metallurgy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1833
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:20.420
<v Speaker 3>and when you're at the Massachusetts</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

1834
01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:22.250
<v Speaker 3>you know some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you're a professor.</v>

1835
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 3>That's why I hated that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to just melt.</v>

1836
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:25.701
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1837
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 3>he'd say when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's irregularities in that</v>

1838
01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:30.090
<v Speaker 3>structure over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1839
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.750
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of feet and there are hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of degrees of reg and regulators.</v>

1840
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:36.560
<v Speaker 3>It will buckle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll that things will buckle.</v>

1841
01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:38.810
<v Speaker 3>It'll break the clamps off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the next thing you know,</v>

1842
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.240
<v Speaker 3>do you know what percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about this crazy thing?</v>

1843
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.880
<v Speaker 3>This is also from Thomas Ego who is at</v>
<v Speaker 3>mit professor,</v>

1844
01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:48.110
<v Speaker 3>do you know what percentage of the World</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trade Center Tower,</v>

1845
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:52.190
<v Speaker 3>one of them was of air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what percentage was made up of the</v>

1846
01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:52.850
<v Speaker 3>air?</v>

1847
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:56.360
<v Speaker 3>You think it was 50%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20% meaning like if you look at the</v>

1848
01:19:56.361 --> 01:20:00.040
<v Speaker 3>whole structure on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of the inside is made of Aser?</v>

1849
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good percentage of every building's made</v>

1850
01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 3>of air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1851
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's like a honeycomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1852
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1853
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a normal building?</v>

1854
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.473
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1855
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.430
<v Speaker 3>normal buildings have a lot of concrete</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're made it.</v>

1856
01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 3>This is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an incredible building that was</v>

1857
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 3>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was basically a giant sail and it was</v>

1858
01:20:18.631 --> 01:20:21.930
<v Speaker 3>able to take an incredible amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>

1859
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.110
<v Speaker 3>not only from planes but from wind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 300 mile an hour,</v>

1860
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:25.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

1861
01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:28.620
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy stuff.</v>

1862
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:33.390
<v Speaker 3>And so it was an incredible feat of</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering designed by this Japanese,</v>

1863
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:38.391
<v Speaker 3>a architect and it was 110 stories high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>95% of that structure was air 95% which</v>

1864
01:20:40.741 --> 01:20:41.700
<v Speaker 3>is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1865
01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 3>And so when it pancake that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1866
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:46.280
<v Speaker 3>it felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt,</v>

1867
01:20:46.281 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 3>that's why it fell down that way.</v>

1868
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:48.931
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1869
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Stop making buildings that are that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1870
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's settle the fuck down.</v>

1871
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1872
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:56.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make it so big.</v>

1873
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.810
<v Speaker 3>It's big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big building.</v>

1874
01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.030
<v Speaker 3>It seems silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about you make two smaller</v>

1875
01:21:00.031 --> 01:21:01.110
<v Speaker 3>buildings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck,</v>

1876
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:05.460
<v Speaker 3>it was a feat of Manhattan and they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something awesome and revitalize</v>

1878
01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:08.120
<v Speaker 3>the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a revitalization project there.</v>

1879
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 3>The real problem with conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>theories is it,</v>

1880
01:21:10.591 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>some of them are true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem.</v>

1881
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:18.590
<v Speaker 3>When you start going over history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get paralyzed by all the</v>

1882
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 3>possibilities because so many things</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been conspired and were pulled off</v>

1883
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:25.770
<v Speaker 3>throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a common thread throughout</v>

1884
01:21:25.771 --> 01:21:29.340
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is when you're looking</v>

1885
01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:33.240
<v Speaker 3>at things today like towers falling and</v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings catching on fire and</v>

1886
01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:36.660
<v Speaker 3>collapsing and all these conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 3>get thrown around,</v>

1887
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you will lose a massive amount of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life watching youtube videos and reading</v>

1888
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:43.750
<v Speaker 3>websites.</v>

1889
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:46.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever six taking down rabbit holes</v>

1890
01:21:46.171 --> 01:21:49.110
<v Speaker 3>and websites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think dedicated to the nine 11</v>

1891
01:21:49.111 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1892
01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.350
<v Speaker 3>that's a small number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1893
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.020
<v Speaker 3>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where people</v>

1894
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:59.130
<v Speaker 3>don't want to see both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to see both sides of it.</v>

1895
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I feel like for sure there was some</v>
<v Speaker 3>incompetency for sure.</v>

1896
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 3>There was some failure to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>

1897
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether that was an intelligence failure</v>

1898
01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1899
01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were some,</v>

1900
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:18.360
<v Speaker 3>there was some failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1901
01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 3>and that allowed that whole thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1902
01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when any fun,</v>

1903
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.550
<v Speaker 3>when anything happens throughout</v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1904
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 3>there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one,</v>

1905
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:30.060
<v Speaker 3>there's two primary things that happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>when something goes down.</v>

1906
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Number one is people capitalize on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's an enormous event,</v>

1907
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:37.880
<v Speaker 3>there's something that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get attacked and you know,</v>

1908
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.780
<v Speaker 3>they know what happens and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1909
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:42.510
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this moment now in time,</v>

1910
01:22:42.511 --> 01:22:44.820
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have this potential to do</v>

1911
01:22:44.821 --> 01:22:48.450
<v Speaker 3>things they couldn't do before because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mood of the country has shifted.</v>

1912
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.200
<v Speaker 3>The mood is on revenge movies on</v>
<v Speaker 3>preventative measures,</v>

1913
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:55.320
<v Speaker 3>and then you can do things like go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and invade Iraq.</v>

1914
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:58.230
<v Speaker 3>That's a hundred percent fact that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is why they did that.</v>

1915
01:22:58.231 --> 01:23:00.510
<v Speaker 3>They did not do that cause they thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>our rack was going to attack us.</v>

1916
01:23:00.511 --> 01:23:03.630
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know the weapons of mass</v>

1917
01:23:03.631 --> 01:23:05.140
<v Speaker 3>destruction was all horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1918
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 3>So the whole reason why they did is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>look okay,</v>

1919
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 3>we've got a tag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the good side we've got a fucking</v>

1920
01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:14.050
<v Speaker 3>nice chance to go to Iraq here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the people that are looking and</v>

1921
01:23:14.051 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all start to add things.</v>

1922
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:22.060
<v Speaker 3>So they'll start to say they engineered</v>
<v Speaker 3>those attacks so they could go to Iraq.</v>

1923
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:26.290
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily true and way up</v>
<v Speaker 3>way unlikely.</v>

1924
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It's also giving the government or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>group of people,</v>

1925
01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:32.560
<v Speaker 3>a lot of credit for organizing being</v>
<v Speaker 3>that organizations and people keeping</v>

1926
01:23:32.561 --> 01:23:33.080
<v Speaker 3>their mouth shut.</v>

1927
01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1928
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Government incompetence and random</v>

1929
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:41.680
<v Speaker 3>events and momentum are probably the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason a lot of things that things</v>

1930
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:43.810
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People do have agendas.</v>

1931
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I do think there was a group of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had an agenda that wanted to take</v>

1932
01:23:47.921 --> 01:23:49.480
<v Speaker 3>out the fourth largest army in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1933
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq because Iraq was posed a threat.</v>

1934
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:54.340
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1935
01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people probably got into the</v>

1936
01:23:56.651 --> 01:24:01.150
<v Speaker 3>decision makers ear like George W.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush and not a very wise guy.</v>

1937
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1938
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 3>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were people that influenced,</v>

1939
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I think the invasion of Iraq who were</v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter than the decision makers.</v>

1940
01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I,</v>

1941
01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks had a great bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fourth largest army in the world thing.</v>

1942
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:14.621
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1943
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:17.760
<v Speaker 3>but after the first three armies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real big dropoff.</v>

1944
01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1945
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fifth largest army is a salvation</v>

1946
01:24:21.851 --> 01:24:22.490
<v Speaker 3>army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1947
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the one of the right main</v>

1948
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:29.650
<v Speaker 3>reason after nine 11 was the idea was</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go into Iraq to show any other</v>

1949
01:24:29.651 --> 01:24:31.150
<v Speaker 3>country like Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>

1950
01:24:31.151 --> 01:24:36.151
<v Speaker 3>that if they think there's any value in</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving a weapon of mass destruction to</v>

1951
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:39.750
<v Speaker 3>an enemy like Okaydo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it'll be the end of their country.</v>

1952
01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Here's appears proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1953
01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.150
<v Speaker 3>there was certainly probably a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of that,</v>

1954
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 3>but also oil money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oil was a big factor.</v>

1955
01:24:46.631 --> 01:24:50.450
<v Speaker 3>The ability to sort of engineer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>control the environment of budgets.</v>

1956
01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Engineering Control Lid was on lesson</v>

1957
01:24:52.911 --> 01:24:53.201
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>

1958
01:24:53.201 --> 01:24:53.681
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1959
01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:56.100
<v Speaker 3>because other than that doesn't hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>water because the oil,</v>

1960
01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:01.030
<v Speaker 3>there was money in a war effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but oil is a commodity traded on the</v>

1961
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 3>open market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you actually look at the way oil</v>

1962
01:25:02.921 --> 01:25:03.620
<v Speaker 3>is traded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1963
01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.060
<v Speaker 3>there's a a tanker with oil and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

1964
01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1965
01:25:08.351 --> 01:25:13.351
<v Speaker 3>it's an attack on an oil tanker can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>on its way to a country and then it's</v>

1966
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.430
<v Speaker 3>that tanker is bought by a broker and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to turn course and go back to</v>

1967
01:25:18.431 --> 01:25:21.340
<v Speaker 3>another place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So oil is traded on the open world</v>

1968
01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:22.090
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1969
01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:25.210
<v Speaker 3>there's oil that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of the United States wanted</v>

1970
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:29.650
<v Speaker 3>to control the Iraqi oil is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>bogus because we lost a shitload of</v>

1971
01:25:29.651 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 3>money and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't get that oil money.</v>

1972
01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:36.560
<v Speaker 3>We also produce enough of our own oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>with fracking and things to always</v>

1973
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.420
<v Speaker 3>support it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:25:37.421 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 3>No we didn't done but let's look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hold on a second.</v>

1975
01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:44.701
<v Speaker 3>Cause look at it practically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does Iraq hold fucking untold billions</v>

1976
01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.023
<v Speaker 3>of gallons of oil?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And isn't it a great idea to be in</v>

1978
01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 3>control of a place that has billions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>gallons of oil?</v>

1979
01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Aren't we in control of Iraq to invade</v>
<v Speaker 3>and overthrow their government?</v>

1980
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:57.550
<v Speaker 3>We did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not in control of it.</v>

1981
01:25:57.551 --> 01:25:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we're not in control,</v>

1982
01:25:58.631 --> 01:26:01.750
<v Speaker 3>but we essentially overthrew their</v>
<v Speaker 3>government and then gave control to</v>

1983
01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:03.770
<v Speaker 3>other people if we decide to take it</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1984
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 3>If there was some sort of an event in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States decided to go in and</v>

1985
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.740
<v Speaker 3>take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1986
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:11.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going into North Korea.</v>

1987
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're going into some</v>
<v Speaker 3>established country with a powerful army</v>

1988
01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 3>like Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1989
01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:18.530
<v Speaker 3>they're going into some thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially broke down.</v>

1990
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 3>We broke down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created a civil war between two rival</v>

1991
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 3>factions of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which nobody even predicted.</v>

1992
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea you'd be new about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>area a lot more than a lot of people</v>

1993
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 3>that we're talking about it because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up there.</v>

1994
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember you talking to me about that.</v>

1995
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 3>I remember you explained to me at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between the Shia and the</v>

1996
01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Sunni and that these people do not</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking get along.</v>

1997
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 3>And this is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it's a sodom was same guy being</v>

1998
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:44.360
<v Speaker 3>a psychopath and a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>

1999
01:26:44.361 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 3>He was also a nonreligious person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2000
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.220
<v Speaker 3>And because he was secular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of bathurst is essentially</v>

2001
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:54.320
<v Speaker 3>essentially mean as much as you can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>to exist in that area,</v>

2002
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.450
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because of that,</v>

2003
01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kind of like controlled those people</v>

2004
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 3>from going after each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my point being is there's a lot of</v>

2005
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:06.470
<v Speaker 3>fucking money to be made in Iraq in oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

2006
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that that wasn't some form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of motivation and how we see,</v>

2007
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.050
<v Speaker 3>we see these conversations that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

2008
01:27:12.051 --> 01:27:13.540
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things about these wiki</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaks,</v>

2009
01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:15.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>documents that you get.</v>

2010
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.660
<v Speaker 3>You get to see the connections at some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these people have with arms sales and</v>

2011
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Speaker 3>with donations to the Clinton Foundation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with oil and big money,</v>

2012
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 3>big money and so much wanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>reconstruction,</v>

2013
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 3>big money in weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big money in oil drilling.</v>

2014
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 3>There's big money in all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's got their hand in the</v>

2015
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Pie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's,</v>

2016
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.570
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what happens is,</v>

2017
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have other countries,</v>

2018
01:27:40.641 --> 01:27:42.470
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Pakistan.</v>

2019
01:27:42.471 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan has dizzy or I love the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that Pakistan has zero interest in</v>

2020
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:50.860
<v Speaker 3>having a peaceful Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even say that France falls</v>

2021
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 3>without making phone calls if you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough phones.</v>

2022
01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then you have other countries like</v>

2023
01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.050
<v Speaker 3>that that have less of an interest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping that country stable.</v>

2024
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:04.970
<v Speaker 3>So they foster conflict by supporting</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal networks,</v>

2025
01:28:04.971 --> 01:28:08.930
<v Speaker 3>by supporting other vested interest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>those country,</v>

2026
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:11.030
<v Speaker 3>keep those country's in turmoil.</v>

2027
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.000
<v Speaker 3>And then you have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2028
01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:14.780
<v Speaker 3>and the biggest issue with Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2029
01:28:14.781 --> 01:28:16.700
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to get into a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

2030
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.930
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Iraq invasion,</v>

2031
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:23.240
<v Speaker 3>2003 was good for Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made Iran a bigger player,</v>

2032
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:28.390
<v Speaker 3>probably made Russia more influential</v>
<v Speaker 3>and certainly made the Shia in Iraq,</v>

2033
01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:34.180
<v Speaker 3>the people that finally had some power</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had control of oil over the Sunni</v>

2034
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:36.840
<v Speaker 3>minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

2035
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:37.930
<v Speaker 3>remember what the British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>British,</v>

2036
01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.100
<v Speaker 3>British used to always do this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The British would go into,</v>

2037
01:28:40.101 --> 01:28:41.830
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Syria and things like that,</v>

2038
01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 3>that the Alawites in Syria are empower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Alawites are a minority.</v>

2039
01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:50.600
<v Speaker 3>That's what Bashar Al Assad is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe the Alawites are Shia</v>

2040
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.230
<v Speaker 3>where majority of the country is Sunni.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it might be the other way</v>

2041
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the British always would go into a</v>

2042
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 3>country when they would take over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of colonize a country and they'd</v>

2043
01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 3>find them minority and they would give</v>
<v Speaker 3>that minority</v>

2044
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 1>a lot of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here was the genius of that.</v>

2045
01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.950
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would prop them up and because now</v>

2046
01:29:07.951 --> 01:29:12.951
<v Speaker 1>the minority in that country had to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyal to the British because if they</v>

2047
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:14.750
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

2048
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:19.870
<v Speaker 1>if they chose to now kind of side with</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of a revolution side with any</v>

2049
01:29:20.371 --> 01:29:24.930
<v Speaker 1>kind of an independence movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minority also knew that once that</v>

2050
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.290
<v Speaker 1>was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority that they had been</v>

2051
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:33.390
<v Speaker 1>suppressing that they had been given</v>
<v Speaker 1>favor over would then turn on them.</v>

2052
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So that was always a way of dividing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquering.</v>

2053
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Find who the minority in the country is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go ahead and give them power so that</v>

2054
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.340
<v Speaker 1>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will have to be loyal to us because</v>

2055
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:49.560
<v Speaker 1>they're survivable will depend on it.</v>

2056
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been really bizarre moments in</v>

2057
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 2>history where leaders have actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplated how to keep the population</v>

2058
01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:57.540
<v Speaker 2>under control in the event that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no war.</v>

2059
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:00.930
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the big fears is the event</v>
<v Speaker 2>that peace breaks out.</v>

2060
01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one of the reasons why they</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed the,</v>

2061
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:05.610
<v Speaker 2>the game of football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2062
01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.450
<v Speaker 2>they made football to deal with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people weren't going to war.</v>

2063
01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:12.930
<v Speaker 2>And you had all these young men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were ready to fuck a girl to kick</v>

2064
01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:15.000
<v Speaker 2>some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was no ass to keck.</v>

2065
01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had conquered America.</v>

2066
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:20.520
<v Speaker 2>They had wiped out all the native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans and put them into reservations</v>

2067
01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:23.610
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a sort of unspoken war.</v>

2068
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:26.700
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the wars with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>British and the wars with the Spa</v>

2069
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Spanish and all this different shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>went on for how many hundreds of years.</v>

2070
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'll throw out the question men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that?</v>

2071
01:30:34.161 --> 01:30:36.320
<v Speaker 1>The great article a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name,</v>

2072
01:30:36.321 --> 01:30:37.910
<v Speaker 1>but he wrote an article goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2073
01:30:37.911 --> 01:30:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I never trust anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't been punched in the face.</v>

2074
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization is an agreement among men</v>

2075
01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.440
<v Speaker 1>to behave well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2076
01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:49.670
<v Speaker 1>when you got civilization it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at the simulated violence at</v>

2077
01:30:49.671 --> 01:30:53.330
<v Speaker 1>all of us have to engage in I at 49</v>
<v Speaker 1>going box,</v>

2078
01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:55.460
<v Speaker 1>look at the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never miss a fight.</v>

2079
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2080
01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2081
01:30:58.010 --> 01:31:01.070
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mma,</v>

2082
01:31:01.071 --> 01:31:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this is one of the fastest</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing sports among young men all over</v>

2083
01:31:04.491 --> 01:31:05.420
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2084
01:31:05.421 --> 01:31:08.480
<v Speaker 1>it's surprising when you see two men</v>
<v Speaker 1>should kill each other with their bare</v>

2085
01:31:08.481 --> 01:31:10.070
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are triggers.</v>

2086
01:31:10.071 --> 01:31:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Visual triggers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same as like with pornography,</v>

2087
01:31:13.190 --> 01:31:14.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just visual triggers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2088
01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.690
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that taps into my caveman there.</v>

2089
01:31:17.691 --> 01:31:19.460
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:22.360

2122
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:34.990
<v Speaker 3>center of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2123
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe put yourself last in all</v>
<v Speaker 3>categories.</v>

2124
01:32:37.361 --> 01:32:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be good.</v>

2125
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this unempowering.</v>

2126
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the way you think.</v>

2127
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2128
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.550
<v Speaker 3>but we live in a world where it says</v>
<v Speaker 3>self my kids,</v>

2129
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fucking yell at the school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not that important.</v>

2130
01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Your dreams are going to important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike kids went down there to get an</v>

2131
01:32:49.781 --> 01:32:52.810
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to be taught by some fucking 49 year</v>

2132
01:32:52.811 --> 01:32:54.250
<v Speaker 3>old burn out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not in Paul.</v>

2133
01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 3>But he looks a lot younger than 49.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got tight fitting skin from a</v>

2134
01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:58.920
<v Speaker 3>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a distance,</v>

2135
01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:02.140
<v Speaker 3>from a homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about getting old.</v>

2136
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>

2137
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:04.500
<v Speaker 3>You're getting old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why training.</v>

2138
01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.610
<v Speaker 3>That's why I do my yoga has no getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>around it buddy.</v>

2139
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>

2140
01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we saw it a lot of the problems</v>

2141
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we solve shit and I don't</v>

2142
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:17.320
<v Speaker 3>think this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world's perspective is a lot</v>

2143
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:19.660
<v Speaker 3>like my lego pile that I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2144
01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Little tiny legos get put on all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and sometimes we have to take legos</v>

2145
01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 3>off sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we've created areas of protection</v>

2146
01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:27.970
<v Speaker 3>where we don't really need any</v>
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>

2147
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:29.830
<v Speaker 3>The big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big one being humor.</v>

2148
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I can people try to dissect humor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend that these are actual</v>

2149
01:33:32.711 --> 01:33:34.810
<v Speaker 3>statements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're giving a fucking affidavit</v>

2150
01:33:34.811 --> 01:33:37.810
<v Speaker 3>in court or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people say ridiculous things.</v>

2151
01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:40.360
<v Speaker 3>They don't really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you laugh at them cause you</v>

2152
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:42.160
<v Speaker 3>know they don't really mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2153
01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you're allowed to get</v>

2154
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:48.280
<v Speaker 3>triggered by these things and you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to protest to get upset.</v>

2155
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a symptom of us being too</v>

2156
01:33:51.371 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 3>soft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a symptom of life being too soft</v>

2157
01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 3>and gentle snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't agree more fragile</v>

2158
01:33:57.011 --> 01:34:00.100
<v Speaker 3>snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't agree more so scared but get</v>

2159
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 3>some perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2160
01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:06.250
<v Speaker 3>they can't so much worse if shit went</v>
<v Speaker 3>down just like it did on nine 11 then</v>

2161
01:34:06.251 --> 01:34:09.920
<v Speaker 3>you get this beautiful community of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are happy and,</v>

2162
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:13.480
<v Speaker 3>and truly thankful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost like shit has to go down</v>

2163
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:17.350
<v Speaker 3>for us to remember or you've got to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something really hard.</v>

2164
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the great things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about exercise.</v>

2165
01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll come out of a workout and</v>

2166
01:34:22.751 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hug people.</v>

2167
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I just love endorphin trying to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2168

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm high as fuck on endorphins and on</v>

2169
01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:35.290
<v Speaker 3>top of the endorphin thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also like just a release of stress</v>

2170
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.820
<v Speaker 3>and it's working out is so difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that when it is over,</v>

2171
01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.170
<v Speaker 3>like you have this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2172
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 3>like the struggle of a peak training</v>
<v Speaker 3>session.</v>

2173
01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you're doing rounds on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bag right and you know you're going to</v>

2174
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 3>do seven rounds in the bag and you hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fourth round and you are fucking</v>

2175
01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:55.820
<v Speaker 3>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2176
01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have do three more rounds and you</v>

2177
01:34:58.761 --> 01:34:59.210
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2178
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 3>you've got to go have to go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when it's,</v>

2179
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:04.520
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to do when you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment when your pr you're heaving and</v>

2180
01:35:04.521 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at the clock and is still</v>
<v Speaker 3>a minute and 45 to go and you're,</v>

2181
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 3>and you're just breathing fire and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to pace yourself.</v>

2182
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 3>That's so much more difficult than</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

2183
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Then once you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else is like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can't even grow coke in North</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2231
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:07.183
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>

2232
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:09.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can't be grown in the United</v>

2233
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.110
<v Speaker 3>States Google if that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if that's true,</v>

2234
01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:15.890
<v Speaker 3>I've been repeating that all my life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I got it from an ice tea</v>

2235
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:16.724
<v Speaker 3>song.</v>

2236
01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.580
<v Speaker 3>My really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my feeling is talking about conspiracy.</v>

2237
01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure with that kind of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably people that are border</v>

2238
01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 3>control and stuff or getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just too easy to let it through.</v>

2239
01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it's from the song high rollers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether it be a high roller,</v>

2240
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:38.300

2241
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:41.930
<v Speaker 3>but only in very limited areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Typically cocoa beans are grown in a</v>

2242
01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:45.200
<v Speaker 3>narrow band referred to as the coca belt</v>
<v Speaker 3>or chocolate belt.</v>

2243
01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 3>His band exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 20 degrees of latitude.</v>

01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:01.710
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why do you feel about marijuana use</v>

2282
01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:03.690
<v Speaker 3>and teenagers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's good idea,</v>

2283
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:05.060
<v Speaker 3>but I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 15.</v>

2285
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:10.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a good idea that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a growing mind cause I think that we'd</v>

2286
01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:14.550
<v Speaker 3>contend to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think thc is still an mind altering</v>

2287
01:39:14.551 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 3>substance and just like anything else</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has its benefits.</v>

2288
01:39:19.231 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 3>But I think as you're growing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like it can be for the most</v>

2289
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:25.080
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a young mind,</v>

2290
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 3>a motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keller it could be.</v>

2291
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of factors that</v>
<v Speaker 3>could play into the big picture of who</v>

2292
01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:34.980
<v Speaker 3>you become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly could be one of them to</v>

2293
01:39:34.981 --> 01:39:37.500
<v Speaker 3>deny that it's not influential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of silly.</v>

2294
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also to a really truly understand</v>

2295
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:43.740
<v Speaker 3>the effects of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2296
01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 3>the way thc if</v>

2297
01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.650
<v Speaker 2>affects the developing mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not completely understood and it's,</v>

2298
01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:51.800
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely under debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2299
01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.500
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of studies that have shown</v>

2300
01:39:53.501 --> 01:39:56.830
<v Speaker 2>that it's actually not bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a woman to be smoking it while her</v>

2301
01:39:56.831 --> 01:39:59.200
<v Speaker 2>baby's in the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really contrary to what a lot</v>

2302
01:39:59.201 --> 01:40:00.120
<v Speaker 2>of people think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2303
01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.210
<v Speaker 2>But whether or not it's beneficial for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>young kid,</v>

2304
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:06.580
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>

2305
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:08.753
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2306
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:13.510
<v Speaker 2>if you think of how old you are when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually are an adult,</v>

2307
01:40:13.511 --> 01:40:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have this number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2308
01:40:14.651 --> 01:40:17.800
<v Speaker 2>The numbers 18 right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your brain doesn't really fully</v>

2309
01:40:17.801 --> 01:40:21.160
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fully formed to your early</v>

2310
01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:21.940
<v Speaker 2>twenties right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of shit going on and if</v>

2312
01:40:24.221 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 2>you're altering</v>

2313
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:28.210
<v Speaker 3>nat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the consequences are,</v>

2314
01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm find why we have laws against</v>

2315
01:40:30.881 --> 01:40:33.500
<v Speaker 3>drinking when you're under aged or</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking,</v>

2316
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:35.770
<v Speaker 3>not all countries seeing other</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

2317
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:37.203
<v Speaker 3>they have</v>

2318
01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:42.010
<v Speaker 2>less instances of alcohol abuse per</v>
<v Speaker 2>capita because it's not this forbidden</v>

2319
01:40:42.011 --> 01:40:43.410
<v Speaker 2>taboo thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2320
01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:47.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a real argument for that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that kids don't like being told what</v>

2321
01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:51.220
<v Speaker 2>to do and when you can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends and someone sneaks a little</v>

2322
01:40:51.221 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking flask of whiskey and we all</v>
<v Speaker 2>around drinking in our</v>

2323
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.240
<v Speaker 3>clubhouse like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2324
01:40:55.241 --> 01:40:56.720
<v Speaker 3>we're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

2325
01:40:56.770 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 3>if it was legal and easy to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might not be so inclined to do that.</v>

2326
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.890
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno either.</v>

2327
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:05.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know France doesn't have the same</v>

2328
01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:06.280
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Russia does.</v>

2329
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Russia being Russia and wouldn't be that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

2330
01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:10.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are winters,</v>

2331
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.060
<v Speaker 3>the winters and the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2332
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:16.960
<v Speaker 3>they got conquered by the Mongols for</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 fucking years also being run by it.</v>

2333
01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.250
<v Speaker 3>You also being controlled by the czar</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now and putting some,</v>

2334
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:21.280
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a terrifying person.</v>

2335
01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:26.020
<v Speaker 3>They keep fucking shooting guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>know a lot about Russian doping for the</v>

2336
01:41:26.021 --> 01:41:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Olympics to keep shooting these dope and</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists and journalists.</v>

2337
01:41:29.411 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the doping scientists,</v>

2338
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:33.010
<v Speaker 3>they're dropping like flies and didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay attention to that.</v>

2339
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2340
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 3>There you got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a conspiracy.</v>

2341
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real one.</v>

2342
01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:41:37.650 --> 01:41:39.460

<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2344
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 3>They know too much and they're being</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken Russian intelligence.</v>

2345
01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poisoning you with odorless,</v>

2346
01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.450
<v Speaker 3>tasteless substances that the KGB is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good at,</v>

2347
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.460
<v Speaker 3>or the fsm or whatever it's called now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2348
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 3>and now apparently putting is revamping</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intelligence [inaudible] DOMESTICA</v>

2349
01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 3>intelligence agency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Putin knows that.</v>

2350
01:41:58.271 --> 01:42:01.540
<v Speaker 3>We know he has botox on his forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that he did.</v>

2351
01:42:01.541 --> 01:42:04.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to admit or deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as the way to shiny.</v>

2352
01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an old lady at the beauty</v>

2353
01:42:06.881 --> 01:42:09.070
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this journalist that wrote an</v>

2354
01:42:09.071 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 3>article in 2012 about him.</v>

2355
01:42:11.771 --> 01:42:13.440
<v Speaker 3>harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she basically,</v>

2356
01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about a gutsy woman.</v>

2359
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.600
<v Speaker 3>What Putin is is like a throwback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's got a good sense of like the way he</v>

2362

<v Speaker 3>classified,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2365
01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Like the guys is running the country by</v>

<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love trump too.</v>

2375
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:05.140

<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2376
01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.960
<v Speaker 3>the 80% approval rating is probably a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot like Kim Jong.</v>

2377
01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Ooh and shout a hundred percent approval</v>
<v Speaker 3>rating.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like the choices.</v>

2379
01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that to governor pence.</v>

2382
01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's running mate,</v>

01:43:22.601 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 3>You can't deny it's a strong leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Garry Kasparov said,</v>

2386
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Mister [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mister pence,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Putin is a strong leader is like saying</v>

2388
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.960
<v Speaker 3>arsenic is a strong drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your country should be ashamed of you.</v>

2389
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't agree more because you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to know the difference.</v>

2390
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:41.050
<v Speaker 3>You didn't need to know that when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about a strong leader,</v>

2391
01:43:41.051 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 3>a strong man in that context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're really talking about is a</v>

2392
01:43:43.391 --> 01:43:46.240
<v Speaker 3>man who thinks he's above the</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions of that country.</v>

2393
01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:49.930
<v Speaker 3>He's above the rule of law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are at his whim and what a strong</v>

2394
01:43:49.931 --> 01:43:51.160
<v Speaker 3>men do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll create.</v>

2395
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.500
<v Speaker 3>As long as you give me all your money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll create security.</v>

2396
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 3>As long as you give me all your freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll create security as long as you say</v>

2397
01:43:57.381 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 3>nothing bad about me.</v>

2398
01:43:58.790 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 3>What was that Dan Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my favorite quote,</v>

2399
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 3>they Romans created a wasteland and</v>
<v Speaker 3>called it peace.</v>

2400
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia is a one crop economy.</v>

2401
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.560
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time you bought a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian?</v>

2402
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me one thing.</v>

2403
01:44:09.501 --> 01:44:11.330
<v Speaker 3>You ever buy a restaurant up here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is from Russia.</v>

2404
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Russian car rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rush,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2406
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know nanotechnology by those big</v>

2407
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:20.150
<v Speaker 3>hats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of hats with the flaps that come</v>

2408
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:21.350
<v Speaker 3>down the side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vodka.</v>

2409
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 3>She isn't even that good anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make it better.</v>

2410
01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:26.000
<v Speaker 3>So we'd make us better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got to dare you.</v>

2411
01:44:26.001 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oil.</v>

2412
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2413
01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2414
01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 3>His pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's also this game that</v>

2415
01:44:32.931 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 3>that pence guy has to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2416
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:37.820
<v Speaker 3>he's been playing the small time</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics game now he's going global.</v>

2417
01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this game that this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to play where he has to say Nice</v>

2418
01:44:42.351 --> 01:44:46.010
<v Speaker 3>things about people that Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>has said nice things about,</v>

2419
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump has said that he's a fan of</v>

2420
01:44:48.441 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Putin.</v>

2421
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Gates.</v>

2422
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Gates.</v>

2423
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 3>You know Robert Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was secretary of defense,</v>

2424
01:44:53.421 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 3>who served eight presidents over 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2425
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert,</v>

2426
01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:58.461
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Gates,</v>

2427
01:44:58.461 --> 01:45:00.800
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wrote an article in the New York Times.</v>

2428
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:03.380
<v Speaker 3>This is a guy who served Republican</v>
<v Speaker 3>administrations.</v>

2429
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Look up Robert Gates for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2430
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Look at this art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2431
01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.910
<v Speaker 3>I know it says Mike Pence as it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>inarguable that Putin is a stronger</v>

2432
01:45:10.911 --> 01:45:12.180
<v Speaker 3>leader than Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in.</v>

2433
01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:13.670
<v Speaker 3>He's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2434
01:45:13.671 --> 01:45:14.060
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2435
01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.640
<v Speaker 3>you're an ignorant miss when you say</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are irresponsible.</v>

2436
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Robert Gates said that Donald Trump is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only unfit but dangerous for the</v>

2437
01:45:22.371 --> 01:45:25.180
<v Speaker 3>defense of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has zero idea,</v>

2438
01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 3>the nuances that go into geopolitics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it takes.</v>

2439
01:45:27.831 --> 01:45:29.330
<v Speaker 3>He's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked,</v>

2440
01:45:29.331 --> 01:45:31.670
<v Speaker 3>he operates on his gut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his gut level,</v>

2441
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:35.120
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the guy isn't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in knowing what he doesn't</v>

2442
01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:37.070
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's telling me fried chicken with a</v>

2443
01:45:37.071 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 3>fork and knife.</v>

2444
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Can't stand him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some collar with mom.</v>

2445
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't like Hillary either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be honest because I'm more of a</v>

2446
01:45:41.691 --> 01:45:42.740
<v Speaker 3>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'll taste thing.</v>

2447
01:45:42.741 --> 01:45:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an EGOMANIAC and I think he's</v>

2448
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:47.150
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beyond repair,</v>

2449
01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.050
<v Speaker 3>do you think that he thought that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>was ever going to really work out this</v>

2450
01:45:51.051 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he would actually be the Republican</v>

2451
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 3>nominee?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Question.</v>

2452
01:45:53.631 --> 01:45:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Unless he was doing it for his own</v>
<v Speaker 3>brand.</v>

2453
01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:56.960
<v Speaker 3>I can see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so,</v>

2454
01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:00.530
<v Speaker 3>everything comes back to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about him,</v>

2455
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about him.</v>

2456
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:04.980
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't be surprised if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2457
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:05.840
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run.</v>

2458
01:46:05.841 --> 01:46:08.570
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be good for my brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get make me more famous,</v>

2459
01:46:08.571 --> 01:46:11.360
<v Speaker 3>which is all he's ever been interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in seams and it'll be,</v>

2460
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 3>it'll be good for my company and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2461
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:14.840
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden he went and hold on</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2462
01:46:14.841 --> 01:46:16.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually going to do this.</v>

2463
01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:18.680
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think he wants to work that</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

2464
01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 3>The presidency of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a hard thing to,</v>

2465
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that he has a ton of</v>

2466
01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:26.240
<v Speaker 3>obligations always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2467
01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:30.050
<v Speaker 3>And I assume all those obligations make</v>
<v Speaker 3>him a substantial amount of money.</v>

2468
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Unlike being the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president is not a substantial</v>

2469
01:46:33.741 --> 01:46:37.670
<v Speaker 3>amount of money in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in well you names like after the fact</v>

2470
01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.680
<v Speaker 3>put his money and he put his company in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a trust under his kid's name and that's</v>

2471
01:46:42.681 --> 01:46:44.530
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the issue.</v>

2472
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:47.870
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you really think he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>step away from everything and run the</v>

2473
01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 3>country for half a million bucks a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2474
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good question.</v>

2475
01:46:52.411 --> 01:46:56.700
<v Speaker 3>400 president has earned $400,000 annual</v>
<v Speaker 3>salary along with a $50,000 annual</v>

2476
01:46:56.701 --> 01:47:00.180
<v Speaker 3>expense account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a $100,000 non taxable travel account</v>

2477
01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:03.040
<v Speaker 3>and the $19,000 for entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2478
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,000 a year from entertainment.</v>

2479
01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spend a lot more than the most recent</v>

2480
01:47:07.441 --> 01:47:09.780
<v Speaker 3>raisins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salary was approved by Congress and</v>

2481
01:47:09.781 --> 01:47:14.781
<v Speaker 3>President Bill Clinton in 1999 went into</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect in 2001 so Clinton was balling.</v>

2482
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:19.170
<v Speaker 3>How convenient that motherfucker ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you wanted that 400 grand,</v>

2483
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 3>400 grand back then was probably a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>

2484
01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I think Sam Harris Today on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts did a great job of describing</v>

2485
01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2486
01:47:26.250 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's ever said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2487
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.580
<v Speaker 3>and I've listened to everything he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2488
01:47:30.581 --> 01:47:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I tried to listen to the speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to listen to these interviews and</v>

2489
01:47:33.871 --> 01:47:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that Donald Trump has ever</v>

2490
01:47:36.631 --> 01:47:40.080
<v Speaker 3>sent anything profound or insightful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard him say even anything</v>

2491
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:44.370
<v Speaker 3>substansive about what he would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about major challenges in this country</v>

2492
01:47:44.371 --> 01:47:45.960
<v Speaker 3>other than the fact that he would build</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wall.</v>

2493
01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Very general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck with that.</v>

2494
01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2495
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 3>and get tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He get tough on law and order.</v>

2496
01:47:51.511 --> 01:47:53.640
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get tough luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Demagogues,</v>

2497
01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 3>all demagogues in history always talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about law and order and how we have to</v>

2498
01:47:57.121 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 3>get tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is another way of saying,</v>

2499
01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:01.950
<v Speaker 3>give me more power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me more guns.</v>

2500
01:48:01.951 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to keep things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to enforce the law because</v>

2501
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:09.981
<v Speaker 3>apparently our cities are hell holes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not true.</v>

2502
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:13.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cities have become places where a</v>

2503
01:48:13.351 --> 01:48:16.560
<v Speaker 3>lot of people go and they've never been</v>
<v Speaker 3>safer in the history of this country,</v>

2504
01:48:16.561 --> 01:48:17.730
<v Speaker 3>in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2505
01:48:17.731 --> 01:48:18.840
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2506
01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:23.340
<v Speaker 3>this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got lots of sensationalist things</v>

2507
01:48:23.341 --> 01:48:25.620
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's very little substance long</v>

2508
01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:28.230
<v Speaker 3>unstylish short on substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's always been that guy.</v>

2509
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.620
<v Speaker 3>That's his whole marketing campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2510
01:48:31.621 --> 01:48:33.750
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a salesman.</v>

2511
01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.270
<v Speaker 3>He sells himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts his name everywhere.</v>

2512
01:48:36.271 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 3>He brands things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got this,</v>

2513
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 3>this look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wears nice suits.</v>

2514
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to look even with his hair.</v>

2515
01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows he could cut his hair better</v>

2516
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:44.820
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2517
01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 3>he does that shit on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does that shit because he knows it's</v>

2518
01:48:48.511 --> 01:48:51.300
<v Speaker 3>like his whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His whole thing is just the whole</v>

2519
01:48:51.301 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 3>wackiness of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:48:53.371 --> 01:48:57.750
<v Speaker 3>But my issue becomes more about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people say he's got to be smart</v>

2521
01:48:57.751 --> 01:48:59.280
<v Speaker 3>because he made a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2522
01:48:59.670 --> 01:49:04.530
<v Speaker 3>So we extrapolate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make these sort of large claims and</v>

2523
01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:05.760
<v Speaker 3>even I would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2524
01:49:05.761 --> 01:49:07.680
<v Speaker 3>he's an entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does run a company.</v>

2525
01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.280
<v Speaker 3>He has created some value in his brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did have luxury apartment.</v>

2526
01:49:11.281 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 3>When I think of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of Nice hotels and nice</v>

2527
01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:15.170
<v Speaker 3>apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to take everything away</v>

2528
01:49:15.171 --> 01:49:15.840
<v Speaker 3>from him.</v>

2529
01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:18.360
<v Speaker 3>He's had mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Entrepreneurs make mistakes.</v>

2530
01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:21.150
<v Speaker 3>So I don't begrudge them that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2531
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 3>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this becomes a problem with that</v>

2532
01:49:25.021 --> 01:49:27.630
<v Speaker 3>word smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you just decide this</v>

2533
01:49:27.631 --> 01:49:28.920
<v Speaker 3>person's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gotta be smart.</v>

2534
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 3>This person's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's smart,</v>

2535
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:31.490
<v Speaker 3>he's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he tried like,</v>

2536
01:49:31.491 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got 130 Iq.</v>

2537
01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really good at problem solving.</v>

2538
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>How good are you socially?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2539
01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:39.490
<v Speaker 3>how good are you understanding people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How good a conversationalist are you?</v>

2540
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:41.840
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of variables when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what is smart,</v>

2541
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:46.350
<v Speaker 3>what's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that guy is fairly good at</v>

2542
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:48.060
<v Speaker 3>making fuckloads of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2543
01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:51.510
<v Speaker 3>He's fairly good at running casinos and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hotels and restaurants is in menial</v>

2544
01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:55.900
<v Speaker 3>things fall apart and drop and you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people lose money.</v>

2545
01:49:55.901 --> 01:49:58.360
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of ups and downs when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to business.</v>

2546
01:49:58.361 --> 01:50:00.430
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's flying around in jets.</v>

2547
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:01.930
<v Speaker 3>He's got big houses and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2548
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of success there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he lost all of his money</v>

2549
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.360
<v Speaker 3>and he's poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He inherited about $200 million in,</v>

2550
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:10.270
<v Speaker 3>had it whole apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including lawyers and political</v>

2551
01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:11.690
<v Speaker 3>connections in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he'd,</v>

2552
01:50:11.691 --> 01:50:12.240
<v Speaker 3>he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2553
01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:12.781
<v Speaker 3>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2554
01:50:12.781 --> 01:50:14.730
<v Speaker 3>what I see that with a number of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 millions,</v>

2555
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:17.500
<v Speaker 3>but he had money before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get inherited that money.</v>

2556
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:20.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before he was given like 2 million bucks</v>

2557
01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:22.810
<v Speaker 3>by his parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his alone start at first.</v>

2558
01:50:22.811 --> 01:50:26.230
<v Speaker 3>But this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father was a huge developer and he'd</v>

2559
01:50:26.231 --> 01:50:29.200
<v Speaker 3>always followed his father around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father was a giant developer in New</v>

2560
01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.330
<v Speaker 3>York and he inherited essentially not</v>
<v Speaker 3>only,</v>

2561
01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:34.360
<v Speaker 3>not only the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the political apparatus to</v>

2562
01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 3>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2563
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:37.450
<v Speaker 3>so much of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trump's,</v>

2564
01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he bought so many of those</v>

2565
01:50:39.671 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 3>buildings in New York and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the center of his empire,</v>

2566
01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:46.690
<v Speaker 3>15 buildings in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bought those buildings and he got</v>

2567
01:50:46.691 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 3>huge tax breaks.</v>

2568
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't begrudge that developers work</v>

2569
01:50:52.361 --> 01:50:55.000
<v Speaker 3>deals with the city and they get big tax</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks.</v>

2570
01:50:55.240 --> 01:51:00.240
<v Speaker 3>But remember a lot of those deals came</v>
<v Speaker 3>from deep inside political connections</v>

2571
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.170
<v Speaker 3>and connections to construction</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

2572
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 3>many of which were owned by gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way you do business in</v>

2573
01:51:08.921 --> 01:51:09.641
<v Speaker 3>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2574
01:51:09.641 --> 01:51:13.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't criticize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but please don't act as though you</v>

2575
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:18.661
<v Speaker 3>weren't using the political system and</v>
<v Speaker 3>greasing the political palms to get and</v>

2576
01:51:21.611 --> 01:51:25.480
<v Speaker 3>make and hold on to your money when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize other people.</v>

2577
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:27.910
<v Speaker 3>But it's kind of admitting that he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's saying he understands how the</v>

2578
01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:30.580
<v Speaker 3>system was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we was talking about how we went to</v>

2579
01:51:30.581 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton's wedding relate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he gave her money,</v>

2580
01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:35.110
<v Speaker 3>he gave her money and went to her</v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding.</v>

2581
01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great lived,</v>

2582
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:37.601
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2583
01:51:37.601 --> 01:51:38.950
<v Speaker 3>when you watch those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those debates,</v>

2584
01:51:38.951 --> 01:51:40.360
<v Speaker 3>he's really entertaining.</v>

2585
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:41.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is.</v>

2586
01:51:41.651 --> 01:51:42.820
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2587
01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 3>you can't begrudge people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's good to say that all</v>

2588
01:51:46.691 --> 01:51:48.900
<v Speaker 3>people that support trump are dumb or</v>
<v Speaker 3>rednecks.</v>

2589
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I think that's prejudice and ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that are really fed up</v>

2590
01:51:52.541 --> 01:51:55.930
<v Speaker 3>with the way things were working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The system democratic and Republican is</v>

2591
01:51:55.931 --> 01:51:59.050
<v Speaker 3>not working for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are a thousand reasons and</v>

2592
01:51:59.051 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 3>they're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least this guy speaking his mind and</v>

2593
01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.250
<v Speaker 3>he's just different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2594
01:52:03.251 --> 01:52:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but please man,</v>

2595
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:06.370
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2596
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 3>he's not the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus,</v>

2597
01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:09.130
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fun.</v>

2598
01:52:09.131 --> 01:52:11.050
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of fun when this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

2599
01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing fun for us to hang out</v>

2600
01:52:13.001 --> 01:52:13.691
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2601
01:52:13.691 --> 01:52:15.130
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2602
01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if we can be assured that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't being recorded,</v>

2603
01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 3>you could feel free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a couple of pops in him.</v>

2604
01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2605
01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:25.150
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a bunch of issues with</v>

2606
01:52:25.210 --> 01:52:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Clinton as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2607
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:30.370
<v Speaker 3>and you look at all the stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to her and all the people that</v>

2608
01:52:30.371 --> 01:52:34.280
<v Speaker 3>think that there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>her and what she represents and it's,</v>

2609
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 3>there's not one ideal choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2610
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jill Stein,</v>

2611
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:42.070
<v Speaker 3>who the Green Party candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just says that she thinks that 16</v>

2612
01:52:42.071 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 3>year old should be allowed to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

2613
01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2614

<v Speaker 3>they would vote for new UNICORNS and</v>

2615
01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Narnia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The children,</v>

2616
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.210
<v Speaker 3>they're teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teenagers shouldn't be able to decide</v>

2617
01:52:56.211 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 3>their friends or future of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2618
01:52:58.821 --> 01:53:01.310
<v Speaker 3>They're children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're living at home still like stop.</v>

2619
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:01.911
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2620
01:53:01.911 --> 01:53:03.500

<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so good.</v>

2622
01:53:05.970 --> 01:53:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I take about the way I thought when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was 25 versus now.</v>

2623
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean 16 I was such a monkey was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey.</v>

2624
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:16.020
<v Speaker 3>The idea that anybody could ask me any</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions other than wise,</v>

2625
01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.640
<v Speaker 3>my dick hard all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any answers.</v>

2626
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:21.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>

2627
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these people that are running for</v>

2628
01:53:23.301 --> 01:53:26.420
<v Speaker 3>president are all silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all silly people.</v>

2629
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:29.570
<v Speaker 3>You need like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally would need like a Sam</v>

2630
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Harris and then he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2631
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:36.140
<v Speaker 3>you'd need like a really smart guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be pragmatic about things and then</v>

2632
01:53:36.141 --> 01:53:37.880
<v Speaker 3>he could appoint people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified.</v>

2633
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to nominate Sam cause he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to do it.</v>

2634
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.240
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yam has his limits.</v>

2635
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:43.123
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>

2636
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.570
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting about Sam Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I there Sam Harris's that Sam's model</v>

2637
01:53:47.571 --> 01:53:52.430
<v Speaker 3>for human behavior and Sam's model for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way things should work is that</v>

2638
01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.860
<v Speaker 3>essentially people are rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2639
01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.910
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he'll cause his arguments for</v>

2640
01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.970
<v Speaker 3>against religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you listened to some of his speeches</v>

2641
01:53:58.971 --> 01:54:03.710
<v Speaker 3>are listen now are this is the problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

2642
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan Heit,</v>

2643
01:54:04.791 --> 01:54:08.570
<v Speaker 3>who's a great thinker and they had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate and Jonathan Heights' set that</v>

2644
01:54:08.571 --> 01:54:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>

2645
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:12.230
<v Speaker 3>you're a model for human beings.</v>

2646
01:54:12.230 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit outdated because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're assuming human minds are</v>

2647
01:54:15.051 --> 01:54:16.140
<v Speaker 3>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2648
01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.010
<v Speaker 3>human beings are intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are emotional.</v>

2649
01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.950
<v Speaker 3>And in fact we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're emotional and we will create</v>

2650
01:54:21.951 --> 01:54:24.980
<v Speaker 3>rationality around those impulses and</v>
<v Speaker 3>those emotions.</v>

2651
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:29.150
<v Speaker 3>So even he has his limitations on how</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings work.</v>

2652
01:54:29.151 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure we'd be criticizing his</v>
<v Speaker 3>point of view as well.</v>

2653
01:54:31.521 --> 01:54:34.010
<v Speaker 3>But I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop right there because that's a giant</v>

2654
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:36.320
<v Speaker 3>generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever someone says human beings are</v>

2655
01:54:36.321 --> 01:54:39.260
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant percentage of us that</v>

2656
01:54:39.261 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 3>are totally irrational and out of her</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind.</v>

2657
01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:44.480
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a percentage of us that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are rational and I shouldn't say us</v>

2658
01:54:44.481 --> 01:54:46.220
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm not necessarily sure I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational.</v>

2659
01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Our personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would like some parts of our,</v>

2660
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:50.590
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our personalities are rational parts.</v>

2661
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2662
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:52.131
<v Speaker 3>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2663
01:54:52.131 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I spar in case I get in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how insecure I am.</v>

2664
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I just want to be ready for an</v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginary scenario.</v>

2665
01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really,</v>

2666
01:55:01.581 --> 01:55:03.030
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you are,</v>

2667
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing my power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never had much anyway.</v>

2668
01:55:06.621 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 3>But do you lift weights?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2669
01:55:08.331 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I dead lift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you can't tell,</v>

2670
01:55:09.591 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 3>but dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to show you my lower back</v>

2671
01:55:11.391 --> 01:55:12.740
<v Speaker 3>and my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2672
01:55:12.741 --> 01:55:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked for my court.</v>

2673
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna look forward to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>

2674
01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.840
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now I feel like you're,</v>

2675
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:18.470
<v Speaker 3>when we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2676
01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:22.730
<v Speaker 3>just like someone generalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do this or people do that.</v>

2677
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I think people are absolutely capable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and I think they're wiser now</v>

2678
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.930
<v Speaker 3>than they were hundreds of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they believed unbelievably</v>

2679
01:55:29.931 --> 01:55:31.790
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that long.</v>

2680
01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.600
<v Speaker 3>It's such a short amount of time with</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far people have come.</v>

2681
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about earlier when</v>

2682
01:55:38.661 --> 01:55:41.630
<v Speaker 3>we first brought up this Matt Leblanc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frank putting in perspective the steps</v>

2683
01:55:41.631 --> 01:55:43.970
<v Speaker 3>that have been made and then the,</v>

2684
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 2>the progress that has been made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2685
01:55:46.330 --> 01:55:49.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange time because on one hand</v>

2686
01:55:49.921 --> 01:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you do have these really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really rational people that make some</v>

2687
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:55.230
<v Speaker 2>great points and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2688
01:55:55.231 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's hope for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's like when I send that</v>

2689
01:55:58.081 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 2>little building blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Lego's.</v>

2690
01:55:59.701 --> 01:56:04.200
<v Speaker 2>You put a little tiny lego layer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>layer lego's on with each little</v>

2691
01:56:04.201 --> 01:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>experience in each little of the way it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets interpreted by people and they add</v>

2692
01:56:07.981 --> 01:56:11.850
<v Speaker 2>up to things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our version of like what reality is</v>

2693
01:56:11.851 --> 01:56:14.460
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps changing and growing and</v>

2694
01:56:14.461 --> 01:56:16.920
<v Speaker 2>expanding and morphing as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2695
01:56:16.921 --> 01:56:21.360
<v Speaker 2>a 1930s movie depiction of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really all we have to go on.</v>

2696
01:56:21.361 --> 01:56:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Other than the history books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2697
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:25.020
<v Speaker 2>What do we have to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go on like what it looked</v>

2698
01:56:25.021 --> 01:56:25.530
<v Speaker 2>like to watch.</v>

2699
01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2700
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:29.160
<v Speaker 2>How do they talk to each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were these people like?</v>

2701
01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:31.050
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How people were back then?</v>

2702
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Because you've got the written word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you got coming closer to</v>

2703
01:56:33.871 --> 01:56:34.830
<v Speaker 2>the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2704
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you say moving towards more of a</v>

2705
01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.260
<v Speaker 2>truthful model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for how the world works?</v>

2706
01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so far away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it will happen quicker than</v>

2707
01:56:42.661 --> 01:56:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you think because I think with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponential expansion of technology,</v>

2708
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:49.770
<v Speaker 2>it's going to accelerate all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning and this understanding.</v>

2709
01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:52.100
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that we're,</v>

2710
01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:54.660
<v Speaker 2>we're feeling really weird about when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the Internet,</v>

2711
01:56:54.690 --> 01:56:59.280
<v Speaker 2>is this a invasion effect where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>invading our lives.</v>

2712
01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's invading people's privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's invading your time.</v>

2713
01:57:02.221 --> 01:57:05.990
<v Speaker 2>People are getting addicted to checking</v>
<v Speaker 2>websites and checking their phone.</v>

2714
01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:08.430
<v Speaker 2>It's got this sort of invasives thing.</v>

2715
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>And when I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the other day I was at um,</v>

2716
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:14.880
<v Speaker 2>this place and all these people were on</v>
<v Speaker 2>their phone and I just stopped and I was</v>

2717
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:17.970
<v Speaker 2>just looking around and all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are walking and talking on their phone</v>

2718
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:19.740
<v Speaker 2>at holding their phone in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2719
01:57:19.741 --> 01:57:22.440
<v Speaker 2>this is a takeover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a takeover.</v>

2720
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Like if that was an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it looks cute cause it's glass and</v>

2721
01:57:25.681 --> 01:57:27.270
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful and it sits in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>

2722
01:57:27.630 --> 01:57:32.630
<v Speaker 2>But if there was like an alien that came</v>
<v Speaker 2>and landed in your ear and demanded as</v>

2723
01:57:32.911 --> 01:57:36.450
<v Speaker 2>much time as your phone demands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we would think,</v>

2724
01:57:36.451 --> 01:57:37.800
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

2725
01:57:37.801 --> 01:57:40.290
<v Speaker 2>they're minds are being taken over by</v>
<v Speaker 2>this being.</v>

2726
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:45.590
<v Speaker 2>If something just climbed up on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your face and in and just start talking</v>

2727
01:57:45.661 --> 01:57:46.471
<v Speaker 2>in your ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2728
01:57:46.471 --> 01:57:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I got to my dance with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

2729
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like sitting there like with</v>

2730
01:57:49.801 --> 01:57:53.010
<v Speaker 2>these aliens on your ear all day people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would freak out.</v>

2731
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:53.850
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2732
01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get back to being people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2733
01:57:55.891 --> 01:58:00.450
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird filter between being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person and then being a person,</v>

2734
01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 2>communicating with people only through</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

2735
01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:06.030
<v Speaker 2>only through electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're inseparable,</v>

2736
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 2>inseparable from these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2737
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 2>All those things are leading us in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a weird way,</v>

2738
01:58:12.061 --> 01:58:15.510
<v Speaker 2>closer and closer and closer together to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a neural net.</v>

2739
01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2740
01:58:16.411 --> 01:58:17.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2741
01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:20.070
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of when.</v>

2742
01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:21.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2743
01:58:21.781 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 2>someday maybe no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take place.</v>

2744
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not we all choose to</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily join in,</v>

2745
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.903
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2746
01:58:29.010 --> 01:58:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be just one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable realities of the future.</v>

2747
01:58:33.630 --> 01:58:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto driving cars,</v>

2748
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 2>self driving cars are in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be like,</v>

2749
01:58:39.730 --> 01:58:40.960
<v Speaker 2>and though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2750
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:41.960
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

2751
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:44.650
<v Speaker 1>what ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always feels like human beings are</v>

2752
01:58:44.651 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 1>pushing toward what their version of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>

2753
01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody wants to live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2754
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like germ theory.</v>

2755
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Germ theory was a radical theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the germ theory remember was it's</v>

2756
01:58:56.201 --> 01:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>a very new concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2757
01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.950
<v Speaker 1>germ theory was don't drink that water</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is,</v>

2758
01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:06.940
<v Speaker 1>there are germs in there when lave and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hook and vented the microscope and was</v>

2759
01:59:06.941 --> 01:59:09.610
<v Speaker 1>checking his own saliva before he</v>
<v Speaker 1>brushed his teeth.</v>

2760
01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:11.710
<v Speaker 1>He would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd look and see there's all this,</v>

2761
01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>did germs in my mouth and they're these</v>
<v Speaker 1>little microbes that were,</v>

2762
01:59:16.271 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 1>that you can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I created these lenses and you can</v>

2763
01:59:19.751 --> 01:59:23.560
<v Speaker 1>see them and then he would clean his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth out and he'd spit into the slide</v>

2764
01:59:23.561 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 1>and he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2765
01:59:24.551 --> 01:59:27.700
<v Speaker 1>there are less of those moving things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mouth.</v>

2766
01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:30.850
<v Speaker 1>That was the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people like that with the beginning</v>

2767
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2768
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 1>of the idea that there is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called bacteria and now we're realizing</v>

2769
01:59:36.701 --> 01:59:40.300
<v Speaker 1>there are good bacteria and bad bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe your bile.</v>

2770
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:43.690
<v Speaker 1>But all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these sorts of developments were</v>

2771
01:59:43.691 --> 01:59:47.890
<v Speaker 1>there to push us beyond our biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't have to die of infection</v>

2772
01:59:47.891 --> 01:59:51.280
<v Speaker 1>anymore because we came up with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea because Alexander Fleming came up</v>

2773
01:59:51.281 --> 01:59:55.210
<v Speaker 1>with something called penicillin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a cold and he,</v>

2774
01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:58.570
<v Speaker 1>his snot dripped into a petri dish that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some mold in it.</v>

2775
01:59:58.571 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And he realized that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mold,</v>

2776
02:00:00.731 --> 02:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>it killed the bacteria that was in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>

2777
02:00:05.410 --> 02:00:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2778
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to invent something called</v>
<v Speaker 1>penicillin and antibiotics were born.</v>

2779
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:13.060
<v Speaker 1>So we had all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these giant leaps,</v>

2780
02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you can't see them but</v>
<v Speaker 1>their germs.</v>

2781
02:00:15.570 --> 02:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So wash your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2782
02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll keep things like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubonic plague may be at bay,</v>

2783
02:00:20.621 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

2784
02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And so as we move in this direction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

2785
02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>of understanding about our own biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding about our own psychology,</v>

2786
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>understanding about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2787
02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>sort of the dangers of certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies,</v>

2788
02:00:34.650 --> 02:00:35.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2789
02:00:35.391 --> 02:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>and why we should embrace other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>

2790
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everybody's of the same</v>

2791
02:00:41.351 --> 02:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>moral worth because some of these weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different because they're gay or</v>

2792
02:00:46.061 --> 02:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>there were weird clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean they should be</v>

2793
02:00:48.491 --> 02:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>ostracized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2794
02:00:49.571 --> 02:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>that means they should be included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2795
02:00:51.251 --> 02:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing here with all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge?</v>

2796
02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>What we're doing is we're saying this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better way to live.</v>

2797
02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>This is a more comfortable way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will allow us to live for a longer</v>

2798
02:01:01.001 --> 02:01:06.001
<v Speaker 1>period of time in more comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

2799
02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so we can come up with better</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

2800
02:01:12.130 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas?</v>

2801
02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>It starts to get to a point where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2802
02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing this for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it just for our entertainment?</v>

2803
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And then does that mean that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing more sensation?</v>

2804
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>It might be sensory sensation or is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea to achieve a higher level of</v>

2805
02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are problems that we</v>

2806
02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>really have trouble with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like climate change.</v>

2807
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Climate change is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got ice sheets melting at a rate.</v>

2808
02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:43.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what is the,</v>

2809
02:01:43.901 --> 02:01:48.901
<v Speaker 1>the Los Angeles basin uses one kilometer</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water a year and Greenland's ice</v>

2810
02:01:52.641 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>sheet is melting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like 240 kilometers.</v>

2811
02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>

2812
02:01:56.341 --> 02:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And we're losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2813
02:01:57.410 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>sea levels are going to rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this other huge existential</v>

2814
02:02:01.311 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>threat that's going to affect all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe push a half a billion people who</v>

2815
02:02:05.661 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>live on coastlines inland to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of,</v>

2816
02:02:09.351 --> 02:02:10.184
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2817
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecological changes on a scale maybe we</v>

2818
02:02:14.001 --> 02:02:14.834
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen.</v>

2819
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a very strange thing as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get closer to learning how to live</v>

2820
02:02:18.621 --> 02:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>together and learning a better life as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we create this neural net where we're</v>

2821
02:02:22.881 --> 02:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>getting a better understanding of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like to be somebody else,</v>

2822
02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>even though their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their software so different,</v>

2823
02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>it makes us more compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

2824
02:02:31.271 --> 02:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>as a group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2825
02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>We can have a language for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

2826
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:37.790
<v Speaker 1>at least we're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least we know that's important.</v>

2827
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>At least we know things like racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it exists,</v>

2828
02:02:40.251 --> 02:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>is kind of a bad idea for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

2829
02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting closer to this goal,</v>

2830
02:02:46.881 --> 02:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>but then I feel like there's this giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>tidal wave behind us,</v>

2831
02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.960
<v Speaker 2>ecological title women see me and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

2832
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all a moot point.</v>

2833
02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:58.940
<v Speaker 2>If we get hit by an asteroid and we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of near Earth objects that could</v>

2834
02:02:58.941 --> 02:03:00.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little in civilization</v>

2835
02:03:00.741 --> 02:03:02.990
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes back to fractals.</v>

2836
02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:03.873
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>

2837
02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.310
<v Speaker 2>there's that little bomb in Chelsea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have been obliterated.</v>

2838
02:03:07.311 --> 02:03:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I got all these plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really does go back to fractals</v>

2839
02:03:09.951 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 2>because one of the mind fuck of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mindfox is that when you go into a</v>

2840
02:03:13.881 --> 02:03:15.410
<v Speaker 2>person's body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deeper you go,</v>

2841
02:03:15.411 --> 02:03:17.120
<v Speaker 2>you hit their selves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go into their cells,</v>

2842
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:21.770
<v Speaker 2>you find subatomic particles blinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of existence,</v>

2843
02:03:21.771 --> 02:03:26.150
<v Speaker 2>and most of it is air anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot like what the fucking</v>

2844
02:03:26.151 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't,</v>

2845
02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:31.520
<v Speaker 2>we don't know because we only have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited amount of ability to measure</v>

2846
02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:33.770
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's entirely possible that inside</v>

2847
02:03:33.771 --> 02:03:37.880
<v Speaker 2>every one of those events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic events where seeing particles</v>

2848
02:03:37.881 --> 02:03:40.190
<v Speaker 2>blinking in and out of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to go deeper and</v>

2849
02:03:40.191 --> 02:03:41.960
<v Speaker 2>deeper and deeper and find a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

2850
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:44.300
<v Speaker 2>The human cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university human cells and the</v>

2851
02:03:44.301 --> 02:03:47.600
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms as so intricate and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed,</v>

2852
02:03:47.601 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>and there's so much going on that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually mind boggling.</v>

2853
02:03:50.451 --> 02:03:55.451
<v Speaker 2>You could spend a lifetime studying how</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cell breaks down and what is going on</v>

2854
02:03:57.051 --> 02:03:58.400
<v Speaker 2>in a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could spend a lifetime.</v>

2855
02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:01.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the true nature of infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why it's so impossible to</v>

2856
02:04:01.911 --> 02:04:06.470
<v Speaker 2>grasp because if there are hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of galaxies in this universe,</v>

2857
02:04:06.471 --> 02:04:11.210
<v Speaker 2>each with hundreds of billions of stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's entirely possible that all of that</v>

2858
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.900
<v Speaker 2>could just be one subatomic particle</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in another cell,</v>

2859
02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.650
<v Speaker 2>that's in some other person in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>other universe.</v>

2860
02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:21.920
<v Speaker 2>And that goes on and I mean that is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>true nature of infinity,</v>

2861
02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:25.550
<v Speaker 2>that it has no end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is entirely possible that we'll we</v>

2862
02:04:25.551 --> 02:04:28.310
<v Speaker 2>look at as a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at the inner universe like,</v>

2863
02:04:28.311 --> 02:04:29.270
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

2864
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Constantly expanding thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2865
02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:32.870
<v Speaker 2>it's so beautiful and there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell,</v>

2866
02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:37.900
<v Speaker 2>there's so many stars that it might be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a cell that's in measurable</v>

2867
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.690
<v Speaker 3>to our Little Puny La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2868
02:04:39.691 --> 02:04:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the answer then is surrender like</v>
<v Speaker 3>socrates and Newton to the argue of the</v>

2869
02:04:43.891 --> 02:04:46.860
<v Speaker 3>greatest minds that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the European tradition,</v>

2870
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:49.920
<v Speaker 3>socrates says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know more than everybody else because</v>

2871
02:04:49.921 --> 02:04:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm very aware of the fact that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically know nothing after a lifetime</v>

2872
02:04:54.031 --> 02:04:56.190
<v Speaker 3>of contemplation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Newton said,</v>

2873
02:04:56.250 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing on the shoulders of giants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he kind of liked himself to a kid</v>

2874
02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 3>skipping a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the surface of the ocean,</v>

2875
02:05:02.821 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 3>that's how much he knows newt was on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum because it seemed like Newton</v>

2876
02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:09.060
<v Speaker 3>had some really weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what he said right at the end</v>

2877
02:05:09.061 --> 02:05:10.470
<v Speaker 3>of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his greatest accomplishment.</v>

2878
02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:11.490
<v Speaker 3>You know what his greatest</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishment.</v>

2879
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:13.200
<v Speaker 3>So funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2880
02:05:13.201 --> 02:05:16.110
<v Speaker 3>my greatest accomplishment comp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he invented calculus,</v>

2881
02:05:16.230 --> 02:05:19.740
<v Speaker 3>invented calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the spatial relations theory.</v>

2882
02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Gravity motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just,</v>

2883
02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:22.860
<v Speaker 3>he's the father of all scientists.</v>

2884
02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2885
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:27.710
<v Speaker 3>he said that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my lifelong,</v>

2886
02:05:27.730 --> 02:05:29.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my biggest achievement was lifelong</v>

2887
02:05:29.731 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 3>celibacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2888
02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:32.430
<v Speaker 3>That was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2889
02:05:32.610 --> 02:05:35.280
<v Speaker 3>He was into no Posey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very religious,</v>

2890
02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.050
<v Speaker 3>very religious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But whatever that meant.</v>

2891
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.270
<v Speaker 3>But yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I think he was on the spectrum?</v>

2892
02:05:39.570 --> 02:05:42.900
<v Speaker 3>I think a mind like that on that level</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on a lot of spectrums.</v>

2893
02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:43.753
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I know?</v>

2894
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 3>But that's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2895
02:05:44.881 --> 02:05:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

2896
02:05:45.610 --> 02:05:50.010
<v Speaker 3>when we measure something or a label,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

2897
02:05:50.190 --> 02:05:51.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got asperger's,</v>

2898
02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 3>or he's autistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2899
02:05:52.441 --> 02:05:54.300
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>

2900
02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.070
<v Speaker 3>what does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2901
02:05:56.090 --> 02:05:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like being a white guy,</v>

2902
02:05:58.770 --> 02:06:00.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got blue eyes up yet,</v>

2903
02:06:00.511 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 3>but he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see his eyes.</v>

2904
02:06:01.741 --> 02:06:02.910
<v Speaker 3>They're blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the autistic.</v>

2905
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:03.321
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2906
02:06:03.321 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the big gay on his forehead.</v>

2907
02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

2908
02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:07.170
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2909
02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:08.010
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

2910
02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Just a series of characteristics and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a spectrum,</v>

2911
02:06:10.471 --> 02:06:11.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

2912
02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:13.160
<v Speaker 3>what level is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2913
02:06:13.250 --> 02:06:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Einstein that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2914
02:06:14.251 --> 02:06:17.040
<v Speaker 3>what level is Elon Musk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what level are you at,</v>

2915
02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:18.091
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2916
02:06:18.091 --> 02:06:21.450
<v Speaker 3>maybe the answer then is to get really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at one thing.</v>

2917
02:06:21.451 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 3>That's what a lot of people is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Zen sort of,</v>

2918
02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:25.830
<v Speaker 3>that's where archery's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the art of archery,</v>

2919
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2920
02:06:26.571 --> 02:06:28.650
<v Speaker 3>you learn everything through one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through deep,</v>

2921
02:06:28.651 --> 02:06:33.390
<v Speaker 3>deep practice and deep immersion into</v>
<v Speaker 3>one particular discipline.</v>

2922
02:06:33.391 --> 02:06:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Because what it requires to be expert</v>
<v Speaker 3>mastery,</v>

2923
02:06:37.710 --> 02:06:42.390
<v Speaker 3>like mastery at something will lead you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a deeper understanding of all things</v>

2924
02:06:42.450 --> 02:06:46.890
<v Speaker 3>that that would be the sort of Zen Asian</v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset,</v>

2925
02:06:46.891 --> 02:06:50.150
<v Speaker 3>which I've always loved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to be interested in a fuck load</v>

2926
02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:52.710
<v Speaker 3>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is something to be said about</v>

2927
02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Josh Waitzkin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his book and the art of learning where</v>

2928
02:06:54.991 --> 02:06:58.500
<v Speaker 3>he said when he was learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a chess master and then he got so</v>

2929
02:06:58.501 --> 02:06:59.170
<v Speaker 3>into Jujitsu.</v>

2930
02:06:59.170 --> 02:07:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Is Marcella Garcia his first black belt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

2931
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was studying Jujitsu,</v>

2932
02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I was getting better at chess when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing chess,</v>

2933
02:07:07.691 --> 02:07:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I was getting better at Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe all of its related.</v>

2934
02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it is,</v>

2935
02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:17.600
<v Speaker 3>but what my point was just so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's brains work so differently and</v>

2936
02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's all just a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mechanism as well is that in order</v>

2937
02:07:21.211 --> 02:07:25.390
<v Speaker 3>for this thing to keep moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't be a bunch of farmers can't</v>

2938
02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.460
<v Speaker 3>just be what everybody's way humans</v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with each other and the</v>

2939
02:07:29.461 --> 02:07:32.520
<v Speaker 3>innovation that comes out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the communication that comes out of</v>

2940
02:07:32.521 --> 02:07:34.800
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the change and the influence that</v>

2941
02:07:34.801 --> 02:07:37.120
<v Speaker 3>comes out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even things is innocuous.</v>

2942
02:07:37.121 --> 02:07:39.760
<v Speaker 3>As a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she two dudes that sat down,</v>

2943
02:07:39.761 --> 02:07:42.730
<v Speaker 3>one of them being a terrorist survivor</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself maybe,</v>

2944
02:07:42.731 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 3>maybe smoked a little marijuana and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>rambled for two and a half hours.</v>

2945
02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard the explosion and saw the smoke.</v>

2946
02:07:48.101 --> 02:07:48.934
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because see,</v>

2947
02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the experiences that we all have,</v>

2948
02:07:52.181 --> 02:07:54.850
<v Speaker 3>the good and the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're influential in some sort of a</v>

2949
02:07:54.851 --> 02:07:59.650
<v Speaker 3>strange way and it all seems to be kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of balancing itself out or at least</v>

2950
02:07:59.651 --> 02:08:04.450
<v Speaker 3>pushing into a certain direction and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that direction seems to be the</v>

2951
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 3>improvement of the civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the like poorly thought out</v>

2952
02:08:08.651 --> 02:08:12.280
<v Speaker 3>measures like this woman riding this</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful article about Matt Leblanc.</v>

2953
02:08:12.730 --> 02:08:16.840
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind it that she's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get support is because she's saying that</v>

2954
02:08:16.841 --> 02:08:18.940
<v Speaker 3>someone is doing something even though</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not true,</v>

2955
02:08:19.090 --> 02:08:22.360
<v Speaker 3>someone's doing something bad for</v>
<v Speaker 3>society and culture.</v>

2956
02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.500
<v Speaker 3>This person has a voice of influence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should never work again because</v>

2957
02:08:26.501 --> 02:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>society and culture demands that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>behave a certain way or we will take</v>

2958
02:08:31.061 --> 02:08:33.340
<v Speaker 3>away your livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more jokes.</v>

2959
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Well what the only way that would work</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all other than you're just a mean</v>

2960
02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 3>person and you're trying to like take</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's jobs away and make people poor.</v>

2961
02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:46.150
<v Speaker 3>The only way it would work is if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting something of merit for the</v>

2962
02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:49.300
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by saying someone is awful and</v>

2963
02:08:49.301 --> 02:08:53.680
<v Speaker 3>terrible and this is why they should</v>
<v Speaker 3>never work again like you were in some</v>

2964
02:08:53.681 --> 02:08:58.681
<v Speaker 3>sort of way in your lane minded attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to push culture forward.</v>

2965
02:08:58.811 --> 02:09:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is trying to solve a</v>

2966
02:09:01.181 --> 02:09:01.600
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a common thread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when we're looking at dealing with</v>

2968
02:09:05.021 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 3>international crisis's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we're looking at those</v>

2969
02:09:08.231 --> 02:09:10.510
<v Speaker 3>crises is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is we don't want them to blow up in our</v>

2970
02:09:10.511 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to push towards a better future</v>

2971
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:16.120
<v Speaker 3>is dangerous though because this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2972
02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:20.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>principles and understanding and</v>

2973
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:22.420
<v Speaker 3>understanding what the goal is.</v>

2974
02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Philosophy is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll give you an example.</v>

2975
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be very careful of giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>people a pass and not saying you are,</v>

2976
02:09:28.691 --> 02:09:31.750
<v Speaker 3>but of giving people a pass in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>notion that they're trying to solve a</v>

2977
02:09:31.751 --> 02:09:34.330
<v Speaker 3>problem because the means don't justify</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ends.</v>

2978
02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:37.080
<v Speaker 3>You have plenty of examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2979
02:09:37.110 --> 02:09:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I had an acting teacher one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2980
02:09:38.621 --> 02:09:41.230
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to play Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to play Stalin as an</v>

2981
02:09:41.231 --> 02:09:42.820
<v Speaker 3>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't play him as a monster.</v>

2982
02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:44.500
<v Speaker 3>You've got to play him as a guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to solve a problem.</v>

2983
02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:46.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Hitler's mind,</v>

2984
02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 3>in his twisted mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to solve a problem.</v>

2985
02:09:49.511 --> 02:09:51.940
<v Speaker 3>That problem was Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gypsies,</v>

2986
02:09:51.970 --> 02:09:55.420
<v Speaker 3>gays or anybody who wasn't quote Unquote</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arion.</v>

2987
02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:57.520
<v Speaker 3>And he was going to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>

2988
02:09:57.521 --> 02:09:59.200
<v Speaker 3>he's going to make the world a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2989
02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:03.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where the real work comes</v>

2990
02:10:03.821 --> 02:10:05.530
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I think it's so important</v>

2991
02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:09.550
<v Speaker 3>to be able to articulate for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for others why,</v>

2992
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:15.150
<v Speaker 3>why certain things are better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain ways of living,</v>

2993
02:10:15.881 --> 02:10:18.760
<v Speaker 3>certain beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain practices.</v>

2994
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:19.540
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pr,</v>

2995
02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:22.990
<v Speaker 3>cultural practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain philosophies politically for</v>

2996
02:10:22.991 --> 02:10:25.180
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are better for the greater good.</v>

2997
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Then is this over here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where people like Michael</v>

2998
02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Shermer and Sam Harris are doing great</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2999
02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:34.550
<v Speaker 3>That's where those guys sit around and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they articulate</v>

3000
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:39.530
<v Speaker 1>for us things that we might intuitively</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel or they sway us in a better</v>

3001
02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:44.270
<v Speaker 1>direction when our emotion takes us in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different direction.</v>

3002
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>When our emotion says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's vote for trump because he's a guy</v>

3003
02:10:48.831 --> 02:10:52.630
<v Speaker 1>who at least is quote unquote getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit done or he's taken the chess and</v>

3004
02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>the toilet in the air and then the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober thinkers who spend time thinking</v>

3005
02:10:57.531 --> 02:10:58.700
<v Speaker 1>about this say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey bri,</v>

3006
02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey steve over there.</v>

3007
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you feel this way.</v>

3008
02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me steer you over here and here's</v>

3009
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we should be actually,</v>

3010
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about trying to solve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

3011
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:09.830
<v Speaker 1>but let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

3012
02:11:09.831 --> 02:11:12.110
<v Speaker 1>let's get to what we're really trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to and here's what,</v>

3013
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:16.280
<v Speaker 2>there's also a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like we talked about before,</v>

3014
02:11:16.281 --> 02:11:20.930
<v Speaker 2>people love to be on a team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love to associate with a group.</v>

3015
02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:23.210
<v Speaker 2>We all do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why they were in that ugly</v>

3016
02:11:23.211 --> 02:11:25.490
<v Speaker 2>hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That red hat with the white letters,</v>

3017
02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.260
<v Speaker 2>keep ms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make America great again,</v>

3018
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:28.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

3019
02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:30.170
<v Speaker 2>that's a fuck you to everyone is</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking,</v>

3020
02:11:30.171 --> 02:11:32.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a bread feather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on your,</v>

3021
02:11:32.661 --> 02:11:35.380
<v Speaker 2>a bright red peacock feather that's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head and you're,</v>

3022
02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:38.330
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also like other assholes,</v>

3023
02:11:38.331 --> 02:11:40.850
<v Speaker 2>fellow assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them and they honk at you and</v>

3024
02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:44.240
<v Speaker 2>they'll like make America great gun Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll pump their fist up.</v>

3025
02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a part of what's going on here.</v>

3026
02:11:46.221 --> 02:11:48.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a bunch of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3027
02:11:48.471 --> 02:11:49.820
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this system is fucked.</v>

3028
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 2>The only way it's going to be fixed is</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it just,</v>

3029
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:53.300
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing gets thrown into</v>
<v Speaker 2>turmoil.</v>

3030
02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.550
<v Speaker 2>He's our best bet for that and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree.</v>

3031
02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:57.620
<v Speaker 2>He's our best bet for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just is,</v>

3032
02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:01.160
<v Speaker 2>is as far as like upsetting the tray and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going,</v>

3033
02:12:01.161 --> 02:12:02.450
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens now.</v>

3034
02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3035
02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>let's fix some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

3036
02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:06.290
<v Speaker 2>How'd that guy get through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3037
02:12:06.291 --> 02:12:09.740
<v Speaker 2>like he's our best bet for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

3038
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:12.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous.</v>

3039
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:16.700
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous to to also cater to that</v>

3040
02:12:16.701 --> 02:12:18.530
<v Speaker 2>lowest common denominator</v>

3041
02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>earned in revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions an even no matter how small,</v>

3042
02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you're going to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's sort of settled,</v>

3043
02:12:24.810 --> 02:12:28.670
<v Speaker 1>it was there for a reason that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>became theirs.</v>

3044
02:12:28.690 --> 02:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>There is an organic set point sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to societies and when you come in and</v>

3045
02:12:33.491 --> 02:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>somebody just throws everything out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bath water,</v>

3046
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it does historically have a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it typically doesn't have a good day.</v>

3047
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean maybe you can maybe can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

3048
02:12:42.221 --> 02:12:43.970
<v Speaker 2>it's possible they could engineer</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>

3049
02:12:43.971 --> 02:12:44.331
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3050
02:12:44.331 --> 02:12:48.560
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is he doesn't like as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spokesperson,</v>

3051
02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:51.450
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't represent progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3052
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Like Obama represented substantial</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress over Bush as far as speaking as</v>

3053
02:12:57.741 --> 02:13:00.350
<v Speaker 2>far as his intelligence level has</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulation level.</v>

3054
02:13:00.351 --> 02:13:03.380
<v Speaker 2>His likeability is in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would even argue his also,</v>

3055
02:13:03.381 --> 02:13:06.980
<v Speaker 2>his prudence is an inaction is he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>very careful.</v>

3056
02:13:06.981 --> 02:13:09.680
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what we'll define Obama's</v>

3057
02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:12.920
<v Speaker 2>presidency I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably in a favorable light,</v>

3058
02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:16.850
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that he was not willing to</v>

3059
02:13:16.851 --> 02:13:20.870
<v Speaker 2>take action very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just as important sometimes as</v>

3060
02:13:20.871 --> 02:13:24.890
<v Speaker 2>taking action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's possible he could free</v>

3061
02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Edward Snowden?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The could exonerate him before he leaves</v>

3062
02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 2>office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take heat for this,</v>

3063
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but personally I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3064
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 3>hope he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pardon him.</v>

3065
02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:36.540
<v Speaker 3>You got to take heat from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3066
02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:36.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3067
02:13:36.961 --> 02:13:39.360
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people consider him a trader</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

3068
02:13:39.361 --> 02:13:39.931
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3069
02:13:39.931 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 3>you hear a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think Edward Snowden did us a</v>

3070
02:13:43.111 --> 02:13:45.240
<v Speaker 3>great service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a very gutsy guy.</v>

3071
02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:47.670
<v Speaker 3>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an American of a patriot.</v>

3072
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was alerting us of a crime that</v>

3073
02:13:50.071 --> 02:13:52.980
<v Speaker 3>people that we elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're engaging in and a lot of people</v>

3074
02:13:52.981 --> 02:13:56.550
<v Speaker 3>that we didn't elect a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're doing something that's</v>

3075
02:13:56.551 --> 02:13:59.670
<v Speaker 3>unconstitutional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not approved and that the</v>

3076
02:13:59.850 --> 02:14:02.490
<v Speaker 3>citizens of the United States do not</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

3077
02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>But that's a good example of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3078
02:14:04.231 --> 02:14:07.650
<v Speaker 3>That's a good example of people that get</v>
<v Speaker 3>very emotional at the idea that this guy</v>

3079
02:14:07.651 --> 02:14:11.640
<v Speaker 3>betrayed our intelligence agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our military and things like that.</v>

3080
02:14:11.641 --> 02:14:12.600
<v Speaker 3>So that's what they're saying.</v>

3081
02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:14.370
<v Speaker 3>So that becomes team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3082
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it in this perspective.</v>

3083
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:18.600
<v Speaker 3>They caught that fucking guy in New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

3084
02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:21.150
<v Speaker 3>the book the bomber within a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

3085
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Would they have been able to do that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did not have extensive surveillance</v>

3086
02:14:27.061 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 3>methods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

3087
02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:34.070
<v Speaker 3>And is that worth the influence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>these these surveillance methods have on</v>

3088
02:14:35.731 --> 02:14:38.910
<v Speaker 3>us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you know that your phone's being</v>

3089
02:14:38.911 --> 02:14:42.810
<v Speaker 3>watched and that all those Dick pictures</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you send are all being collected</v>

3090
02:14:42.811 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and then all those crazy texts</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sent about the government</v>

3091
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:49.710
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies are all being collected</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and potentially could be used</v>

3092
02:14:49.711 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 3>against you if you run for office</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

3093
02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:53.430
<v Speaker 3>So if you decide to run for office and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3094
02:14:53.431 --> 02:14:55.680
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I love New York City is time.</v>

3095
02:14:55.681 --> 02:14:58.160
<v Speaker 3>New York City had a mayor that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people understand I'm going to run for</v>

3096
02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:58.600
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3097
02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm just an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to.</v>

3098
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:02.010
<v Speaker 3>And then all of sudden they pull you</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a room and say,</v>

3099
02:15:02.011 --> 02:15:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Hey Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come over here.</v>

3100
02:15:04.021 --> 02:15:05.730
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd like to talk to you about some of</v>

3101
02:15:05.731 --> 02:15:07.230
<v Speaker 3>the emails that you've sent over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3102
02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:08.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll answer that question with two with</v>

3103
02:15:08.761 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 3>two parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this one,</v>

3104
02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.180
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a new radio lab that's talking</v>

3105
02:15:12.181 --> 02:15:13.100
<v Speaker 3>about surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3106
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy stories in it.</v>

3107
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:17.490
<v Speaker 3>And they've done good stuff in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott lab where they caught where they</v>

3108
02:15:17.491 --> 02:15:20.280
<v Speaker 3>caught the cartel members and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll answer that two ways.</v>

3109
02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:25.800
<v Speaker 3>One is if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if surveillance is a reality and law</v>

3110
02:15:25.801 --> 02:15:27.480
<v Speaker 3>enforcement has to have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>surveillance,</v>

3111
02:15:27.481 --> 02:15:29.520
<v Speaker 3>they do great work and they keep us</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

3112
02:15:29.550 --> 02:15:31.980
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are their history would suggest</v>

3113
02:15:31.981 --> 02:15:35.220
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that uh,</v>

3114
02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:39.720
<v Speaker 3>surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you give the government power over</v>

3115
02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:44.721
<v Speaker 3>you in that context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only going to grow unless you have</v>

3116
02:15:44.821 --> 02:15:48.330
<v Speaker 3>very strong checks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>balances and transparency.</v>

3117
02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:53.540
<v Speaker 3>It is only going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that has been the track record of</v>

3118
02:15:53.851 --> 02:15:57.300
<v Speaker 3>every government and that's just how</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are.</v>

3119
02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.370
<v Speaker 3>They are going to take the power they</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel is necessary and more so if you</v>

3120
02:16:02.371 --> 02:16:05.940
<v Speaker 3>give it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was eisenhower leaving office that</v>

3121
02:16:05.941 --> 02:16:09.090
<v Speaker 3>the military industrial complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that crazy speech that he gave,</v>

3122
02:16:09.091 --> 02:16:11.410
<v Speaker 3>which was just like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was precious.</v>

3123
02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:13.860
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so amazing because it was only</v>

3124
02:16:13.861 --> 02:16:18.861
<v Speaker 3>seen on television that one time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it took until it was made into vhs</v>

3125
02:16:19.411 --> 02:16:23.700
<v Speaker 3>or DVD or whatever and then leaked</v>
<v Speaker 3>online where people got a glimpse.</v>

3126
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:27.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean most people are not going over</v>
<v Speaker 3>former presidential speeches with a fine</v>

3127
02:16:27.571 --> 02:16:29.470
<v Speaker 3>tooth comb trying to find nuggets of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom.</v>

3128
02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 3>But that one now has made its way into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cultural zeitgeist.</v>

3129
02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outcome.</v>

3130
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 3>This really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3131
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.330
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a call,</v>

3132
02:16:37.331 --> 02:16:38.500
<v Speaker 3>it was called to the people.</v>

3133
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 3>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be careful because there's a machine out</v>

3134
02:16:41.111 --> 02:16:42.610
<v Speaker 3>there that wants to go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3135
02:16:42.611 --> 02:16:47.440
<v Speaker 3>be careful of this to the second part to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that surveillance and uh,</v>

3136
02:16:47.441 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3137
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:52.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be checked and Edward Snowden</v>

3138
02:16:52.391 --> 02:16:53.650
<v Speaker 3>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a trader.</v>

3139
02:16:53.651 --> 02:16:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the fact is is that if the</v>

3140
02:16:57.701 --> 02:17:02.260
<v Speaker 3>government now has control over what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>say and if the government is listening</v>

3141
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:07.261
<v Speaker 3>in without my consent and I'm a private</v>
<v Speaker 3>citizen who doesn't commit crimes,</v>

3142
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:12.100
<v Speaker 3>then I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the terrorists have won.</v>

3143
02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:16.450
<v Speaker 3>They won because they changed the way I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think and they changed the way my</v>

3144
02:17:16.451 --> 02:17:21.451
<v Speaker 3>governor governs me and they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>created anonymity and a power structure</v>

3145
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that can do whatever the fuck they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to its citizenry.</v>

3146
02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:30.130
<v Speaker 3>That is UNAMERICAN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is anti-constitutional.</v>

3147
02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:33.160
<v Speaker 3>That is not the country I want to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

3148
02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not most importantly what makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country great.</v>

3149
02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:40.060
<v Speaker 3>It is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what Russia does and a lot of</v>

3150
02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:42.490
<v Speaker 3>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you want a weaker country,</v>

3151
02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:47.350
<v Speaker 3>ironically it is not to give government</v>
<v Speaker 3>agencies,</v>

3152
02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't care who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how well intentioned they</v>

3153
02:17:51.341 --> 02:17:52.900
<v Speaker 3>are and a lot of them are well</v>
<v Speaker 3>intentioned,</v>

3154
02:17:52.901 --> 02:17:54.820
<v Speaker 3>they do great work and they keep us</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

3155
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:58.780
<v Speaker 3>You better have transparency and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have better have checks and balances and</v>

3156
02:17:58.781 --> 02:18:02.050
<v Speaker 3>you better be following the law and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>better have court orders,</v>

3157
02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:03.280
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

3158
02:18:03.281 --> 02:18:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I want all those systems in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

3159
02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what,</v>

3160
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:10.600
<v Speaker 3>it might be cumbersome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be a pain in the ass.</v>

3161
02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:13.150
<v Speaker 3>It might even make us a little less safe</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

3162
02:18:13.390 --> 02:18:16.210
<v Speaker 3>but I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking take that over.</v>

3163
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Giving any government agency power over</v>
<v Speaker 3>my private affairs and letting them</v>

3164
02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:23.710
<v Speaker 3>listen in specifically.</v>

3165
02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:25.270
<v Speaker 3>And then ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>

3166
02:18:25.271 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 3>a big part of the problem is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all just people like you,</v>

3167
02:18:28.181 --> 02:18:29.620
<v Speaker 3>really curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just people.</v>

3168
02:18:29.650 --> 02:18:34.390
<v Speaker 3>You can really can't have people having</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of control and power over</v>

3169
02:18:34.391 --> 02:18:36.280
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just as we talked about at the beginning</v>

3170
02:18:36.281 --> 02:18:38.650
<v Speaker 3>of the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that starts out about Greenpeace and</v>

3171
02:18:38.651 --> 02:18:40.660
<v Speaker 3>then after a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes about having power.</v>

3172
02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people love to have a position of</v>

3173
02:18:44.681 --> 02:18:46.870
<v Speaker 3>influence and power and they don't give</v>
<v Speaker 3>it up.</v>

3174
02:18:46.871 --> 02:18:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3175
02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:49.240
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that is your life,</v>

3176
02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what you do.</v>

3177
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a police officer and I'm the law in</v>

3178
02:18:53.771 --> 02:18:54.850
<v Speaker 3>this town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3179
02:18:54.851 --> 02:18:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we love those movies.</v>

3180
02:18:56.350 --> 02:18:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>

3181
02:18:57.250 --> 02:18:59.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of craziness is,</v>

3182
02:18:59.401 --> 02:19:01.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's human toxic hating.</v>

3183
02:19:01.061 --> 02:19:02.440
<v Speaker 3>People always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh the cops and said like,</v>

3184
02:19:02.441 --> 02:19:03.460
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of great,</v>

3185
02:19:03.461 --> 02:19:04.860
<v Speaker 3>like we said.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you start with the federalist papers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>read the Constitution and the bill of</v>

3192
02:19:16.961 --> 02:19:18.850
<v Speaker 3>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the solution.</v>

3197
02:19:27.630 --> 02:19:28.010

<v Speaker 2>founding fathers that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the solution.</v>

3199
02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Challenges.</v>

3200
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is complicated men.</v>

3201
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do need surveillance.</v>

3202
02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology is making it so that they can</v>

3203
02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:43.250
<v Speaker 2>listen in on all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also making them transparent.</v>

3204
02:19:43.251 --> 02:19:47.510
<v Speaker 2>They're getting dusted left and right as</v>
<v Speaker 2>people from our generation are slowly</v>

3205
02:19:47.511 --> 02:19:49.810
<v Speaker 2>starting to get into office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

3206
02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:53.300
<v Speaker 2>there's more of that to people who grew</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and have the internet when they were</v>

3207
02:19:53.301 --> 02:19:57.320
<v Speaker 2>younger and it helped form their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their understanding of the world in a</v>

3208
02:19:57.321 --> 02:20:01.190
<v Speaker 2>better way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also explained to them the nature</v>

3209
02:20:01.191 --> 02:20:03.260
<v Speaker 2>of transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're seeing this guy who was a</v>

3210
02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:07.250
<v Speaker 2>hillary Clinton's email deleter they</v>
<v Speaker 2>found his account on reddit and he was</v>

3211
02:20:07.251 --> 02:20:10.010
<v Speaker 2>asking a couple of years ago how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>delete emails,</v>

3212
02:20:10.011 --> 02:20:11.000
<v Speaker 2>chains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass.</v>

3213
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's total smoking gun.</v>

3214
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found it and then he deleted the</v>

3215
02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:20.960
<v Speaker 2>reddit post after they found it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had had a certain reddit handle and</v>

3216
02:20:21.081 --> 02:20:23.210
<v Speaker 2>they could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could bring that reddit handle,</v>

3217
02:20:23.211 --> 02:20:24.410
<v Speaker 2>they could connect it back to him.</v>

3218
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That a lot of that I suspect is,</v>

3219
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:30.020
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is hillary not wanting people to see</v>

3220
02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:31.970
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was talking about how this was an</v>

3221
02:20:31.971 --> 02:20:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Islamic fundamentalist movement that</v>
<v Speaker 2>began Bengazi stuff.</v>

3222
02:20:35.241 --> 02:20:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3223
02:20:36.501 --> 02:20:39.200
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Obama administration has this</v>

3224
02:20:39.201 --> 02:20:42.890
<v Speaker 2>strange edict and where they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really mention that it's Islamic</v>

3225
02:20:42.891 --> 02:20:45.770
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mentioned that it's extremism.</v>

3226
02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about Orlando?</v>

3227
02:20:46.850 --> 02:20:49.160
<v Speaker 2>They literally cut it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcripts.</v>

3228
02:20:49.161 --> 02:20:52.940
<v Speaker 2>The things that the shooter was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd cut mentions to Islam and</v>

3229
02:20:53.970 --> 02:20:56.370
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] were living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we live in where,</v>

3230
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:57.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lying.</v>

3231
02:20:57.930 --> 02:20:59.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not helping anybody not helping</v>
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>

3232
02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:03.680
<v Speaker 2>The fact of the matter is these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are Islamic fundamentalists and you're</v>

3233
02:21:03.681 --> 02:21:06.950
<v Speaker 2>just gonna make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't acknowledge that fact,</v>

3234
02:21:06.951 --> 02:21:08.690
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to deny people</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

3235
02:21:08.691 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 2>They're going to think there's some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conspiracy.</v>

3236
02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:11.360
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get angry.</v>

3237
02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:13.250
<v Speaker 2>They're going to feel like they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being represented properly.</v>

3238
02:21:13.251 --> 02:21:16.340
<v Speaker 2>They're going to think these liberal</v>
<v Speaker 2>pussies are fucking ruining our great</v>

3239
02:21:16.341 --> 02:21:18.560
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to build up Donald Trump.</v>

3240
02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:20.500
<v Speaker 2>That's where a guy like Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from.</v>

3241
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:24.500
<v Speaker 2>The over the over sensitivity of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left is what's created Donald Trump.</v>

3242
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:27.680
<v Speaker 2>The acceptance of Caitlyn Jenner created</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

3243
02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 2>This is Caitlyn Jenner is the prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got to go back to Caitlyn Jenner,</v>

3244
02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:34.460
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go back to Bruce Jenner first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3245
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:36.890
<v Speaker 2>And that goes just tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny little nose.</v>

3246
02:21:36.891 --> 02:21:37.251
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3247
02:21:37.251 --> 02:21:38.360
<v Speaker 2>how about the jaw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3248
02:21:38.361 --> 02:21:40.610
<v Speaker 2>jaw shave down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a good looking man and is</v>

3249
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:41.810
<v Speaker 2>facing a rubber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3250
02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 2>its face doesn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't talk.</v>

3251
02:21:43.491 --> 02:21:44.181
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3252
02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:48.200
<v Speaker 2>And we're supposed to ignore the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he irresponsibly plowed into a</v>

3253
02:21:48.201 --> 02:21:51.020
<v Speaker 2>woman and pushed her into fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic and killed her.</v>

3254
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Was he on his phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not paying attention.</v>

3255
02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:57.080
<v Speaker 2>He rear ended with a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant escalate that was pulling a</v>

3256
02:21:57.081 --> 02:21:58.970
<v Speaker 2>boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had all this weight,</v>

3257
02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:01.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slams in this woman's car,</v>

3258
02:22:01.191 --> 02:22:05.390
<v Speaker 2>pushes her into traffic and she gets hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>by an oncoming car and you know,</v>

3259
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:06.860
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3260
02:22:06.930 --> 02:22:09.500
<v Speaker 2>diversity is what's important here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a woman's life.</v>

3261
02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:11.800
<v Speaker 2>What's important here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The My,</v>

3262
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.280
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

3263
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:16.250
<v Speaker 2>it just drops it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody drops an exonerates him.</v>

3264
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:18.680
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying she should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>punished forever being careless,</v>

3265
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:22.340
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that's a significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicator of someone having a fucked up</v>

3266
02:22:22.341 --> 02:22:25.440
<v Speaker 2>personality that all you want to do and</v>

<v Speaker 3>changing moment all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
