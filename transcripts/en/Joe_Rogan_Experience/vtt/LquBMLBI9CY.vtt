<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

26

00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:27.904
<v Speaker 1>had an edible last night I did this a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a show that my friend Jeremiah </v>

35
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.063
<v Speaker 1>Watkins House and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a make 'em up show or they call it </v>

36
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>stand up on the spot where the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>would yell out,</v>

37
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>

39
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.440

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>what your thoughts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get some comedy out of it.</v>

41
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally maybe one out of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects,</v>

42
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>it will actually yield a real bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll come become a bit in your act.</v>

43
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of amazing because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put on the pressure like that,</v>

44
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a good time to test the deep end of</v>

<v Speaker 1>the pool and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what these a speed we'd edibles</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm cool now.</v>

74

<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>

82
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to get stuck in my head.</v>

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.394
<v Speaker 1>certified cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in bed at night and that should </v>

85
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>all be in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just over and over and over and over and</v>

86
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:54.394
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have wizards would come up with </v>

87
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.134
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

88
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Even the ones that suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just get in there,</v>

89
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.961
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

90
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he gets out.</v>

91
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 1>They gave him some fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Adavan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you can give them next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give him some coffee.</v>

94
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Coffee is like one of the best things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

95
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about caffeine </v>

96
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>apparently that counteracts the effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of marijuana when you're a really high,</v>

97
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>they said just drink some coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to do that next time.</v>

98
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens.</v>

99
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

100
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At an a hot shower.</v>

101
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.893
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got their own fucking home </v>

102
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>remedy for this shit I guess.</v>

103
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've done it a few times,</v>

104
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what the panic attack is,</v>

105
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.304
<v Speaker 1>is essentially your brain taking an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audit of all the things that are real </v>

106
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>and a real worries that you haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering at home.</v>

107
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And then they fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you prepared?</v>

109
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what if it's tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>

110
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Have you had a good life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

111
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.193
<v Speaker 1>what if someone close to you dies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you're gonna be able to </v>

112
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

113
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you just start thinking like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

114
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>And it just makes you aware of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

115
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>And then once it wears off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you reach that sort of a neutral point </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

117
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Well he's a hypochondriac to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not good.</v>

118
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep guys like that weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should know better.</v>

119
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Well he's fine if he smokes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he eats it it's different things,</v>

120
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different shit.</v>

121
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>

122
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

123
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Was the big podcast that kind of Sunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo.</v>

124
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a combination of Mama need </v>
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>

125
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>And I remember it was years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was me watching him on your show that</v>

126
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:28.834
<v Speaker 1>led us to ask about that cause I saw him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your show and he was like God at the </v>

127
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:33.874
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I remember at the time he was on </v>

128
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>our show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I told Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my cohosts like Paul,</v>

130
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>this guy ain't no lightweight and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a huge army of sycophants right now.</v>

131
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>If you get into debate with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lose,</v>

132
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you're a total bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you tie,</v>

133
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you win by a little,</v>

134
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.573
<v Speaker 1>you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way you can actually beat him </v>

135
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>with his army of sycophants at this time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if you just demolish him.</v>

136
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>So don't even try.</v>

137
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.263
<v Speaker 1>You were concerned about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is like something you planned </v>

138
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>out in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

139
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really a plan.</v>

140
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to bring it up cause I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>him on your show sane and I'm like,</v>

141
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>that's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of knew where he was coming from.</v>

142
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.373
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I knew that he had had </v>

143
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:17.384
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sexual experiences when he was </v>

144
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>younger and he was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was trying to trivialize them</v>

145
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and turn them into humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean his way of dealing with it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

148
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>say I owe me and it was mutual between </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and the priest.</v>

150
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I was molested by a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in new it,</v>

151
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>so it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

152
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I was the predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he said,</v>

154
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Deuce the priest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

155
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

156
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard for me to imagine a 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old boy,</v>

157
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>no matter how flamboyantly gay or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually aggressive,</v>

158
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>jumping the priest bones or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

160
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

161
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.283
<v Speaker 1>it sort of gives you a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how this guy came to </v>

162
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who he is today and why he's so relishes</v>

163
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>this role of being the contrarian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being this,</v>

164
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:09.404
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of very difficult to </v>

165
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:16.361
<v Speaker 1>pigeonhole gay man who's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative but yet believes in man.</v>

166
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Boy Love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

167
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.233
<v Speaker 1>if you go back and you read old articles</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he wrote for publications that he </v>

168
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>worked for in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of stuff like we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take on bullying on twitter and</v>

170
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to make a safe space for people.</v>

171
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

172
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.280
<v Speaker 1>This is Milo and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

173
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>he's like the biggest troll.</v>

174
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

175
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean we talked about my low last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

176
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I was on your show and you told me you </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of put the seed in my brain,</v>

177
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] kind of like fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more I've looked into it,</v>

178
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.774
<v Speaker 1>the more I have to question whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that shit with the priest even </v>

179
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>happened to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

181
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.503
<v Speaker 1>I don't really trust the shit that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of his mouth in terms of like face </v>

182
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

183
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of times when Milo </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to make a point,</v>

184
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't necessarily make it by </v>

185
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:13.590
<v Speaker 1>directly saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to make it through uh,</v>

186
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>like performance art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he went on Bill Maher and,</v>

187
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

188
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.883
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing this whole flamboyant gay </v>

189
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.294
<v Speaker 1>conservative thing because he wants the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Liberal Bill Maher audience to be </v>

190
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

191
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look what hypocrites.</v>

192
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>They say they accept gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second you don't tow their line,</v>

193
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>what they obviously like is people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>told their line,</v>

194
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>not gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

195
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the point he was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make.</v>

196
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Bill Maher the next day after,</v>

197
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo scandal broke was like I took him </v>

198
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me.</v>

199
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It was his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took them down.</v>

201
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:51.591
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

202
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:52.424
<v Speaker 1>you compare it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said he was the next hitchens when </v>

203
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 1>he was on your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

204
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 1>He really said he tells him down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

205
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I took him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

206
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 2>choke him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

207
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 2>he's a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a foolish thing to think.</v>

208
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.181
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

209
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 2>you know what I think is what Milo does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is performance art.</v>

210
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of trolling and it's a lot of</v>

211
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:11.034
<v Speaker 2>very calculated stuff designed to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rile people up and get people active </v>

212
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:16.284
<v Speaker 2>and get people to talk about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the reason why he does </v>

213
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:21.010
<v Speaker 2>this tour on colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

214
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.883
<v Speaker 2>why wilds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not do it in the lion's den if you </v>

215
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 2>want to get the roars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's doing it like where he feels</v>

216
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>like this problem is the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

217
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.264
<v Speaker 2>he wants to stir that pot too because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows if he just does it in some club </v>

218
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.910
<v Speaker 2>downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

219
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.803
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not going to be any protest and </v>

220
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:36.144
<v Speaker 2>was going to give a shit.</v>

221
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 2>It's still protest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

222
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:38.364
<v Speaker 2>But not like bringing it to their camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't be like what happened at </v>

223
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

224
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened at Berkeley?</v>

225
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 2>It was just fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really insane.</v>

226
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:45.474
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it the mayor of San Francisco that </v>

227
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 2>was applauding the protests like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People throwing chairs through starbucks</v>

230
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:55.060
<v Speaker 2>windows and light and cop cars on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this,</v>

231
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.023
<v Speaker 2>this ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been articles on like the </v>

232
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Huffington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost made a video about this article</v>

233
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 2>on the Huffington post actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was basically like,</v>

234
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence is as valid a reaction to trump</v>

235
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 2>as anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

236
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.303
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally just advocating for </v>

237
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

238
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>and you think you're so enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 2>It's completely foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

240
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 2>it goes in once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things aren't going their way.</v>

241
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 2>It goes against everything they've stood</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

242
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about kindness?</v>

243
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 2>What about compassion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about treating people with love?</v>

244
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 2>What about facts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

245
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they're in power.</v>

246
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay when they're in power,</v>

247
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 2>but when someone else's in that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like it all kind of goes out.</v>

248
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:36.730
<v Speaker 2>They'll kind of goes both ways though </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

249
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely does mean,</v>

250
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 2>remember when Obama was in office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was people that were calling him a</v>

251
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Muslim and they were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking them out.</v>

252
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I ain't fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

253
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard rednecks.</v>

254
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 2>I was living in Louisiana at the time he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was elected and I heard redneck say shit</v>

255
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:49.201
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

256
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait for someone who was Sasha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate,</v>

257
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 2>this piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were looking forward to it.</v>

259
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Like not only did they think it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable he'd be assassinated,</v>

260
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

261
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:00.660
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a good thing.</v>

262
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.690
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a good day for </v>
<v Speaker 2>America when Obama was finally killed.</v>

263
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.530
<v Speaker 2>And when they say things like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you corner them,</v>

264
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:05.941
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

265
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:07.740
<v Speaker 2>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's so bad about them?</v>

266
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 2>What Bob would drives you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nuts.</v>

267
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 2>He's a Kenyan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a Muslim and he says Shosha list.</v>

268
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Socialists,</v>

269
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>socialist months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim Kenyon,</v>

270
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>communist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a secret Muslim.</v>

271
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if someone pulled off </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism somewhere.</v>

272
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was one country can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

273
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys are happy.</v>

274
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean those folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at socialism as like a </v>

275
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.054
<v Speaker 2>gradient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's plenty of countries that </v>

276
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:32.214
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have like more or less they're </v>

277
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.194
<v Speaker 2>socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pure socialism is a good idea anymore </v>

278
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 2>than like pure capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

279
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just need laissez faire.</v>

280
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the the the libertarian idea.</v>

281
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.143
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the markets will take care of </v>

282
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:47.304
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many libertarians is it take to </v>

283
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>screw in a light bulb?</v>

284
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The free market will take care of it.</v>

285
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well those people get a little goofy and</v>

286
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:55.324
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the most frustrating to me is the </v>

287
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>anarchists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones who walk on,</v>

288
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>no taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

289
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.530
<v Speaker 2>no cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

290
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Nobody fixes the roads and private </v>
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>

291
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.270
<v Speaker 2>All those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even wars.</v>

292
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like private police.</v>

293
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean everyone,</v>

294
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have money,</v>

295
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:10.924
<v Speaker 2>you just hire out your own justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean higher up thugs d does that </v>

296
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>really seem like they would be objective</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in pursuit of like a justice?</v>

297
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:20.794
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they would just be your </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed thugs that are going to meet out </v>

298
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever form of justice you think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>

299
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well for sure.</v>

300
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 2>If they're working for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be an issue.</v>

301
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 2>If you're the big boss and the big boss </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants these laws and forest,</v>

302
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the big boss passes zone laws </v>

303
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 2>on his property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes things different.</v>

304
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like it gets real weird when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with 350 million people.</v>

305
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 2>That's really a part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what,</v>

306
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.123
<v Speaker 2>what the style of civilization that </v>
<v Speaker 2>works well for one person is not what's </v>

307
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:52.290
<v Speaker 2>preferred by another person and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things combined with the,</v>

308
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:53.124
<v Speaker 2>the whole an antiquated voting system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole ridiculous electoral college </v>

309
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just said,</v>

310
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to achieve some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of peace of mind.</v>

311
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Super Delegates and Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the most ridiculous.</v>

312
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:05.471
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

313
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Hold on you a super delicate so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that work?</v>

314
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>You can decide not to vote for the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire state voted.</v>

315
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

316
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.153
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And leaving it up to them to make sure </v>

317
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that trump doesn't get a stop gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

318
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:19.534
<v Speaker 2>like because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in power have always been </v>

319
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 2>afraid of the actual will of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anything they can do,</v>

320
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 2>they want to safeguard like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if the people choose poorly,</v>

321
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to be able to stop that from </v>

322
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

323
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to those uninformed fools.</v>

324
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 2>We can't leave them up to their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

325
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>In all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been around America and there are a</v>

326
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 2>lot of uninformed fools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few,</v>

327
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.373
<v Speaker 2>quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think you think it's like </v>

328
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:42.634
<v Speaker 2>half of us are uninformed fools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even want to throw out a </v>

329
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:46.744
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just a lot of people that </v>

330
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:49.474
<v Speaker 2>are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hard to know because you </v>

331
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:51.544
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really almost don't know what </v>

332
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 2>someone really thinks until you sit down</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them one by one,</v>

333
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one on one and have a conversation.</v>

334
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you don't keep a real job.</v>

335
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:00.874
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you had a real </v>

336
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A job job.</v>

337
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I worked at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hop for two days.</v>

338
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.820

339
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:10.654
<v Speaker 2>More than 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what have you been doing for the </v>

340
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 2>most part since then?</v>

341
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 2>See if you can make it live and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

343
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>In this day and age you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

344
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:21.730

<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

345
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 2>if your mood from the employer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>employee grid,</v>

346
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you get to see things in a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

347
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is all temporary and you know,</v>

348
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 2>everyone's working towards some future </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really never comes.</v>

349
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.073
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the life that you're </v>

350
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 2>experiencing right now is life.</v>

00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:40.524
<v Speaker 1>still to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's interesting because you do </v>

469
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos and you talk and you talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people on a podcast,</v>

470
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

471
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting better at it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>strangers and shit.</v>

474
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get uncomfortable when you do </v>

<v Speaker 1>podcasts like this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this make you and go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like last time I did your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came in here and I talked to you and </v>

492
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:27.204
<v Speaker 1>then I left and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what the content of the </v>

493
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:34.250
<v Speaker 1>conversation I just had was when I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

494
00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:35.084
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were already baked out of your mind </v>

495
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 1>when I got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true too.</v>

496
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.623
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember much of what we talked </v>

497
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 1>about either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was good.</v>

498
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:43.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

500
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it.</v>

501
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to watch it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch them.</v>

503
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

504
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 1>usually I will watch everything that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and just am in love with the sound of</v>

505
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 1>my own voice and obsessive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

506
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.703
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

507
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.280
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shall,</v>

508
00:19:57.281 --> 00:19:58.114
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't watch it just because I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand like I can't watch my CNN </v>

509
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 1>appearance either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do CNN about?</v>

510
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on CNN because they were doing,</v>

511
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 1>there was like a new poll out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that the faith was on the decline</v>

512
00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had me on there,</v>

513
00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately I was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>on 30 minutes,</v>

514
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately that was the day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

515
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratzinger resigned.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so that it got preempted for that shit.</v>

517
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>But I was on for about four minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

518
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:26.454
<v Speaker 1>I had like an argument with a William </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lane Craig about statistics and you </v>

519
00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:33.990
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Lane Craig,</v>

520
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.400
<v Speaker 1>he's a Christian apologist piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

521
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 1>He's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just wretched.</v>

522
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.640
<v Speaker 1>You can watch him debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so good.</v>

527
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Just the name William Lane Craig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like settle down buddy here.</v>

528
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not just William Craig?</v>

529
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:58.594
<v Speaker 2>Why you got through that lane in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're married to someone whose </v>

530
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 2>last name is lane and that's always a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

531
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.610
<v Speaker 2>A hyphenated marriages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit just seems like someone's like</v>

532
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is an oil wrestling match.</v>

533
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are going to lose.</v>

534
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>

535
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Too much struggle for power there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

536
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.593
<v Speaker 2>Hyphenated name plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do if you have what I mean </v>

537
00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Well what happens when it compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like the kids are born.</v>

539
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Do they take the hyphenated name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

540
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.043
<v Speaker 2>And then what if they meet and fall in </v>
<v Speaker 2>love with someone else who has a </v>

541
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:28.924
<v Speaker 2>hyphenated name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they then have like four last names </v>

542
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:32.890
<v Speaker 2>with 300 kids in it?</v>

543
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.723
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like so is it just compound over </v>

544
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 2>time like until eventually everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single last name.</v>

545
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Just hyphenated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

546
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 2>If everybody was so greedy and wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be special the way those assholes do,</v>

547
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.970
<v Speaker 2>we would all have hyphenated names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

548
00:21:46.971 --> 00:21:50.260
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just get rid of the fucking name,</v>

549
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>change shit and just argue about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids are going to be named.</v>

550
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:53.794
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about people changing </v>

551
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:55.624
<v Speaker 2>their names?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if you just decided like I </v>

552
00:21:57.971 --> 00:22:00.370
<v Speaker 2>want to change my whole name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm based in last,</v>

553
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 2>might want to become a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad changed his name.</v>

554
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.241
<v Speaker 2>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

555
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 2>it did have a crazy last name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hard to pronounce.</v>

556
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that my grandfather,</v>

557
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Thomas James Kirk the third,</v>

558
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the first person in my family to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that name.</v>

559
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

560
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.470
<v Speaker 2>what happened was my grandfather was </v>
<v Speaker 2>named James Vardaman,</v>

561
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:25.471
<v Speaker 2>Kirk James Kirk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when my dad was James Vardaman,</v>

562
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:31.441
<v Speaker 2>Kurt junior star trek came out at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and he's James Kirk.</v>

563
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 2>So he's getting star trek jokes nonstop </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

564
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Finally he was in France and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ordered up some champagne.</v>

565
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:43.324
<v Speaker 2>It was Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's impressing a young woman and </v>

566
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh it,</v>

567
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 2>we'll beam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right up sir.</v>

568
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.650
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this name.</v>

569
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I got to get rid of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was born,</v>

570
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas James Kirk the third,</v>

571
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 2>because he knew he was changing his name</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Thomas James Kirk Junior,</v>

572
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't actually officially change</v>
<v Speaker 2>it till after I was born.</v>

573
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 2>So even though I'm the third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually the first.</v>

574
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

575
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 2>No one would ever guess that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute test.</v>

576
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would sneak that one right through.</v>

577
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.873
<v Speaker 2>That's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like there's no one probably </v>

578
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 2>today that's named Rick James.</v>

579
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Like anyone born after the Chappelle </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

580
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking way anyone who saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chappelle show was named their kid,</v>

581
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Rick James.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

582
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>if your last name's James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to name your boy rick.</v>

583
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

602
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.653

00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 2>people just fucking get that shit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their head and they want to hear it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you see it?</v>

609
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:29.643
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I didn't.</v>

610
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even watch the old one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he'll fucking go around like he'll,</v>

611

<v Speaker 2>You know he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

613
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a trademark.</v>

614
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 2>That's his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got scared of it.</v>

615
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.183
<v Speaker 2>I love the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a rally where someone threw </v>

616
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 2>eggs at Arnold Schwartzenegger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They threw eggs.</v>

617
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they threw eggs and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his suit and he's like,</v>

618
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 2>well that's what's great about America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they owe me some bacon.</v>

619
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

620
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

621
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 2>You're so fucking smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnold.</v>

622
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 2>You should be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Threw eggs at them.</v>

623
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind people just looking for a </v>

624
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:02.660
<v Speaker 2>reason to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pissed because Arnold,</v>

625
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.583
<v Speaker 2>he's the problem in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnold fucking Schwartzenegger was he a </v>

626
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 2>good governor now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was he a bad governor?</v>

627
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.793
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

628
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.270
<v Speaker 2>It was just half assed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half assed,</v>

629
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 2>mediocre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Governor,</v>

630
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.213
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump in later in life without going </v>

631
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:21.180
<v Speaker 2>through the river of politics first?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

632
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 2>house of cards style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of done it.</v>

633
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.620
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But housing,</v>

634
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean is it going to work?</v>

635
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.420
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Arnold Schwarzenegger got into like</v>

636
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:31.730
<v Speaker 2>in the relationship to the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.500
<v Speaker 2>the same sort of situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

638
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 2>does it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

639
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 2>it works enough to where he's president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

640
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

641
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 2>it worked that well.</v>

642
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his approval ratings are kind of dog </v>

643
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they always were.</v>

644
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.620
<v Speaker 2>But like when you say whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnold Schwarzenegger was a good,</v>

645
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 2>good governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

646
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to like really look into </v>

647
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:52.851
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

648
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:53.684
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

649
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big thing was that,</v>

650
00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

651
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.420
<v Speaker 2>he tried to pass all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the laws is not really the word </v>

653
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll use that.</v>

654
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.660
<v Speaker 2>He tried to pass all these like laws and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

655
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.503
<v Speaker 2>they all failed at the ballot and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people said he was done and he would </v>

656
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:13.034
<v Speaker 2>just went out and like he went out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a speech that almost gave you the </v>

657
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.230
<v Speaker 2>impression like he'd been against them </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the start.</v>

658
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these terrible laws,</v>

659
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:22.790
<v Speaker 2>they are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

660
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the one who pushed them,</v>

661
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.993
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

662
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 2>He was really smooth that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

663
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 2>operating with crowds and just knew what</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

664
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right attitude to strike.</v>

665
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.930
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of actually governing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just mediocre.</v>

666
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really get much done </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislatively,</v>

667
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't really a disaster either.</v>

668
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I was thinking like,</v>

669
00:26:42.431 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder how difficult it is to get things</v>

670
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:45.834
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd only be guessing like sitting </v>

671
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 2>here on the outside and that guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking to,</v>

672
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 2>like Obama was a piece of shit like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a guy.</v>

673
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of it,</v>

674
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 2>how much of it do you think he really </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasps?</v>

675
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

676
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:02.781
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody who's not doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>grasps how complex that system,</v>

677
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I probably both know that the </v>

678
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.520
<v Speaker 2>more people you involve in any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor or project,</v>

679
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:09.803
<v Speaker 2>the more difficult it becomes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're managing all these different </v>

680
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 2>interests for sure.</v>

681
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 2>president or governor or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

683
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you have so many people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be representing and they all</v>

684
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 2>have different ideas and there they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have their own,</v>

685
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other legislators who have their</v>

686
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 2>agendas and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably pretty difficult to get</v>

687
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:29.994
<v Speaker 2>much of anything done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine the stress of that </v>

688
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

689
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 2>just a mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

690
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:37.704
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's been golfing so many times just </v>

691
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 2>to try to relieve stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

692
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:41.523
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

693
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he criticized Obama for golfing too much</v>

694
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 2>and now trump's like a big avid golfer.</v>

695
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

696
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 2>the guy's 70 years old to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would even want to take this on with</v>

697
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.370
<v Speaker 2>all that money and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

698
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.380
<v Speaker 2>all that power already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

699
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 2>why would he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would he want to be the president?</v>

700
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like such a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>helacious job.</v>

701
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.293
<v Speaker 2>Unless he really feels like he can fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>things or he's really gonna make a ton </v>

702
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 2>of money from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a guy who plasters is his</v>

703
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:17.280
<v Speaker 2>fucking name on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on hildings and shit,</v>

704
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:18.900
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's really just a matter for</v>

705
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:21.750
<v Speaker 2>him of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is part of my legacy.</v>

706
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.573
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the end of my life I was </v>

707
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:26.970
<v Speaker 2>president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

708
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another version of what many people</v>

709
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:36.801
<v Speaker 2>did with Obama in this weird way in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Obama got into office,</v>

710
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:38.124
<v Speaker 2>there was all these like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really irrational people that said all </v>

711
00:28:41.251 --> 00:28:42.180
<v Speaker 2>kinds of crazy shit.</v>

712
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.190
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was amongst them.</v>

713
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:45.450
<v Speaker 2>He was a birther.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

714
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 2>he was a member for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was convinced.</v>

715
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Somebody convinced him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno who convinced him.</v>

716
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.073
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno if you've really relinquished it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and realize that it was wrong or if he </v>

717
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:58.530
<v Speaker 2>still holds on to the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he ever really believe it too?</v>

718
00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

719
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:00.863
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know who started that whole </v>

720
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:03.990
<v Speaker 2>birther thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton.</v>

721
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she did.</v>

722
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that people forget.</v>

723
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.000
<v Speaker 2>It was during the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

724
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:08.834
<v Speaker 2>the campaign between her and a Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were trying to get the </v>

725
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 2>nomination in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

726
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

727
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:16.104
<v Speaker 2>she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well she had one of her little org send </v>

728
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:19.134
<v Speaker 2>out materials that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed Obama and like the like he was </v>

729
00:29:21.931 --> 00:29:25.530
<v Speaker 2>wearing like some African Muslim garb </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

730
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Cause he went on a visit to some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>co.</v>

731
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 2>You look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 2>he's Muslim and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

733
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.660
<v Speaker 2>and trump just ran with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

734
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Or a lot of Republicans did to cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

735
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:38.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I guess that's just how they play </v>

736
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.060
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have some like that,</v>

737
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 2>they just run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so strange to see when you got</v>

738
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 2>to Canada named Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's easy.</v>

739
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hussein Obama,</v>

740
00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:56.420
<v Speaker 2>like Barack Hussein Obama Sane in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to guide it,</v>

741
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran a rack and Obama,</v>

742
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.133
<v Speaker 2>it had the similar to the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that crashed those planes into the </v>

743
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 2>towers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

744
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 2>somebody had a joe really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well wrote a joke.</v>

745
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.293
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who it was though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have been Tony Hinchcliffe but </v>

746
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

747
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 2>this is almost a s a similar reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean it's less,</v>

748
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it's more rational or less rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is almost like the energy of</v>

749
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:20.614
<v Speaker 2>the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the energy of the birthers and the </v>

750
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:23.944
<v Speaker 2>guys who were convinced that he was some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of undercover Muslim and then he </v>

751
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:27.664
<v Speaker 2>was going to get into the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to take America down from the </v>

752
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>

753
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.543
<v Speaker 2>Like that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the amount of energy that way his </v>

754
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:36.010
<v Speaker 2>mirror now on the left maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

755
00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even past,</v>

756
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I would say probably I might not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>right because I might not be remembering</v>

757
00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:42.994
<v Speaker 2>it perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like the energy on the left </v>

758
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:49.420
<v Speaker 2>of people getting mad at trump is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful or more,</v>

759
00:30:49.421 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 2>there's more to it than the energy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw from people on the right.</v>

760
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:55.700
<v Speaker 2>They wanted Obama out of office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might just be my memory.</v>

761
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta remember too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an age gap there.</v>

762
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

763
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.830
<v Speaker 2>most of the people who were talking this</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit about Obama were,</v>

764
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.260
<v Speaker 2>were pretty old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

765
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the people now that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed or really young,</v>

766
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:06.814
<v Speaker 2>so they're more likely to take to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets and smash things and hold up </v>

767
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:12.650
<v Speaker 2>signs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 2>act wild and shit and mace people.</v>

769
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:15.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

770
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 2>when Bush took office though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when Bush,</v>

771
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

772
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 2>was being inaugurated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that he was driving down,</v>

773
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:24.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

774
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:26.500
<v Speaker 2>to the White House during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inauguration day.</v>

775
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:28.391
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trump,</v>

777
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:31.800
<v Speaker 2>the protesters kinda came the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with,</v>

778
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.643
<v Speaker 2>when Bush was inaugurated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protesters were all there the day </v>

779
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:35.370
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

780
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.213
<v Speaker 2>Bush couldn't even do the little </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional walk down the last few </v>

781
00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:40.384
<v Speaker 2>blocks of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the journey because there was so many </v>

782
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:42.784
<v Speaker 2>protestors and people were just throwing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things at the fucking motorcade and </v>

783
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean like this is not unusual,</v>

784
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.440
<v Speaker 2>but that was towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that was the very beginning.</v>

785
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 2>What am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which 1:00 AM I thinking of?</v>

786
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there one towards the very end?</v>

787
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.323
<v Speaker 3>The W</v>

788
00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I think we're thinking of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

789
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm,</v>

790
00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:04.514
<v Speaker 2>my memory's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there was one towards the </v>

791
00:32:06.741 --> 00:32:11.741
<v Speaker 2>end where they had planned on having him</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk down some long stretch and they had</v>

792
00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:14.360
<v Speaker 2>to abandon it and get them into a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the same stores?</v>

793
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

794
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that was both times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the first,</v>

795
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:18.770
<v Speaker 2>but even during his first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

796
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.873
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when he was just first being </v>

797
00:32:20.481 --> 00:32:25.481
<v Speaker 2>inaugurated president in 2000 so right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after Clinton that inauguration was bad.</v>

798
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.230
<v Speaker 2>It was almost the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

799
00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:28.064
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost the same as what you see </v>

800
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.053
<v Speaker 2>now because people had had this Democrat</v>
<v Speaker 2>in power for eight years and they </v>

801
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.300
<v Speaker 2>thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

802
00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.600
<v Speaker 2>And they thought Gore is a shoe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Clinton's popular,</v>

803
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 2>just same</v>

804
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.740
<v Speaker 4>as like Hillary's a shoe in because </v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama's popular.</v>

805
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

806
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Republican ended up taking,</v>

807
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking it and,</v>

808
00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.013
<v Speaker 4>and they just freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like that always just </v>

809
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:53.181
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

810
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:54.014
<v Speaker 4>like this kind of like backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it always is kind of sold to us as </v>

811
00:32:58.341 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is new,</v>

812
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow,</v>

813
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:01.994
<v Speaker 4>look at what's going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't this crazy what crazy times we </v>

814
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 4>live in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

815
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 4>I look back at my memories of the past </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it seems like this is pretty par for</v>

816
00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:09.980
<v Speaker 4>the course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right,</v>

817
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.143
<v Speaker 4>now that I'm thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like we go through these </v>

818
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:13.910
<v Speaker 4>like cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

819
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.820
<v Speaker 4>And if a president gets past one cycle </v>
<v Speaker 4>removed from his,</v>

820
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.200
<v Speaker 4>his tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then people forgive them.</v>

821
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 4>They forget and they changed their </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>

822
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Reagan,</v>

823
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 4>like man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>

824
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 4>Reagan was a pariah.</v>

825
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 4>Like people were so upset about Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were so upset.</v>

826
00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 4>And there was the contra versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nicaragua,</v>

827
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.284
<v Speaker 4>a trial that was on television with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Oliver North and we were finding out on </v>

828
00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:45.134
<v Speaker 4>tv like whether or not the government </v>
<v Speaker 4>had sold arms and lied about it and </v>

829
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:52.880
<v Speaker 4>weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

830
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:53.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

831
00:33:53.521 --> 00:33:56.510
<v Speaker 4>the whole Reagan thing with winning that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reagan sold arms to Iran,</v>

832
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.433
<v Speaker 4>the great Jimmy Tangle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious standup comedian and Boston </v>

833
00:33:59.171 --> 00:34:00.004
<v Speaker 4>has this bit about it because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was when Reagan started claiming </v>

834
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 4>all timers or when he claimed memory </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>

835
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.550
<v Speaker 4>which turned out to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

836
00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 4>you really did have memory issues and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably did it at a time,</v>

837
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.200
<v Speaker 4>but they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you sell arms to Iraq?</v>

838
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:13.821
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

839
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 4>And Timmy tangles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like mister president,</v>

840
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 4>if you ever sell arms to people who hate</v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

841
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.220
<v Speaker 4>jot it down.</v>

842
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a note,</v>

843
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 4>put it on the refrigerator today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sold Amz to people who hate me.</v>

844
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.440
<v Speaker 4>You have to hear him say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

845
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:31.274
<v Speaker 4>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to realize that like America's </v>

846
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 4>always has been a huge arms dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

847
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 4>we're constantly selling weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

848
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean like if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he didn't remember why he did it,</v>

849
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 4>it's probably because there were just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>many other transactions.</v>

850
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.513
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the president personally </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets involved too much in that sort of </v>

851
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:47.330
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but probably not.</v>

852
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Country sells weapons all over the place</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we continue to do that.</v>

853
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point was that like eight years later</v>

854
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.660
<v Speaker 4>he was the great Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

855
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Eight years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and eyes,</v>

856
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.510
<v Speaker 4>he goes through the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>

857
00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:00.344
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's done with the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting his dick sucked and the White </v>

858
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.630
<v Speaker 4>House and all that craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

859
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 4>and then as soon as that's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people start reminiscing to Reagan.</v>

860
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting how we do it.</v>

861
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.120
<v Speaker 4>And so now Bush went through this period</v>
<v Speaker 4>of being hated and he's out of office at</v>

862
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:17.954
<v Speaker 4>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes through his period of being hated </v>

863
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 4>for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now that,</v>

864
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 4>and even more unreasonable Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 4>in office people long to the Bush days.</v>

865
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.193
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you noticed they're trotting Bush </v>

866
00:35:28.221 --> 00:35:30.080
<v Speaker 4>out and doing interviews with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

867
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:30.973
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember this war criminal now he's </v>

868
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:33.380
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

869
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 4>he's an uncle Bush the bush here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uncle Bush go set you on his knee.</v>

870
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 2>They um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super imposed.</v>

871
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:43.470
<v Speaker 2>What does that protests during the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration now figurations.</v>

872
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

873
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

874
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

875
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:49.730
<v Speaker 2>buck flush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flush.</v>

876
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.680
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not my president of course.</v>

877
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

878
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

879
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 2>this is all so cyclic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

880
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It just happens over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think it's new and you know,</v>

881
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 2>for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

882
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's the country just has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>short memory to what a crazy show.</v>

883
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:08.364
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy show we're watching the </v>

884
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:13.190
<v Speaker 2>battle to control the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

885
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Political Theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pageantry.</v>

886
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just,</v>

887
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:18.204
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I don't want to get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you already had Alex Jones on the </v>

888
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't really get into that level of</v>

889
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I do agree that these parties</v>

890
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:27.984
<v Speaker 2>are constantly just working together </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes and that 90% of the </v>

891
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:32.214
<v Speaker 2>issues they agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just make a big spectacle of the </v>

892
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 2>little things they actually disagree on </v>
<v Speaker 2>to distract us with a show.</v>

893
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.300
<v Speaker 2>You Look America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

894
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 2>look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting,</v>

895
00:36:42.391 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they stopped paying attention?</v>

896
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we've met,</v>

897
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 2>now we do the real deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are we going to bomb?</v>

898
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Who we going to invade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

899
00:36:50.051 --> 00:36:50.884
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were going to sell weapons to </v>

900
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

901
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 2>It's probably definitely some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

902
00:36:56.551 --> 00:36:58.740
<v Speaker 2>if they're all working together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watch house of cards,</v>

903
00:36:58.770 --> 00:36:59.980
<v Speaker 2>do you watch house of cards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

904
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.893

<v Speaker 2>but when he started pushing people in </v>

905

<v Speaker 2>front of trains and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>car so you can control the music with </v>

961
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 2>double annoying for the driver I would </v>

<v Speaker 2>I've never taken that right.</v>

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.793
<v Speaker 2>So you let them just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just let them do what they do over </v>

966
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.493
<v Speaker 2>with the shitty music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause I mean at the end of the </v>

967
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:08.763
<v Speaker 2>day they're the ones who have to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in this fucking car all day and </v>

968
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm just getting a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like an asshole being like,</v>

969
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.313
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pose my musical tastes on </v>

970
00:39:15.341 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you cause I feel like it's their car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever there.</v>

971
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Well it's definitely their car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

972
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:26.821
<v Speaker 2>what's weird is why is music suck to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's great to some people.</v>

973
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about a song that you go,</v>

974
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 2>oh that's a fucking great song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone else would go turn that off.</v>

975
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it,</v>

976
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.530
<v Speaker 2>it kind of reminds me of something with </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

977
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Like people have different food </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences and shit and I was wondering</v>

978
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating a pickle and you know,</v>

979
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other people hate pickles.</v>

980
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.873
<v Speaker 2>So when they eat a pickle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it taste different to them than it </v>

981
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:52.324
<v Speaker 2>does to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it the same taste but they just </v>

982
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 2>don't like that taste?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

983
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of wonder the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the music thing.</v>

984
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure.</v>

985
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

986
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:03.933
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a visual thing too and </v>

987
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:06.064
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not visual in terms of like taking </v>

988
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:10.870
<v Speaker 2>account of space and mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but visual and account of like what,</v>

989
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.210
<v Speaker 2>what each individual image does for you.</v>

990
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Like how it looks too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

991
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I like the overall feeling it gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different for everybody.</v>

992
00:40:18.021 --> 00:40:19.690
<v Speaker 2>It just has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be,</v>

993
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:20.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it,</v>

994
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 2>what else would account for all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different tastes?</v>

995
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the obvious different,</v>

996
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 2>especially music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then this like tastes that you very,</v>

997
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:28.474
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you ever catch yourself in some </v>

998
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:30.904
<v Speaker 2>weird mix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you hit ipod shuffle or something </v>

999
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 2>like that and you catch some weird mix </v>
<v Speaker 2>of songs that you like and you're like,</v>

1000
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:36.970
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just do not go together.</v>

1001
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Like these two are just really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back to back.</v>

1002
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1003
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.160
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the food thing,</v>

1004
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:42.551
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1005
00:40:42.551 --> 00:40:46.060
<v Speaker 2>there's certain foods you might like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe together they're not so great.</v>

1006
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1007
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.063
<v Speaker 2>And then certain foods you would think </v>
<v Speaker 2>would not be good together but are </v>

1008
00:40:49.691 --> 00:40:54.430
<v Speaker 2>amazing like a pineapple and anchovies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1009
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.323
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1010
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't like either of those by </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1011
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 2>So dude on pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high end apple anchovy pizza.</v>

1023
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Bacon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1024
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.890
<v Speaker 2>if you go to Canada and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want some bacon.</v>

1025
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:28.650

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1027
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a Belgium waffle.</v>

1028
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Why is it from Belgium?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a god there isn't a waffle.</v>

1029
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.293
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucked up thing is I went to </v>

1030
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:37.064
<v Speaker 2>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got a waffle there and it's </v>

1031
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:41.810
<v Speaker 2>nothing like what they fucking say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that we Belgian waffles here,</v>

1032
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 2>they're like round and you put it on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plate with syrup.</v>

1033
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 2>They give you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like street food there.</v>

1034
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 2>You get like a little tiny fork and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a small waffle,</v>

1035
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not even round.</v>

1036
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.210
<v Speaker 2>And they put whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just syrup.</v>

1037
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:54.044
<v Speaker 2>They'll put like fresh strawberries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of shit on there and you just </v>

1038
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.750
<v Speaker 2>sit there and eat it with this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny ridiculous fork.</v>

1039
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:01.243
<v Speaker 2>And it's totally different than what </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called a Belgian waffle in </v>

1040
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:05.300
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like one of those,</v>

1041
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:06.134
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever go to one of those crepe </v>

1042
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 2>stands?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.840
<v Speaker 2>it's in the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1044
00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:10.683
<v Speaker 2>like they make you a little crepes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>waffles and stuff and they put new tell </v>

1045
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:13.604
<v Speaker 2>autumn and the watch different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's probably closer to </v>

1046
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 2>That's God damn delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way better than a Belgium waffle.</v>

1048
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.963
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at Belgium [inaudible] was easy to </v>

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing from the tray.</v>

1165
00:47:31.811 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Can She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and were like,</v>

1166
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and he kept asking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it airborne?</v>

1167
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Is the nut allergy airborne?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people have an airborne nut out.</v>

1168
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she doesn't,</v>

1169
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:43.300
<v Speaker 2>and she told him that and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent and he wouldn't,</v>

1170
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:45.910
<v Speaker 2>he'd like ask it but not wait for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>

1171
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd come back and he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally pleasant.</v>

1172
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you guys on the Dah,</v>

1173
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dah.</v>

1174
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd leave any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back again and he'd be crazy again.</v>

1175
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Like she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she held up her glass.</v>

1176
00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.433
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like refilling and her glass kind </v>

1177
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 2>of far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she like,</v>

1178
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holds it out.</v>

1179
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that back on the table,</v>

1180
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.870
<v Speaker 2>put that back on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1181
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1182
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.753
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole city though was high strung </v>

1183
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.773
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I remember I went to a pot shop </v>

1184
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:17.920
<v Speaker 2>there and the guy at the pot shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1185
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 2>first of all you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to a waiting room,</v>

1186
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Speaker 2>which is just weird and like take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

1187
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:25.263
<v Speaker 2>And then I was called into another room </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I thought it was gonna be able to </v>

1188
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:27.964
<v Speaker 2>buy weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead it was just another waiting </v>

1189
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:30.934
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I finally get to the fucking </v>

1190
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.353
<v Speaker 2>little broom closet where they keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>their meager supply a fucking weed and </v>

1191
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:42.820
<v Speaker 2>there's this guy behind the counter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he know shit was like,</v>

1192
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1193
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please watch.</v>

1194
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And then we had four people with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He proceeds to do it to everybody.</v>

1195
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 2>So four times in a row,</v>

1196
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

1197
00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

1198
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I smoke weed to like chill out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>relax and shit,</v>

1199
00:49:04.321 --> 00:49:05.290
<v Speaker 2>but you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1200
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:06.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1201
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.583
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's bitching about how hard his job is </v>

1202
00:49:08.851 --> 00:49:09.361
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1203
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:10.194
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait till we get off works that </v>

1204
00:49:11.191 --> 00:49:12.024
<v Speaker 2>we could get really high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're already high but we're </v>

1205
00:49:15.211 --> 00:49:16.044
<v Speaker 2>going keep it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy gets a vote to and then there </v>

1206
00:49:18.811 --> 00:49:20.610
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was leaving that fucking place,</v>

1207
00:49:20.611 --> 00:49:24.960
<v Speaker 2>there was like a syringe like on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor of the fucking weed shop.</v>

1208
00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Colorado.</v>

1209
00:49:26.971 --> 00:49:29.910
<v Speaker 2>We'd shit as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's way better in Washington.</v>

1210
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.870
<v Speaker 2>You just go into a fucking store like </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other store and buy it.</v>

1211
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:34.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're worried about more </v>

1212
00:49:35.401 --> 00:49:36.234
<v Speaker 2>than anything is people robbing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's probably why they make you </v>

1213
00:49:38.551 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 2>go through steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like step one and step two.</v>

1214
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phased introduction.</v>

1215
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean also they can isolate you from </v>

1216
00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:48.660
<v Speaker 2>the outside if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have cameras,</v>

1217
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:49.613
<v Speaker 2>the cameras are monitoring you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably makes people less likely </v>

1218
00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:55.410
<v Speaker 2>to try to attempt an armed robbery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1219
00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:57.770
<v Speaker 2>But you could arm robbed any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>place I made.</v>

1220
00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1221
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it was exclusive to weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>shop for sure.</v>

1222
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just a scary thing what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing where they're not allowing them to</v>

1223
00:50:05.371 --> 00:50:06.204
<v Speaker 2>use credit cards so that they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep large chunks cash around and I </v>

1224
00:50:10.021 --> 00:50:12.150
<v Speaker 2>think they're trying to resolve that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they have yet,</v>

1225
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.193
<v Speaker 2>but it was a giant issue for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they would have to hire these </v>

1226
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:16.503
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1227
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.710
<v Speaker 2>like mercenaries essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:50:19.711 --> 00:50:21.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who worked for like black water and</v>

1229
00:50:21.441 --> 00:50:22.274
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kind of guys to carry the money </v>

1230
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:27.140
<v Speaker 2>around or to guard the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying the money around.</v>

1231
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear</v>

1232
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.980
<v Speaker 4>a jeff sessions recently saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is a dis,</v>

1233
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.963
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a destructive fucking drug </v>

1234
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 4>that is almost as bad as heroin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 4>He said that to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it today or yesterday?</v>

1236
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:48.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it was either today or yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he said,</v>

1237
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.093
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious that this guy is in </v>

1238
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 4>charge of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only slightly less awful.</v>

1239
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:56.270
<v Speaker 4>Was his words only slightly less off of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the heroin.</v>

1240
00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Someone is without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's what he's expressing,</v>

1241
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:02.660
<v Speaker 4>someones without a doubt influencing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1242
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more than just his opinion here.</v>

1243
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 4>This is not these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when these,</v>

1244
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:09.014
<v Speaker 4>they have these meetings when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing policy or the discussing how </v>

1245
00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:13.334
<v Speaker 4>they proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this isn't as simple as this one </v>

1246
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 4>wacky dude's opinion and they leave him </v>
<v Speaker 4>alone with his opinion.</v>

1247
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.180
<v Speaker 4>He has ultimate power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

1248
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.250
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of vested interests.</v>

1249
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.083
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of money at stake and </v>

1250
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.490
<v Speaker 4>would lose money if marijuana was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is 100% why that guy was doing it.</v>

1251
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.333
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1252
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.413
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his personal opinion towards weed has </v>

1253
00:51:33.771 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 4>always been mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was at lie like that.</v>

1254
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:38.294
<v Speaker 4>Like that's just a fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have any data to show that </v>

1255
00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 4>that's even remotely true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heroin kills fuck loads of people.</v>

1256
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their bodies are ravaged by it.</v>

1257
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 4>Pot doesn't do a goddamn thing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might make you a little loony.</v>

1258
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

1259
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1260
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not even comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1261
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:58.620
<v Speaker 4>And if you might be schizophrenia exams </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they looked at all the,</v>

1262
00:51:58.621 --> 00:52:00.070
<v Speaker 4>the population and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1263
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 4>marijuana contributes to schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1264
00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:02.361
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1265
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 4>actually no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the number,</v>

1266
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 4>it's always 1% and it feels 1% of </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking pot or not smoking pot.</v>

1267
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.983
<v Speaker 4>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the schizophrenia numbers have always </v>

1268
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 4>been around 1%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean like it can be exacerbated by </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

1270
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not,</v>

1271
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.990
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't cause it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1272
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:18.990
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1273
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a brain scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nor are you,</v>

1274
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.090
<v Speaker 4>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>

1275
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1276
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:24.080
<v Speaker 4>I've dealt with schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>

1277
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:24.941
<v Speaker 4>you know them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1278
00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:25.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 4>I've known a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1280
00:52:26.991 --> 00:52:27.824
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it probably varies like any </v>

1281
00:52:29.391 --> 00:52:30.224
<v Speaker 4>other kind of mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what pisses me off though more than </v>

1282
00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:32.954
<v Speaker 4>even like the personal angle of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pot smoker and this affects me </v>

1283
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:37.130
<v Speaker 4>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1284
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:37.964
<v Speaker 4>that does get my goat a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what really pisses me off is that </v>

1285
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.910
<v Speaker 4>trump is mr jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:44.803
<v Speaker 4>This industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this $7 billion recreational marijuana </v>

1287
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:50.990
<v Speaker 4>industry is employing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1288
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 4>like a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>150 people.</v>

1289
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1290
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:59.050
<v Speaker 4>part time and full time that are along </v>
<v Speaker 4>some rung of the ladder of like,</v>

1291
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:00.650
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1292
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:01.483
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either they're working for the growers </v>

1293
00:53:02.781 --> 00:53:06.830
<v Speaker 4>or they're doing the packaging are there</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping with the shipping.</v>

1294
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.820
<v Speaker 4>So this is like a huge job creator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge money maker.</v>

1295
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 4>This is what trump ran on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump's like,</v>

1296
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.253
<v Speaker 4>I'm the jobs president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to bring jobs back if they go </v>

1297
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:18.824
<v Speaker 4>after this industry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the exact opposite of bringing </v>

1298
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:23.430
<v Speaker 4>jobs back that's shutting jobs down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 4>What's shutting jobs down though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>With a</v>

1300
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 2>kind of people that we don't really want</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the first place?</v>

1301
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:30.643
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

1302
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.273
<v Speaker 2>they can sort of surmise that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are running pot shops are probably </v>

1303
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:36.360
<v Speaker 2>pretty left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty quickly.</v>

1305
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're making almost,</v>

1306
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you're making more money for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition,</v>

1307
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 2>whereas the pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1308
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:44.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're nonpartisan.</v>

1309
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget the alcohol and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1310
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of them.</v>

1311
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.660
<v Speaker 2>The prison unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison guard unions.</v>

1312
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:52.643
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find out that prison guard unions </v>

1313
00:53:54.091 --> 00:53:55.670
<v Speaker 2>have worked to try to keep marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

1314
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.550
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1315
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:57.743
<v Speaker 2>Like what you're really saying is we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to extract money by putting people </v>

1316
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:02.550
<v Speaker 2>in cages and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really saying that's what you get</v>

1317
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:06.290
<v Speaker 2>when you do a private prison industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit,</v>

1318
00:54:06.291 --> 00:54:06.931
<v Speaker 2>Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1319
00:54:06.931 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 2>I've done videos about this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>private prison industry.</v>

1320
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.130
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1321
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm always surprised by just how tap it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the responses.</v>

1322
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.663
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1323
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1324
00:54:16.201 --> 00:54:17.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners who gives a shit.</v>

1325
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.241
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1326
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 2>but what about the fact that plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't belong to be there?</v>

1327
00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:21.474
<v Speaker 2>What about the fact that these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who run these prison industries </v>

1328
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.833
<v Speaker 2>sponsored legislation to put more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in jail in a country that already has </v>

1329
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:28.824
<v Speaker 2>the disproportionately highest prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>population of any country on the planet </v>

1330
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 2>while claiming to be the fucking land of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free?</v>

1331
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put a fuck load of people in jail.</v>

1332
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Tons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what,</v>

1333
00:54:38.511 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this statistic?</v>

1334
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:40.523
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some bananas thing about the percentage </v>

1335
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:43.254
<v Speaker 2>of people to the United States puts in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail as opposed to the rest of the </v>

1336
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:48.780
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the rest of the world kills people.</v>

1337
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1338
00:54:49.561 --> 00:54:50.790
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't bother me.</v>

1339
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't bother locking you up as much in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other countries.</v>

1340
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:55.980
<v Speaker 2>They just take out in the back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shoot you in the head.</v>

1341
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.700
<v Speaker 2>So you know that mass grave they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>found no,</v>

1342
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Speaker 2>they found a mass grave in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

1343
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 2>really bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they've found has made 200 as</v>

1344
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:08.490
<v Speaker 2>many as 250 bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cartels or,</v>

1345
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find that Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a creepy story man,</v>

1347
00:55:13.591 --> 00:55:17.340
<v Speaker 2>because some teachers found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were looking for something else and</v>

1348
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:18.174
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they just found some bones and </v>

1349
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:20.124
<v Speaker 2>they started digging in and they've only</v>
<v Speaker 2>done like an excavation of a certain </v>

1350
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the land too that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at and then look,</v>

1351
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:28.974
<v Speaker 2>it might be as much so there could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>extensive mass graves throughout the </v>

1352
00:55:31.531 --> 00:55:33.030
<v Speaker 2>entire area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1353
00:55:33.031 --> 00:55:33.864
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know this existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is more than 250 human skulls </v>

1354
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 2>found in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1355
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mass grave containing more than 250 </v>

1356
00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:45.000
<v Speaker 2>human skulls was uncovered in central </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

1357
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Most likely the victim of drug cartels </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years of Jesus.</v>

1358
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Either then or one very prolific serial </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>

1359
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:55.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a guy who's really getting shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1360
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is terrifying,</v>

1361
00:55:57.961 --> 00:56:00.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really terrifying that this,</v>

1362
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.673
<v Speaker 2>this massive drug war is happening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuel the illegal drug market over here </v>

1363
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 2>and it's happening with a country that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to us.</v>

1364
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 2>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like this massive issue going on,</v>

1365
00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:13.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1366
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.363
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think the build a wall </v>

1367
00:56:15.871 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric is so effective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1368
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just even more,</v>

1369
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.290
<v Speaker 2>well that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the least effective option.</v>

1370
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the best option</v>

1371
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 4>would be to make it legal and regulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and to let adults do whatever</v>

1372
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 4>the fuck they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if some asshole wants to take math,</v>

1373
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 4>let them take math.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them by math.</v>

1374
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can buy adderall already.</v>

1375
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these people who are doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy drugs,</v>

1376
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 4>they're only doing it because better </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs aren't available.</v>

1377
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 4>They can't find them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're too expensive.</v>

1378
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.333
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just legalize and regulate all </v>

1379
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:44.230
<v Speaker 4>these markets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are,</v>

1380
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:45.183
<v Speaker 4>we know for a fact are going to exist no</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter what because people are just </v>

1381
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 4>going to do fucking drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's legal or not legal.</v>

1382
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the only variable?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that I really worry about</v>

1383
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Speaker 4>though as opiates because I feel like if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you made opiates legal,</v>

1384
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:00.034
<v Speaker 4>if you made them more accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know way too many people have </v>

1385
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 4>lost their lives on them.</v>

1386
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:04.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know way too many people that have </v>

1387
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:06.394
<v Speaker 4>taken them and then they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing got real slippery and </v>

1388
00:57:10.331 --> 00:57:12.370
<v Speaker 4>they just started fucking up at work and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do,</v>

1389
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 4>we're on them all the time and they got </v>
<v Speaker 4>real foggy.</v>

1390
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1391
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:18.340
<v Speaker 4>we live in a country full of obese </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and uh,</v>

1392
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1393
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty obese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1394
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.233
<v Speaker 4>that's terrible for your health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not quite as bad as severe </v>

1395
00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:26.700
<v Speaker 4>opiate addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

1396
00:57:26.701 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 4>it's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1397
00:57:28.031 --> 00:57:28.864
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it leads to a whole plethora of health </v>

1398
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look,</v>

1399
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:31.864
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we live in either we believe that </v>

1400
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 4>people have the freedom to make their </v>
<v Speaker 4>own choices about their own bodies or we</v>

1401
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:37.990
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1402
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 4>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1403
00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:40.144
<v Speaker 4>even if there is negative repercussions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative repercussions to being pro </v>

1404
00:57:43.181 --> 00:57:45.100
<v Speaker 4>second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1405
00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:45.934
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do have more gun violence because of </v>

1406
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:47.770
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1407
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I still believe in the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do believe in probably more regulation</v>

1408
00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:52.444
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But do you just fucked up right there </v>

1409
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:54.960
<v Speaker 4>son?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1410
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.843
<v Speaker 4>he's opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Gates happened opening the gates of </v>

1411
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:57.724
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're smarter than the </v>

1412
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 4>founding fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking,</v>

1413
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:03.070
<v Speaker 4>were you going to update the Second </v>
<v Speaker 4>Amendment?</v>

1414
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:04.503
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already got the damn waffle house </v>

1415
00:58:05.201 --> 00:58:07.650
<v Speaker 4>waiter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We already updated a plenty of,</v>

1416
00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:09.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of the constitution.</v>

1417
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Not Officially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1418
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:14.020
<v Speaker 4>like the privacy clause that's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking gone.</v>

1419
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fourth amendment is just,</v>

1420
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1421
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 4>it's basically no and void at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

1422
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.613
<v Speaker 4>I don't want anybody doing heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that it should be </v>

1423
00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 4>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1424
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.270
<v Speaker 4>I think that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1425
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:31.090
<v Speaker 4>I bet in certain circumstances under </v>
<v Speaker 4>severe pain,</v>

1426
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 4>certain opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially like natural opiates probably</v>

1427
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:37.090
<v Speaker 4>feel wonderful if you have like a severe</v>
<v Speaker 4>back pain,</v>

1428
00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 4>you can't rast and you take something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that and you can,</v>

1429
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 4>the real problem is those fucking pills </v>
<v Speaker 4>get in people's DNA,</v>

1430
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:44.620
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1431
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.453
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get attached to you in some </v>

1432
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:49.340
<v Speaker 4>terrifying way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1433
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.673
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people get into the more than almost </v>

1434
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 4>anything I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they actually are like,</v>

1435
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:59.020
<v Speaker 4>the gateway drug thing is kind of mocked</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's attributed to weed.</v>

1436
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Those pills usually our gateway to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1437
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 4>begin injecting if they don't inject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they'll inject if it,</v>

1438
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 4>if it works just as good and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only way they can get it.</v>

1439
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:09.703
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened with a lot of </v>

1440
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:11.660
<v Speaker 4>people in Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

1441
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.170
<v Speaker 4>one of those episodes of Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bourdain's show,</v>

1442
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:17.470
<v Speaker 4>he was out like near,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what area of Massachusetts,</v>

1443
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 4>but it was all about how many people had</v>
<v Speaker 4>been devastated by heroin</v>

1444
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.903
<v Speaker 2>addiction and heroin overdoses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it came out of the </v>

1445
00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:26.880
<v Speaker 2>oxycontin addictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1446
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 2>They got the pills really easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when it became less,</v>

1447
00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:30.944
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay started cramp clamping down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations and made it harder for </v>

1448
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:34.634
<v Speaker 2>people to get prescriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people turn to heroin because they </v>

1449
00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 2>were addicted to opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1450
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a nap.</v>

1451
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:41.600
<v Speaker 2>It was just a part of who they were at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

1452
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole country right now,</v>

1453
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of there's a big opiate crisis,</v>

1454
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to,</v>

1455
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:48.853
<v Speaker 2>doctors are not writing as many of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>opiate prescriptions and if they're </v>

1456
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:51.824
<v Speaker 2>trying to make it harder to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot more people are turning to </v>

1457
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:54.344
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we just have a heroin crisis and </v>

1458
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:58.730
<v Speaker 2>people don't know how much to take and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're overdosing and dying.</v>

1459
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It's so spooky and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it was regulated,</v>

1460
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1461
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:07.490
<v Speaker 2>the same people who are already addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

1462
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:09.560
<v Speaker 2>who are already going to seek it out or </v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to find it?</v>

1463
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:10.933
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no stigma so they can actually </v>

1464
01:00:12.261 --> 01:00:14.960
<v Speaker 2>go seek fucking treatment for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1465
01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>

1466
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.543
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty difficult to admit you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin addict when you're scared that </v>

1467
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you might go to fucking jail just for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do.</v>

1468
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:23.023
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't use the best stuff to get </v>

1469
01:00:24.381 --> 01:00:26.000
<v Speaker 2>people off drugs anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1470
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.043
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly the most effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not from my personal </v>

1471
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:29.804
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the most effective drug to get </v>

1472
01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 2>people off drugs is that I began stuff I</v>
<v Speaker 2>began,</v>

1473
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:37.160
<v Speaker 2>which is from the Boga Tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1474
01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.013
<v Speaker 2>apparently it has a massive impact on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are addicted to heroin and </v>

1475
01:00:41.301 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 2>pills and alcoholics and things along </v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines.</v>

1476
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that stuff just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked it right out of your system.</v>

1477
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

1478
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:52.480
<v Speaker 2>and like really excellent rate of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1479
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.863
<v Speaker 2>people staying off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent percentage of people stay off </v>

1480
01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:58.940
<v Speaker 2>of it permanently as opposed to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other methods.</v>

1481
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.010
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for people to change their </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

1482
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:01.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people get into these little </v>

1483
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>patterns and they get into these habits </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

1484
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:08.660
<v Speaker 2>if one of those habits also is </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically addicting as well,</v>

1485
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>like heroin is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like pills are.</v>

1486
01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just really hard for people to kick</v>

1487
01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:14.810
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying to me,</v>

1488
01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the kind of,</v>

1489
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.990
<v Speaker 2>because I do smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1490
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:21.200
<v Speaker 2>How much do you smoke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1491
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1492
01:01:22.151 --> 01:01:22.984
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the worst it was probably like two </v>

1493
01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:25.040
<v Speaker 2>packs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>

1494
01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.190
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1495
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's probably like half a pack a </v>

1496
01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's better.</v>

1497
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been down though to as low as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four cigarettes a day.</v>

1498
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you just limit yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>

1499
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.183
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the only way I can actually do it </v>

1500
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.183
<v Speaker 2>is to get my girlfriend or my brother or</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody to Dole them out to me cause I </v>

1501
01:01:45.741 --> 01:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>don't have the willpower to just say I </v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't going to do it.</v>

1502
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>What if you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he puts a lot of stress on them</v>

1503
01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 2>to have to regulate it and me fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>bothering them and I'll,</v>

1504
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.843
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking deviously just like sneak </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and go to the gas station had like </v>

1505
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:00.860
<v Speaker 2>another pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm smoking those four,</v>

1506
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:04.650
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also secretly smoking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>another four or five off somewhere else.</v>

1507
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Well that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1508
01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.140
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

1510
01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:09.974
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a problem with that type of </v>

1511
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.640
<v Speaker 2>behavior or accepted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1512
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1513
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I realize when I'm doing it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1514
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a total piece of shit for doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1515
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:23.290
<v Speaker 2>is it just the moment feel so good to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck on that cigarette to feed?</v>

1517
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It's really not because it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

1518
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Every time I smoke a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1519
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:28.420
<v Speaker 2>why am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1520
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.680
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is there's that moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>before or more than a moment,</v>

1521
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lead up to smoking a cigarette.</v>

1522
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

1523
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.420
<v Speaker 2>pet cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I get it,</v>

1524
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:41.320
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1525
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.380
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make me feel just fine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

1526
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I start smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1527
01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:46.320
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking sucks.</v>

1528
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:47.963
<v Speaker 2>And then I put all smoke it or I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke half of it and put it out or </v>

1529
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:51.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1530
01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing I know,</v>

1531
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:55.530
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes to an hour later it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1532
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 2>that next cigarette I smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so fucking nice.</v>

1533
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1534
01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:04.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's the feeling before the cigarette</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

1535
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:09.621
<v Speaker 2>the anticipation and the immediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward is what the immediate reward is.</v>

1536
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disappointment.</v>

1537
01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1538
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:13.590
<v Speaker 2>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1539
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.453
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't really changing my brain </v>

1540
01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 2>chemistry in a significant enough way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks cool though.</v>

1541
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what rebel,</v>

1542
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 2>the visual element is nice.</v>

1543
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I like seeing the smoke just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>climb up and shit.</v>

1544
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That big fucking little stream of smoke </v>

1545
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:32.394
<v Speaker 2>and it curls around and gets bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>does all those fucking little weird </v>

1546
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:36.264
<v Speaker 2>acrobatics and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it does put you into a certain </v>

1547
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:39.414
<v Speaker 2>mindset if you're acknowledging that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing something absolutely </v>

1548
01:03:42.271 --> 01:03:44.430
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This detrimental to your health.</v>

1549
01:03:44.431 --> 01:03:44.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1550
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1551
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.900
<v Speaker 2>there's no debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no division,</v>

1552
01:03:47.901 --> 01:03:49.050
<v Speaker 2>not a terrible it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1553
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck as naive and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck though.</v>

1554
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking stupid.</v>

1555
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1556
01:03:55.771 --> 01:03:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a fucking drone for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of that,</v>

1557
01:03:58.771 --> 01:03:59.604
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want this cigarette in my body right </v>

1558
01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>now more than I want to be healthy </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1560
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.490
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're healthy enough to smoke it.</v>

1561
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Instant gratification.</v>

1562

1563
01:04:12.781 --> 01:04:17.781
<v Speaker 2>yourself to death.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bit of my life force.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're drowning in your own fluid and </v>

<v Speaker 2>they go bad away from us.</v>

1602
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.313
<v Speaker 2>They go bad there in those hospitals </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere locked up in a room and the </v>

1603
01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:50.764
<v Speaker 2>nurses get to see them and they'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you the nurses are the ones once you </v>

1604
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:54.454

1605
01:05:55.631 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 2>is to watch someone die from lung </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

1606

1607
01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:01.864
<v Speaker 2>it to brian red band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile went right in there and </v>

1608

<v Speaker 2>write out there and fell on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1609

1613
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 2>that feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

1614
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.690
<v Speaker 2>it's like a rebellious attitude that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes with it.</v>

1615
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about my health.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I guess in some ways I've tried to </v>

1621
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 2>cultivate that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like George Carlin and shit.</v>

1622
01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I loved that idea of,</v>

1623
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

1624
01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm an observer here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1625
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:46.834
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to look at it from the </v>

1626
01:06:48.581 --> 01:06:51.840
<v Speaker 2>outside and be detached from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've tried to,</v>

1627
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of tried to cultivate that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

1628
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but I've also noticed like it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to,</v>

1629
01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.550
<v Speaker 2>to draw upon my own passions the more I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1630
01:07:00.551 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if I need to find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>happier medium or what.</v>

1631
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>But that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in your analysis of a subject,</v>

1632
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:08.620
<v Speaker 2>like when you're doing these youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

1633
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you almost like an outsider looking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1634
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.333
<v Speaker 2>you feel like there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a good strategy to that </v>

1635
01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe are a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1636
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to make it,</v>

1637
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I guess I try to use it as like a thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bolster objectivity.</v>

1638
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to be just saying what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowd wants to hear,</v>

1639
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.473
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a just saying things </v>

1640
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:34.030
<v Speaker 2>because I think like this is gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most entertaining or whatever.</v>

1641
01:07:34.031 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I want it to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I really fucking think about</v>

1642
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:38.164
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you have to have like some </v>

1643
01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 2>kind of a wall of detachment because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1644
01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:45.460
<v Speaker 2>people aren't always going to react well</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it and shit too.</v>

1645
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good point.</v>

1646
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:52.080
<v Speaker 2>You almost have to be in this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisocial place because you,</v>

1647
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:55.840
<v Speaker 2>if you're too social with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't judge them correctly.</v>

1648
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:57.003
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1649
01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.440
<v Speaker 2>people are very worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1650
01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 2>especially lately about like advertising</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Shit influencing,</v>

1651
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people do and say,</v>

1652
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.350
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't really realize that it's,</v>

1653
01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:11.184
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really just as much of a danger to </v>

1654
01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>become beholden to the audience or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

1655
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>mob and to go along with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

1656
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>here's what we really want to hear from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for sure.</v>

1657
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1658
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:23.143
<v Speaker 1>maybe I might be what you want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I'm gonna fucking </v>

1659
01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Tj,</v>

1660
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>how about you stick to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1661
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To go back to your lane,</v>

1662
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>what's your lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro?</v>

1663
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1664
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you sound like you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced this as well.</v>

1665
01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:37.103
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of people out there in </v>

1666
01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:41.454
<v Speaker 4>this world and if you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions from every single one of them </v>

1667
01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:47.250
<v Speaker 4>and consider them individually without </v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting any of those people,</v>

1668
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.250
<v Speaker 4>to me that's shitty data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1669
01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.200
<v Speaker 4>That's not good data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I know you,</v>

1670
01:08:52.201 --> 01:08:53.034
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you tell me something and you're </v>

1671
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:55.920
<v Speaker 4>smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll consider,</v>

1672
01:08:55.921 --> 01:08:56.754
<v Speaker 4>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1673
01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:57.983
<v Speaker 4>well I know Tj and Tj was saying that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be saying it if he didn't </v>

1674
01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:01.344
<v Speaker 4>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I have to think about what he's </v>

1675
01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:05.160
<v Speaker 4>saying and I'll have to go through my </v>
<v Speaker 4>head and find out whether or not I agree</v>

1676
01:09:05.161 --> 01:09:07.470
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to objectively look at it.</v>

1677
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.530
<v Speaker 4>You could be talking to a million insane</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1678
01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:11.483
<v Speaker 4>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way you could individually </v>

1679
01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:14.754
<v Speaker 4>react to each one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can get a sense of whether or </v>

1680
01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:19.290
<v Speaker 4>not people were upset at you or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1681
01:09:19.291 --> 01:09:20.124
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can get a sense of whether or not </v>

1682
01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:24.990
<v Speaker 4>logical people make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that makes sense.</v>

1683
01:09:24.991 --> 01:09:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Feel like you've crossed a line.</v>

1684
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:26.681
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1685
01:09:26.681 --> 01:09:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed this really weird shift in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zeit geist um,</v>

1686
01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:33.520
<v Speaker 1>in the last like year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1687
01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.980
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of started with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake news thing.</v>

1688
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.713
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left was saying the trump got in </v>

1689
01:09:40.061 --> 01:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>because of fake news and then trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1690
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.883
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll all the attacks against me or </v>

1691
01:09:43.781 --> 01:09:46.120
<v Speaker 1>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1692
01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I've seen on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1693
01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.350
<v Speaker 1>we used to do this kayfabe stuff on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1694
01:09:50.351 --> 01:09:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Kayfabe is like wrestling talk for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:54.370

1696
01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:54.711
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1697
01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:55.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1698
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pageantry of it.</v>

1699
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Like we're just pretending drama and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1700
01:09:58.241 --> 01:09:59.440
<v Speaker 1>We used to do it all the time on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1701
01:09:59.441 --> 01:10:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the drunken peasants podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly people turned on it.</v>

1702
01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:04.330
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want this anymore.</v>

1703
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got shit because I did this,</v>

1705
01:10:07.781 --> 01:10:10.150
<v Speaker 1>a sponsored ad for this app called </v>
<v Speaker 1>candid.</v>

1706
01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:11.883
<v Speaker 1>And people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 1>everything you say is bullshit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did this sponsored spot for candid,</v>

1708
01:10:15.321 --> 01:10:17.740
<v Speaker 1>and you're fucking a shill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we dismiss you.</v>

1709
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:22.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's because everyone's on this big </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking authenticity kick.</v>

1710
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:26.530
<v Speaker 1>But they're not really actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical though.</v>

1711
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.520
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

1712
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:30.640
<v Speaker 1>they just want a demagogue to spew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1713
01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.773
<v Speaker 1>here's what you already think is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am here to validate all of your </v>

1714
01:10:34.661 --> 01:10:35.494
<v Speaker 1>feelings and all of your opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these people seem to want </v>

1715
01:10:38.771 --> 01:10:41.920
<v Speaker 1>me to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not that.</v>

1716
01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:43.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1717
01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.170
<v Speaker 4>they're going to want you to form to </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever their opinion of you is.</v>

1718
01:10:47.171 --> 01:10:48.004
<v Speaker 4>And if you deviate from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a certain amount of </v>

1719
01:10:50.261 --> 01:10:53.440
<v Speaker 4>people that are going to be upset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's up to you to,</v>

1720
01:10:53.441 --> 01:10:56.800
<v Speaker 4>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is the worst thing,</v>

1721
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:57.663
<v Speaker 4>I think for any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any performer or artist is to get boxed </v>

1722
01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.224
<v Speaker 4>into like kind of a fake thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe a character that you do or </v>

1723
01:11:05.411 --> 01:11:07.570
<v Speaker 4>something along those lines and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't get out of it.</v>

1724
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Rick James Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Well like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1726
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:14.110
<v Speaker 4>like Bobcat goldthwait had the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 4>time because he had that I,</v>

1727
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the character that he would do with </v>

1728
01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 4>screaming and yelling bobcat character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1729
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:21.060
<v Speaker 4>And then he wanted to just eventually b </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob Goldthwaite and people like,</v>

1730
01:11:21.061 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that man.</v>

1731
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:23.003
<v Speaker 4>Where's the bobcat thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it took him years to get away from </v>

1732
01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got his films by the way.</v>

1733
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.871
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1734
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:28.704
<v Speaker 4>films are great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the big foot movie know </v>

1735
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Willow Creek?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's haven't seen any horror movie.</v>

1736
01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:33.840
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

1737
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.823
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did it like a Blair witch project </v>

1738
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:40.620
<v Speaker 4>type thing of these people up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sasquatch hunting.</v>

1739
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1740
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:43.840
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say anymore,</v>

1741
01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1742
01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a big skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in a lot of this stuff,</v>

1743
01:11:47.691 --> 01:11:48.524
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really fascinated by things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>big foot and aliens and the lochness </v>

1744
01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.460
<v Speaker 1>monster in the flat earth and the hollow</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth and all this stuff.</v>

1745
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe in any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1746
01:11:57.951 --> 01:12:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I think most of it's like totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous.</v>

1747
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>But I find it really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1748
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.740
<v Speaker 1>because I kind of view it as like almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like modern mythology.</v>

1749
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1750
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you kind of see the genesis of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk.</v>

1751
01:12:10.311 --> 01:12:11.144
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people used to talk about like suck </v>

1752
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:14.720
<v Speaker 1>buses coming in in the night and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1753
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:15.763
<v Speaker 1>stealing their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their essence and shit and seducing </v>

1754
01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:18.824
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1755
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of see like the modern </v>

1756
01:12:20.961 --> 01:12:21.794
<v Speaker 1>versions of that is like the alien that </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes you up and it was ship and shoves </v>

1757
01:12:24.051 --> 01:12:26.690
<v Speaker 1>a probe up your ass or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.460
<v Speaker 4>Well I think alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the alien thing absolutely has something</v>

1759
01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:31.294
<v Speaker 4>to do with dreaming 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a giant percentage of these </v>

1760
01:12:35.111 --> 01:12:35.944
<v Speaker 4>abduction events occur when someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>either napping or when someone's </v>

1761
01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:40.780
<v Speaker 4>sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1762
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:43.630
<v Speaker 4>they're always unconscious sleep </v>
<v Speaker 4>paralysis.</v>

1763
01:12:43.631 --> 01:12:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1764
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not even just that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1765
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:50.560
<v Speaker 4>it's probably psychedelic compound </v>
<v Speaker 4>compounds that are released in the brain</v>

1766
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:51.423
<v Speaker 4>during rem sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why you have these wacky </v>

1767
01:12:52.991 --> 01:12:54.280
<v Speaker 4>fucking dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1768
01:12:54.281 --> 01:12:57.670
<v Speaker 4>you have dreams that are so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like a psychedelic trip.</v>

1769
01:12:57.690 --> 01:12:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like an imagination.</v>

1770
01:12:59.361 --> 01:13:01.480
<v Speaker 4>It has control of the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals,</v>

1771
01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:03.490
<v Speaker 4>a power your brain and runs you on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>

1772
01:13:03.491 --> 01:13:04.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where are,</v>

1773
01:13:04.301 --> 01:13:04.450
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1774
01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:06.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1775
01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:07.084
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really suffer from it too bad </v>

1776
01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like in,</v>

1777
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:14.020
<v Speaker 1>in my late teens and early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had really bad sleep paralysis.</v>

1778
01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1779
01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:16.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

1780
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a company that was a,</v>

1781
01:13:17.321 --> 01:13:18.154
<v Speaker 1>I forget if it's called hypnopompic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations or hypnagogic </v>

1782
01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:22.300
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1783
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you right,</v>

1784
01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1785
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be laying in bed or I would be at </v>

1786
01:13:28.961 --> 01:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the time and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1787
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of wake up but I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to move my body.</v>

1788
01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:36.671
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1789
01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aside from that,</v>

1790
01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:39.843
<v Speaker 1>you feel the overwhelming sense of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another presence here and it's </v>

1791
01:13:46.391 --> 01:13:49.030
<v Speaker 1>ominous and you fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1792
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:50.203
<v Speaker 1>if you have the hypnagogic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations or hypnopompic </v>

1793
01:13:51.971 --> 01:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations that there one is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1794
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you hallucinate as you're going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

1795
01:13:55.481 --> 01:13:56.980
<v Speaker 1>One is when you loosening as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out,</v>

1796
01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I have the one where you hallucinate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of sleep.</v>

1797
01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.023
<v Speaker 1>So I would wake up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the first time it happened I </v>

1798
01:14:04.631 --> 01:14:09.631
<v Speaker 1>was 11 and I saw this robe to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>like walk across my bedroom.</v>

1799
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.820
<v Speaker 1>And then when I was 15,</v>

1800
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 2>what did it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A real thing.</v>

1801
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it looked totally real.</v>

1802
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.330
<v Speaker 2>It didn't look like it was transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1803
01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1804
01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:21.470
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just like,</v>

1805
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.000
<v Speaker 2>it didn't look like a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there was like four feet tall.</v>

1806
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gnome.</v>

1807
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1808
01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I assumed it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my uncle is a big Ufo guy,</v>

1809
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:31.654
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw an alien and at the time I was </v>

1810
01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 2>convinced to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Later I became more skeptical and when I</v>

1811
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:42.241
<v Speaker 2>was like 15 I woke up and I saw this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking a figure standing at the foot of</v>

1812
01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen the movie dark city?</v>

1813
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.253
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did that sleep thing from dark city </v>

1814
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1815
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 2>And I went back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1816
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I woke up the next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1817
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that happens again,</v>

1818
01:14:56.981 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking tackle this thing.</v>

1819
01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.730
<v Speaker 2>You sure that wasn't just a dream?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1820
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I was awake because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall,</v>

1821
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Speaker 2>the fall of two weeks later I saw it </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and I did like,</v>

1822
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.044
<v Speaker 2>I plan to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking jumped up and I tried to </v>

1823
01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:10.264
<v Speaker 2>tackle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just kind of disappeared in my arms </v>

1824
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 2>when I got to it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1825
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:17.140
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was okay.</v>

1826
01:15:17.141 --> 01:15:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1827
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:18.303
<v Speaker 2>I was relieved because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was obviously a hallucination and I </v>

1828
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:20.704
<v Speaker 2>look up and it's fucking head is </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating there and it just done this </v>

1829
01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 2>head vanishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1830
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these are just hallucinations.</v>

1831
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:29.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if they're not houses hard </v>

1832
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>interdimensional beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know cause uh,</v>

1833
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 2>sound so confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read pretty extensively about it.</v>

1834
01:15:38.441 --> 01:15:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Cause like when that shit happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1835
01:15:39.731 --> 01:15:41.830
<v Speaker 2>you want to know like what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1836
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:46.690
<v Speaker 2>So when they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can induce that state and uh,</v>

1837
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:47.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they can put you into sleep </v>

1838
01:15:48.971 --> 01:15:49.804
<v Speaker 2>paralysis and you'll feel the presence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll experience seeing things and </v>

1839
01:15:52.511 --> 01:15:53.020
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

1840
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:53.853
<v Speaker 2>They can put you in that mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of electrically </v>

1841
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:58.030
<v Speaker 2>stimulating certain areas of the scalp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1842
01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is really fascinating,</v>

1843
01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:00.394
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they can actually target areas of </v>

1844
01:16:01.811 --> 01:16:05.530
<v Speaker 2>the scalp and induce certain feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and certain thoughts.</v>

1845
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of delved into this last time we</v>

1846
01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:08.764
<v Speaker 2>talked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness and the afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things of that nature.</v>

1848
01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I wonder though,</v>

1881
01:17:35.481 --> 01:17:36.314
<v Speaker 2>my head for years and I started thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about demons and the idea of being </v>

1882
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:41.680
<v Speaker 2>possessed and what could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:54.050

<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

1888
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.970
<v Speaker 2>The extra assist is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1889
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.813
<v Speaker 2>it's funny by today's standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like if you go watch it in the </v>

1890
01:17:58.131 --> 01:17:58.964
<v Speaker 2>context of like watch horror movies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came around around the same time and </v>

1891
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:03.230
<v Speaker 2>before it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

1906
01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:36.793
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually in a movie that they said that </v>

1907
01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:39.801
<v Speaker 2>in a movie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>getting away with that fucking now given</v>

1909
01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:45.350
<v Speaker 2>the age of the actress.</v>

1910
01:18:45.351 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be illegal now.</v>

1911
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be illegal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1915
01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 2>it would probably be controversial even </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was made.</v>

1916
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Just making that little kid act like </v>

1918
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:03.830

<v Speaker 2>flopping up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were doing that with wires and that</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

1930
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Total disregard for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for her safety or wellbeing.</v>

1931
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Fucked her backup for life when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little kid making his movie.</v>

1932
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you know specifically?</v>

1934
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just gave her back back issues.</v>

1935
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they were severe or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1936
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:37.724
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something got polled or something got </v>

1937
01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 2>out of alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you saw how violently they had flopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and down on that bed.</v>

1939

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

1940

1942
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1943
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>get an effect.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the most like it's tiny little thing.</v>

1953

<v Speaker 4>fucking baby.</v>

01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:25.224
<v Speaker 4>You can't even talk yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're already on tv but the whole </v>

1961
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.960

<v Speaker 4>Does this seem ethical?</v>

1962
01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:42.240
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really seem ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not ethical.</v>

1963

<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why when people are like make fun</v>

1964
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:50.940
<v Speaker 4>of that a American sniper movie for </v>
<v Speaker 4>using that little shitty plastic baby.</v>

1965
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:52.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh it was obviously fake.</v>

1966
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.063
<v Speaker 4>I'm like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better than fucking having some </v>

1967
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:58.890
<v Speaker 4>real kid and getting it to cry and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>and whatever.</v>

1968
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.040
<v Speaker 4>I blame clinics went on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you should have phrased that better</v>

1969
01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 4>to frame away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have sold it better.</v>

1970
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could.</v>

1971
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.200
<v Speaker 4>You could have filmed that in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different way.</v>

1972
01:21:07.201 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 4>He films things a lot of times in a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of traditional way.</v>

1973
01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:11.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a great director and everything </v>

1974
01:21:12.121 --> 01:21:12.954
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how the hell did he not see that </v>

1975
01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:16.160
<v Speaker 4>rubber baby?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll look so funny.</v>

1976
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1977
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 4>give him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give him a little,</v>

1978
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:20.123
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somebody there with them in the </v>

1979
01:21:21.451 --> 01:21:22.500
<v Speaker 4>editing room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going home,</v>

1980
01:21:22.501 --> 01:21:24.840
<v Speaker 4>street swept off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rubber baby.</v>

1981
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:25.770
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to,</v>

1982
01:21:25.771 --> 01:21:27.930
<v Speaker 4>who's going to tell dirty harry that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>scene doesn't work?</v>

1983
01:21:27.931 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 4>Did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1984
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when,</v>

1985
01:21:31.741 --> 01:21:33.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole movie was,</v>

1986
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.480
<v Speaker 4>that was a weird time when that movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out.</v>

1987
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.490
<v Speaker 4>That was like a movie where you had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say you liked it.</v>

1988
01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't say you liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you risk violence.</v>

1989
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't see it,</v>

1990
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:45.900
<v Speaker 4>so I seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it since then,</v>

1991
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 4>but at the time I didn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just wasn't a very good movie.</v>

1992
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 4>Now a lot of people love the movie and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them it was really good.</v>

1993
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:54.780
<v Speaker 4>To me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1994
01:21:54.781 --> 01:21:58.860
<v Speaker 4>it was like so much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is probably my personal bias of</v>

1995
01:21:58.861 --> 01:21:59.694
<v Speaker 4>like being out here and being in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood and knowing how writers work </v>

1996
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:04.360
<v Speaker 4>and knowing how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1997
01:22:04.361 --> 01:22:05.194
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they structure these things and how </v>

1998
01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:07.794
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of effect the studio wants to </v>

1999
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.950
<v Speaker 4>have on the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For big mainstream movie,</v>

2000
01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:16.130
<v Speaker 4>you could feel like the heavy hand of of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood all over it and you could feel</v>

2001
01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:20.100
<v Speaker 4>like the way they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wording,</v>

2002
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:24.090
<v Speaker 4>the things that he said and the just all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing was like so affected.</v>

2003
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:25.103
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting a good sense of what </v>

2004
01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:28.830
<v Speaker 4>this guy's real life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was propaganda.</v>

2005
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:31.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

2006
01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:31.914
<v Speaker 4>and then you find out about the Jesse </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ventura thing where Jesse Ventura sued </v>

2007
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:38.760
<v Speaker 4>him because he made up some story and </v>
<v Speaker 4>them up.</v>

2008
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:39.603
<v Speaker 4>And apparently there was a few other </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories that weren't true as well that </v>

2009
01:22:42.631 --> 01:22:46.680
<v Speaker 4>were in that book that fucked a Jesse </v>
<v Speaker 4>venture is a career up a little bit too.</v>

2010
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just don,</v>

2011
01:22:48.241 --> 01:22:49.074
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It cost him over a million dollars in </v>

2012
01:22:51.061 --> 01:22:51.980
<v Speaker 4>legal fees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2013
01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:54.100
<v Speaker 4>And he's been doing it for what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years now.</v>

2014
01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:56.280
<v Speaker 4>Got a judgment in his favor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they,</v>

2015
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.730
<v Speaker 4>they did shift lead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took it away somehow.</v>

2016
01:22:59.731 --> 01:23:01.440
<v Speaker 4>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lost on appeal.</v>

2017
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.910
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is not good because hey,</v>

2018
01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 4>he's a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

2019
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

2020
01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.200
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2021
01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.093
<v Speaker 4>the truth is truth and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just make stuff up about </v>

2022
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:13.354
<v Speaker 4>people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he should've dropped the lawsuit </v>

2023
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:17.560
<v Speaker 4>when the guy died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2024
01:23:17.561 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 4>maybe that would have been better for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

2025
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.630
<v Speaker 4>but that this his decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he felt like he was wrong.</v>

2026
01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Then he felt like he was going after the</v>
<v Speaker 4>publishers.</v>

2027
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:27.100
<v Speaker 4>When the legend becomes truth print the </v>
<v Speaker 4>legend.</v>

2028
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2029
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.153
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think also you're dealing with the </v>

2030
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:34.114
<v Speaker 4>pressures of war being so alien to most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that when you and I who have not </v>

2031
01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 4>been to war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit,</v>

2032
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.333
<v Speaker 4>sit around talking and debating about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's like to be like the most </v>

2033
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:45.874
<v Speaker 4>decorated sniper ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or a guy who experiences that much </v>

2034
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:49.744
<v Speaker 4>action and sees that much death and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>really try to rationalize what goes in </v>

2035
01:23:53.201 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 4>and out of their mind and like what </v>
<v Speaker 4>their grasp on reality is like.</v>

2036
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:59.680
<v Speaker 4>And then there's also the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this guy has.</v>

2037
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.260
<v Speaker 4>If you're leaving the military and </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing a book,</v>

2038
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:03.363
<v Speaker 4>why not just make a bunch of crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and make it even better to sell more </v>

2039
01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:08.080
<v Speaker 4>fucking books?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2040
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's very possible that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>would take that attitude like,</v>

2041
01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:13.234
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to tell you most of the </v>

2042
01:24:14.021 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 4>truth anyway cause it's not in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>

2043
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:17.074
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it might be classified and some </v>

2044
01:24:18.851 --> 01:24:21.640
<v Speaker 4>of them might be illegal for me to talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

2045
01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I'll make up a bunch of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2046
01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:24.813
<v Speaker 4>sell some bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm on the selling me stage of my </v>

2047
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:28.020
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2048
01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2049
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.373
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was probably always doing that to </v>

2050
01:24:30.901 --> 01:24:31.800
<v Speaker 2>some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2051
01:24:31.801 --> 01:24:32.840
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2052
01:24:32.841 --> 01:24:33.674
<v Speaker 2>you don't become the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top American sniper unless you </v>

2053
01:24:36.361 --> 01:24:38.790
<v Speaker 2>already have a preconceived notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as like,</v>

2054
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm this bad ass and I'm this great </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>

2055
01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And anything you can say to add to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

2056
01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:44.580
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2057
01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could just be a badass sniper,</v>

2058
01:24:47.371 --> 01:24:48.204
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just be just some dude who just </v>

2059
01:24:49.201 --> 01:24:50.620
<v Speaker 2>excels?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2060
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you look at his character in this,</v>

2061
01:24:52.291 --> 01:24:54.210
<v Speaker 2>the sort of stories these made up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2062
01:24:54.211 --> 01:24:55.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's obvious that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2063
01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:56.483
<v Speaker 2>while he did have actual skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was also fond of embellishing the </v>

2064
01:24:59.581 --> 01:25:02.790
<v Speaker 2>skills he did have to make himself even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more legendary.</v>

2065
01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is the question,</v>

2066
01:25:04.801 --> 01:25:07.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are people that think that</v>

2067
01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.990
<v Speaker 2>the horrors of war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we talked about,</v>

2068
01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.140
<v Speaker 2>bend the mind and Ben Perception and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben,</v>

2069
01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:13.974
<v Speaker 2>the way you look at reality and in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people more severe ways and other </v>

2070
01:25:16.651 --> 01:25:17.484
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2071
01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:19.043
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2072
01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:19.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the I,</v>

2073
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:22.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the request or the,</v>

2074
01:25:22.381 --> 01:25:23.214
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2075
01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.173
<v Speaker 2>the task that we give young people where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go off to war at fucking 18 years </v>

2076
01:25:29.401 --> 01:25:30.990
<v Speaker 2>of age and we ship</v>

2077
01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:31.853
<v Speaker 4>them off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get them to shoot people and then </v>

2078
01:25:33.331 --> 01:25:37.410
<v Speaker 4>comeback and integrate and try to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal part of society.</v>

2079
01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:41.430
<v Speaker 4>And then with almost no education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost no assistance,</v>

2080
01:25:41.431 --> 01:25:42.270
<v Speaker 4>no help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2081
01:25:42.271 --> 01:25:43.440
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Karen them along.</v>

2082
01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:44.480
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2083
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:47.520
<v Speaker 4>you mean she'd be looking at them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to him very carefully.</v>

2084
01:25:47.521 --> 01:25:48.354
<v Speaker 4>You've asked him to do</v>

2085
01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.410
<v Speaker 2>crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:25:49.411 --> 01:25:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the,</v>

2087
01:25:50.281 --> 01:25:50.591
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2088
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:51.424
<v Speaker 2>like 18 is around the time when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just willing to dump like pancakes on </v>

2089
01:25:56.221 --> 01:25:58.440
<v Speaker 2>some dude's lap because he fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2090
01:25:58.530 --> 01:25:59.363
<v Speaker 2>set across thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to take people at that age and who </v>

2091
01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:04.910
<v Speaker 2>haven't even really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2092
01:26:04.911 --> 01:26:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess they've kind of reached the age </v>
<v Speaker 2>of reason and stuff,</v>

2093
01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eyes of society,</v>

2094
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2095
01:26:11.081 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 2>they're not like fully formed adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds yet.</v>

2096
01:26:14.031 --> 01:26:14.864
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2097
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:15.973
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much still a kid in a lot </v>

2098
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 2>of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go overseas and kill some other people's</v>

2099
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 2>fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see what happens.</v>

2100
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:23.773
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try over there and blow some </v>

2101
01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:25.011
<v Speaker 2>brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2102
01:26:25.011 --> 01:26:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you blew out more brains than anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2103
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:28.370
<v Speaker 2>You're a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're great.</v>

2104
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:33.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2105
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2106
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:36.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're asking someone to do </v>

2107
01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:41.180
<v Speaker 2>something before there a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're,</v>

2108
01:26:41.181 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 2>you have a certain amount of authority </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a 17 year old or an 18 year old.</v>

2109
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 2>When you give them a gun and tell them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're supposed to do it,</v>

2110
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:48.283
<v Speaker 2>they believe they're supposed to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're older and you tell them </v>

2111
01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:50.664
<v Speaker 2>that they're supposed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So reason why 40 year old guys don't </v>

2112
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 2>sign up for the army because when a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's 40 might have a family of his own,</v>

2113
01:26:58.611 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 2>might have a life of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they're like,</v>

2114
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:00.260
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2115
01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck are we going over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are these guys done to us?</v>

2116
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

2117
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 2>When are we charging a dawn with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan?</v>

2118
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.903
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to ask questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've going to just trust you at face </v>

2119
01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:10.730
<v Speaker 2>value and that's no good.</v>

2120
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:12.230
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you want,</v>

2121
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 2>when you want soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want someone who just listens.</v>

2122
01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are you listening to though?</v>

2123
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Like who were you listening to and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you listen to that guy and what,</v>

2124
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:22.140
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get into this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2125
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 2>they don't think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking 18.</v>

2126
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.620
<v Speaker 2>It's just asking people to go from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to regular life.</v>

2127
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:29.780
<v Speaker 2>It's such a bizarre request.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2128
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 2>My stepdad tried to get me to join the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2129
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:33.650
<v Speaker 2>the military when I was younger cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2130
01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 2>he saw me and like your life has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

2131
01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need military.</v>

2132
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I thought about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really give it much thought.</v>

2133
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I went to the recruiting office and let </v>
<v Speaker 2>them give me a sales pitch.</v>

2134
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.640
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you went that far.</v>

2135
01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I never went into her acuity recruiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

2136
01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Thank God I took a test and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2137
01:27:51.831 --> 01:27:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you could be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2138
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.440
<v Speaker 2>military intelligence.</v>

2139
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

2140
01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.850
<v Speaker 2>but I heard that a lot of times they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucker you in with that.</v>

2141
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to be military </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

2142
01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Then if you don't cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2143
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.211
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't cut it.</v>

2144
01:28:02.211 --> 01:28:03.560
<v Speaker 2>You're a grunt now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that recruiters will bullshit</v>

2146
01:28:06.141 --> 01:28:06.974
<v Speaker 2>you and tell you they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you some cool job inside the military </v>

2147
01:28:09.891 --> 01:28:12.260
<v Speaker 2>and then once you get in there they give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or fuck the job.</v>

2148
01:28:12.261 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 2>They were thinking about giving you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place,</v>

2149
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:15.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2150
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

2151
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:18.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a college where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2152
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.413
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to choose your major and all </v>

2153
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:21.590
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that.</v>

2154
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:22.723
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2155
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:27.140
<v Speaker 2>they'll decide in many ways it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of communist in a way,</v>

2156
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get paid very little.</v>

2157
01:28:29.121 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 2>He worked very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is for company.</v>

2158
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2159
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:32.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really kind of weird.</v>

2160
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well America has a a strange </v>

2161
01:28:35.271 --> 01:28:36.104
<v Speaker 2>relationship with that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>collectivism when you think about it </v>

2162
01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:38.954
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it has to probably be that way in </v>

2163
01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:43.160
<v Speaker 2>order for you to function together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A soldier's.</v>

2164
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:44.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2165
01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:45.194
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you really want a unit </v>

2166
01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:49.860
<v Speaker 2>where everyone's constantly questioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>orders and you know,</v>

2167
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2168
01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:51.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as we kind of placed value on </v>

2169
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:53.751
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2170
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to think for yourself and it's</v>

2171
01:28:55.341 --> 01:28:57.870
<v Speaker 2>good to question things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2172
01:28:58.070 --> 01:29:00.230
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to be an effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

2173
01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:00.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2174
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.793
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's good is you do what your fucking </v>

2175
01:29:03.241 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2176
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably why they use 18 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>olds to begin with.</v>

2177
01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:08.920
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2178
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>even if we're going to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that that's how it has to be,</v>

2179
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:15.780
<v Speaker 2>there has to be more oversight about </v>
<v Speaker 2>where are we going to send these people?</v>

2180
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:18.930
<v Speaker 2>What reasons have to be in place for us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to send these people.</v>

2181
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.270
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2182
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 2>we're still at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that we're still in Iraq,</v>

2183
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>we're still in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama during his presidency,</v>

2184
01:29:25.081 --> 01:29:28.560
<v Speaker 2>bombed a seven countries with drone </v>
<v Speaker 2>strikes.</v>

2185
01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.401
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2186
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:30.234
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever seen the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the report that like 90% of drone </v>

2187
01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 2>strikes didn't kill their intended </v>
<v Speaker 2>targets,</v>

2188
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:37.410
<v Speaker 2>90% civilian casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2190
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:39.180
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2191
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.373
<v Speaker 2>terribly ineffectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why our country is like spreading </v>

2192
01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:46.920
<v Speaker 2>bad will across the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the Middle East,</v>

2193
01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:49.740
<v Speaker 2>which is like a hotbed of fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucks anyway.</v>

2194
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Just doing it that way in general robots</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying from the sky.</v>

2195
01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:55.063
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>

2196
01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.710
<v Speaker 2>you gotta make sure those things work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're going to just,</v>

2197
01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't be that off where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing.</v>

2198
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the high 80%,</v>

2199
01:30:04.411 --> 01:30:06.930
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it last time we checked with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2200
01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:08.243
<v Speaker 2>the civilian casualty rate was </v>
<v Speaker 2>unintended casualties for drone strikes </v>

2201
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:13.523
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have any weapon that has </v>

2202
01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:17.550
<v Speaker 2>like 10% effectiveness at killing its </v>
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>

2203
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:19.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's not a good weapon.</v>

2204
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just w but we're like,</v>

2205
01:30:22.141 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2206
01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.453
<v Speaker 2>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way we don't have to send soldiers </v>

2207
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:26.243
<v Speaker 2>and we just fly it in and we just shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>the missiles and we get the fuck out of </v>

2208
01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:29.070
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2209
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:31.740
<v Speaker 2>that's really what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see the appeal of that,</v>

2210
01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:32.574
<v Speaker 2>but make sure the technology is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a way it might be like the most </v>

2211
01:30:37.471 --> 01:30:39.810
<v Speaker 2>racist way to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2212
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.140
<v Speaker 2>We're not even willing a whisk at risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>our own lives to kill you.</v>

2213
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:44.123
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to kill you from afar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were not as concerned about </v>

2214
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 2>killing civilians because no one's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it cause we're all the way</v>

2215
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 2>in Nevada with a fucking xbox </v>
<v Speaker 2>controller.</v>

2216
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone were killing is just some,</v>

2217
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:56.280
<v Speaker 2>some brown Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's okay.</v>

2218
01:30:56.370 --> 01:30:57.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nearly 90% of the people killed in </v>

2219
01:30:58.621 --> 01:31:00.600
<v Speaker 2>airstrikes were not the intended </v>
<v Speaker 2>targets,</v>

2220
01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2221
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:02.790
<v Speaker 2>And some of these still might have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad people.</v>

2222
01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:04.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're hanging around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

2223
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they might have Eris and shit.</v>

2224
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we saw in the Yemen raid a,</v>

2225
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.113
<v Speaker 2>the plenty of those victims were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there footage of a drone like </v>

2226
01:31:15.991 --> 01:31:19.260
<v Speaker 2>watching a drone shoot down something is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2228
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Is it from the drones point of view or </v>

<v Speaker 2>usually,</v>

2230
01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.310
<v Speaker 2>usually you'll see it from the drone </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

2231
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a drone launch.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Something like if you were on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>

2255
01:32:25.761 --> 01:32:28.490
<v Speaker 2>these people down the street and they </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

2261
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.950

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2262
01:32:39.951 --> 01:32:42.110
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't have released that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't know.</v>

2263
01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:43.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't know when our tax dollars </v>

2264
01:32:44.511 --> 01:32:45.180
<v Speaker 2>fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2265
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:46.013
<v Speaker 2>the murder of civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accidental unintended murder of a </v>

2266
01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:52.800
<v Speaker 2>guy with a camera that you thought was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun yet.</v>

2267
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.780
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2268
01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.613
<v Speaker 2>when you see this statistic that 90% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these strikes are killing the wrong </v>

2269
01:32:56.781 --> 01:32:58.100
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2270
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

2271
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:03.980
<v Speaker 2>it's happening all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it crazy how shit their optics</v>

2272
01:33:03.981 --> 01:33:04.814
<v Speaker 2>are that they can't tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between a rifle and a camera at </v>

2273
01:33:08.241 --> 01:33:08.760
<v Speaker 2>distance?</v>

2274
01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:09.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even just the optics to is </v>

2275
01:33:10.611 --> 01:33:13.070
<v Speaker 2>just bits is bad intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll,</v>

2276
01:33:13.071 --> 01:33:15.020
<v Speaker 2>they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have to actually risk</v>

2277
01:33:15.021 --> 01:33:16.370
<v Speaker 2>any troops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>They'll just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone says like,</v>

2279
01:33:17.691 --> 01:33:18.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's at this house.</v>

2280
01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2281
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.971
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

2282
01:33:19.971 --> 01:33:20.870
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2283
01:33:20.871 --> 01:33:21.501
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2284
01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:23.960
<v Speaker 2>If they were on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't treat it that way.</v>

2285
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:26.690
<v Speaker 2>If they were on the ground and we saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the ground,</v>

2286
01:33:26.691 --> 01:33:29.090
<v Speaker 2>they were walking down the street and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw the photographer with the,</v>

2287
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:30.223
<v Speaker 2>with the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably wouldn't treat it and it </v>

2288
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.511
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

2289
01:33:32.511 --> 01:33:33.344
<v Speaker 2>They would just open fire and gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody down as soon as they saw the </v>

2290
01:33:35.211 --> 01:33:36.044
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2291
01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:36.913
<v Speaker 2>So you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just gone everybody down that you </v>

2292
01:33:38.041 --> 01:33:41.570
<v Speaker 2>run into on your way to the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bad guys.</v>

2293
01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.471
<v Speaker 2>But when it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's,</v>

2294
01:33:42.471 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 2>when you have that level of detachment </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

2295
01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a fucking video game.</v>

2296
01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Oops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed some,</v>

2297
01:33:46.611 --> 01:33:47.930

<v Speaker 2>I killed some civilians.</v>

2298
01:33:47.931 --> 01:33:48.764
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the ducks and points from the </v>

2299
01:33:49.401 --> 01:33:50.090
<v Speaker 2>scoreboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2300
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:53.120
<v Speaker 2>because if you were on the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing happened,</v>

2301
01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:53.983
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you be judged differently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you are on the ground and you </v>

2302
01:33:56.001 --> 01:33:56.834
<v Speaker 2>are moving down the street and you saw a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people in front of you and one </v>

2303
01:33:58.551 --> 01:34:01.850
<v Speaker 2>guy had a camera and you just gun them </v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2307
01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:06.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2308
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't have been out here with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids.</v>

2309
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:09.560
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that was the camera.</v>

2310
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's essentially,</v>

2311
01:34:10.670 --> 01:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>is that exactly what the guy said from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the helicopter,</v>

2312
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:13.603
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2313
01:34:13.670 --> 01:34:14.503
<v Speaker 2>but it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because there's a level of </v>

2314
01:34:16.581 --> 01:34:18.680
<v Speaker 2>detachment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that wall of separation,</v>

2315
01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.810
<v Speaker 2>that wall of separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fucked.</v>

2316
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

2317
01:34:22.130 --> 01:34:24.620
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90%.</v>

2318
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:25.723
<v Speaker 2>90.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just keep doing it that way </v>

2319
01:34:29.391 --> 01:34:30.224
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

2320
01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.480
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing we can do about it.</v>

2321
01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:33.731
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>

2322
01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:34.341
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm,</v>

2323
01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:35.400
<v Speaker 2>when I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about that,</v>

2324
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:36.303
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about the collusion between </v>

2325
01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:38.624
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats and the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the kind of shit I'm talking </v>

2326
01:34:39.801 --> 01:34:41.840
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't stop military stuff.</v>

2327
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2328
01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:44.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff doesn't seem to stop.</v>

2329
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's D or R,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2330
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:48.163
<v Speaker 2>This military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this American Empire that we're trying </v>

2331
01:34:50.961 --> 01:34:53.450
<v Speaker 2>to maintain across the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that keeps happening.</v>

2332
01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.750
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a very good point </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that stays consistent.</v>

2333
01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:57.613
<v Speaker 2>And the battle over transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathrooms take front page of the news </v>

2334
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:01.483
<v Speaker 2>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the war aspect of it stays </v>

2335
01:35:03.351 --> 01:35:05.870
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drone aspects days consistent.</v>

2336
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't ramp up and it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ramping up a little bit with trump.</v>

2337
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2338
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that remains to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2339
01:35:13.671 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2340
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Obama's been pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama Obama was pretty bad about it.</v>

2341
01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was extremely violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2342
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:19.753
<v Speaker 2>drone strikes increased under him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's some of that's just because </v>

2343
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:22.820
<v Speaker 2>the technology improved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2344
01:35:22.821 --> 01:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things about him that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so confusing.</v>

2345
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.850
<v Speaker 2>The drone strikes is just one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about the attacks on whistleblowers?</v>

2346
01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:29.813
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever happened and what you said</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your shit like yet that hope and </v>

2347
01:35:33.051 --> 01:35:33.884
<v Speaker 2>change website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole thing was going to give </v>

2348
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.250
<v Speaker 2>an offer protection to whistle blowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2349
01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you have like one of the biggest whistle</v>
<v Speaker 2>blowers in the history of the world.</v>

2350
01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Yet the idea of transparency to that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a big thing.</v>

2351
01:35:43.881 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 2>He transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency,</v>

2352
01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:46.334
<v Speaker 2>but then you prosecute whistleblowers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who revealed the gay illegal activities </v>

2353
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 2>of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when trump was like,</v>

2354
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.480
<v Speaker 2>he wiretapped trump tower.</v>

2355
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what he wiretapped America,</v>

2356
01:35:56.270 --> 01:36:01.270
<v Speaker 2>the NSA was instill is like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering everyone's text messages.</v>

2357
01:36:01.971 --> 01:36:02.804
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's phone calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>archiving that shit in a big server </v>

2358
01:36:05.421 --> 01:36:07.060
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it hasn't,</v>

2359
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 2>how's he walked that back though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't he said now that he doesn't think</v>

2360
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:12.800
<v Speaker 2>that it was a wire tap that it was mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

2361
01:36:12.801 --> 01:36:13.634
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2362
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.533
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the phones are fucking tapped </v>

2363
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does it matter?</v>

2364
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That information is already there.</v>

2365
01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:21.561
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2366
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 2>the crazy thing is that not only is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for those agencies,</v>

2367
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:28.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's there for anyone who can hack </v>
<v Speaker 2>into those agencies to get,</v>

2368
01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:33.740
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the cio at the,</v>

2369
01:36:33.741 --> 01:36:34.221
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2370
01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:35.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NSA developed it,</v>

2371
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.220
<v Speaker 2>the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now know,</v>

2372
01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:40.370
<v Speaker 2>has its own version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many private companies have</v>

2373
01:36:40.371 --> 01:36:42.590
<v Speaker 2>their own version of this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>server.</v>

2374
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we found out that the CIA has their</v>

2375
01:36:44.481 --> 01:36:45.620
<v Speaker 2>own version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was like,</v>

2376
01:36:45.621 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what them to done,</v>

2377
01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:49.820
<v Speaker 2>todd?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2378
01:36:49.821 --> 01:36:52.580
<v Speaker 2>they're even worse than the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how would you know?</v>

2379
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:53.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2380
01:36:53.701 --> 01:36:54.534
<v Speaker 2>I guess I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I can't say with certainty </v>

2381
01:36:56.631 --> 01:36:57.464
<v Speaker 2>they're worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the NSA has never been involved as </v>

2382
01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:01.094
<v Speaker 2>far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in toppling the democratically elected </v>

2383
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:05.533
<v Speaker 2>leaders of other countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>installing puppets that are good for </v>

2384
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:11.150
<v Speaker 2>American business interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the CIA has,</v>

2385
01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.370
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Numerous times.</v>

2386
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2387
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:18.430
<v Speaker 2>the idea of them all being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to anybody's telephone calls were</v>

2388
01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.540
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist,</v>

2389
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:22.700
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>felon,</v>

2390
01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not he was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicest person of all time,</v>

2391
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:26.240
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

2392
01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.320
<v Speaker 2>let me just check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2393
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 2>You're still the nicest guy of all time.</v>

2394
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.400
<v Speaker 2>And they're using it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2395
01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just being used for terrorism.</v>

2396
01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:32.451
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using it for,</v>

2397
01:37:32.451 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 2>there's through their drug war as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2399
01:37:35.661 --> 01:37:36.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2400
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.183
<v Speaker 2>the drug war is going to have to ramp up</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this marijuana legalization keeps </v>

2401
01:37:39.531 --> 01:37:41.240
<v Speaker 2>kicking in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to figure out some</v>

2402
01:37:41.241 --> 01:37:44.270
<v Speaker 2>other way to arrest people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to keep the same jobs.</v>

2403
01:37:44.271 --> 01:37:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of jobs.</v>

2404
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.700
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to justify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2405
01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:51.701
<v Speaker 2>jeff sessions could come to the pot </v>
<v Speaker 2>shops like where I live and uh,</v>

2406
01:37:52.821 --> 01:37:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's pot shops around here </v>
<v Speaker 2>too and uh,</v>

2407
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 2>and they could fucking</v>

2408
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 4>read them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could shut them down.</v>

2409
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could legally,</v>

2410
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the,</v>

2411
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:02.490
<v Speaker 4>because it's still illegal under federal</v>
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>

2412
01:38:02.491 --> 01:38:03.324
<v Speaker 4>Obama chose not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He chose her respect the will of the </v>

2413
01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:05.784
<v Speaker 4>states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the trump administration has at </v>

2414
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 4>least signaling that it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of sessions.</v>

2415
01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:12.293
<v Speaker 4>You think because of a point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's just because of </v>

2416
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:14.214
<v Speaker 4>sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think sessions is where he is </v>

2417
01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 4>partially because they want to do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>crackdown.</v>

2418
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

2419
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 4>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll have to find out about that,</v>

2420
01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.420
<v Speaker 4>but the crackdown is not going to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2421
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You let the genie out of the bottle,</v>

2422
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.100
<v Speaker 4>you gave people their freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be the,</v>

2423
01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:30.023
<v Speaker 4>that'll be the death of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the power of the trump </v>

2424
01:38:32.461 --> 01:38:33.294
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they actually go through with </v>

2425
01:38:34.201 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 4>something so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be stupid economically as well.</v>

2426
01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would show.</v>

2427
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk about transparency,</v>

2428
01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:41.593
<v Speaker 4>it will show really clearly who your </v>
<v Speaker 4>loyalty is to that it's not to the will </v>

2429
01:38:45.781 --> 01:38:46.614
<v Speaker 4>of the people that it's to these </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies that are benefiting from </v>

2430
01:38:48.391 --> 01:38:50.130
<v Speaker 4>keeping marijuana illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Period.</v>

2431
01:38:50.131 --> 01:38:50.964
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we'd have to figure out a </v>

2432
01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:53.870
<v Speaker 4>marijuana coalition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>

2433
01:38:54.010 --> 01:38:54.843
<v Speaker 4>we've got to figure out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there are fucking 100 million of </v>

2434
01:38:58.951 --> 01:39:00.630
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you in this country,</v>

2435
01:39:00.631 --> 01:39:01.464
<v Speaker 4>100 million people that smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of fucking people and that </v>

2436
01:39:04.801 --> 01:39:06.510
<v Speaker 4>number's going to grow a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

2437
01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:07.171
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2438
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 4>And it's going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more things are people are</v>

2439
01:39:10.090 --> 01:39:15.000
<v Speaker 5>jubilee room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really believe you fucking idiot.</v>

2440
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:16.300
<v Speaker 5>You fucking point.</v>

2441
01:39:18.230 --> 01:39:20.780
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might've made that number up.</v>

2442
01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2443
01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:24.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>

2444
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:25.623
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's probably at least close </v>
<v Speaker 4>because even when I was living down </v>

2445
01:39:27.891 --> 01:39:30.620
<v Speaker 4>south and I was hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives who love trump,</v>

2446
01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.720
<v Speaker 4>they smoked a little weed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking weed,</v>

2447
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:34.900
<v Speaker 4>not a little weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're smoking weed like crazy.</v>

2448
01:39:34.901 --> 01:39:36.170
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to get high.</v>

2449
01:39:36.230 --> 01:39:37.063
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that's wrong with it is </v>

2450
01:39:38.031 --> 01:39:40.490
<v Speaker 4>the fact that it's been buttoned down </v>
<v Speaker 4>into our brain,</v>

2451
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.433
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep in our memory through propaganda </v>

2452
01:39:44.031 --> 01:39:45.380
<v Speaker 4>that it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2453
01:39:45.381 --> 01:39:46.214
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you looked at the actual effects it </v>

2454
01:39:47.001 --> 01:39:49.100
<v Speaker 4>has on you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking about schizophrenia</v>

2455
01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.480
<v Speaker 4>and blaming marijuana on schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it still seems across the board it'd</v>

2456
01:39:53.481 --> 01:39:56.510
<v Speaker 4>be 1% it's the same thing with dummies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and lazy people.</v>

2457
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:58.850
<v Speaker 4>When dummies and lazy people find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>about pot,</v>

2458
01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.450
<v Speaker 4>it ruins the idea of it for other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2459
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.181
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>

2460
01:40:02.181 --> 01:40:03.980
<v Speaker 4>it's associated with his loud mouth </v>
<v Speaker 4>dummy.</v>

2461
01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.173
<v Speaker 4>His loud mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking lazy person never gets anything </v>

2462
01:40:06.651 --> 01:40:07.640
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's always broke.</v>

2463
01:40:07.641 --> 01:40:09.350
<v Speaker 4>So I was asking for money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pothead.</v>

2464
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Potheads don't get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't be a pothead.</v>

2465
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:13.190
<v Speaker 4>And then you get that in your head and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just run with it.</v>

2466
01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.053
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of men.</v>

2467
01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.170
<v Speaker 4>We know there's plenty of potheads that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are really industrious and hardworking.</v>

2468
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:18.573
<v Speaker 4>You know a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't attribute something that was </v>

2469
01:40:20.721 --> 01:40:22.640
<v Speaker 4>always part of someone's personality and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2470
01:40:22.641 --> 01:40:24.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana cause that.</v>

2471
01:40:24.710 --> 01:40:25.543
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't totally change the nature of </v>

2472
01:40:27.441 --> 01:40:28.274
<v Speaker 4>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that powerful of a fucking </v>

2473
01:40:29.781 --> 01:40:31.250
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nor does coffee.</v>

2474
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:32.143
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nor does alcohol nor do cigarettes for </v>

2475
01:40:33.921 --> 01:40:34.930
<v Speaker 4>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2476
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol can change some people.</v>

2477
01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.780
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was bad example.</v>

2478
01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Canada justice system is crumbling as </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabis rates continue.</v>

2479
01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.320
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2480
01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:46.333
<v Speaker 4>there've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there had been busted all these fucking </v>

2481
01:40:47.721 --> 01:40:48.470
<v Speaker 4>pot places.</v>

2482
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:53.470
<v Speaker 4>I thought you guys had your social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice warrior president and uh,</v>

2483
01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:54.483
<v Speaker 4>everybody was going to get to pick their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own gender pronouns and now you're </v>

2484
01:40:57.281 --> 01:40:58.114
<v Speaker 4>aerating pot places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaloga this 6,500 cases in provincial </v>

2485
01:41:02.111 --> 01:41:02.944
<v Speaker 4>court could be soon drop due to delays </v>
<v Speaker 4>including 38 for homicide or attempted </v>

2486
01:41:06.251 --> 01:41:08.530
<v Speaker 4>murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One terrible case last year,</v>

2487
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:09.364
<v Speaker 4>a man named Kenneth Williamson was </v>
<v Speaker 4>convicted of raping a minor over a </v>

2488
01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:12.514
<v Speaker 4>hundred times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because of lengthly delays and </v>

2489
01:41:14.411 --> 01:41:16.360
<v Speaker 4>taking his truck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his case to trial,</v>

2490
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.770
<v Speaker 4>his conviction was overturned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

2491
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.340
<v Speaker 4>is that so they could prosecute more </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana?</v>

2492
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:24.300
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just saying that they are there.</v>

2493
01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.153
<v Speaker 4>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're system is in such crisis and </v>

2494
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:29.403
<v Speaker 4>this marijuana case where they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>arresting all these people from </v>

2495
01:41:31.481 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insane because their justice system</v>

2496
01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:37.120
<v Speaker 4>is already in the crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it says,</v>

2497
01:41:37.121 --> 01:41:37.954
<v Speaker 4>considering the justice system crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabis should obviously be the lowest </v>

2498
01:41:40.271 --> 01:41:43.180
<v Speaker 4>priority for police and the courts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

2499
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:44.103
<v Speaker 4>not only your police launching more </v>
<v Speaker 4>raids against suspensory than ever </v>

2500
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:47.134
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ridiculous charges for small scale </v>

2501
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 4>cannabis crimes are con continuing from </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast to coast.</v>

2502
01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.633
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a justice system that's so </v>

2503
01:41:56.051 --> 01:42:01.051
<v Speaker 4>broken that they can't even convict </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who raped miners a hundred times.</v>

2504
01:42:02.291 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 4>They can't take them to trial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is there,</v>

2505
01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.733
<v Speaker 4>but it's that broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're still trying to fucking </v>

2506
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.200
<v Speaker 4>catch people for a smoking weed and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just a rating dispensary's and Shit.</v>

2507
01:42:13.511 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 4>Like if I had to get a waste of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2508
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:16.233
<v Speaker 4>if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's some sort of </v>

2509
01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 4>compartmentalism and that like the drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't,</v>

2510
01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:22.740
<v Speaker 4>they don't go after the other crimes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to do with it,</v>

2511
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.833
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a legal system that's </v>

2512
01:42:24.461 --> 01:42:25.294
<v Speaker 4>backed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to put more people into the legal </v>

2513
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:28.204
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because you have to somehow or </v>

2514
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:34.610
<v Speaker 4>another justify the position that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a cop of,</v>

2515
01:42:34.611 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 4>of a dea cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're called up there,</v>

2516
01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:38.680
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking crazy.</v>

2517
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:39.970
<v Speaker 4>You got a broken system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have,</v>

2518
01:42:39.971 --> 01:42:40.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2519
01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:42.440
<v Speaker 4>you're preying on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're locking people up.</v>

2520
01:42:42.441 --> 01:42:43.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean if you,</v>

2521
01:42:43.481 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 4>if you want to impress us then convict </v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucking a rapist.</v>

2522
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2523
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.233
<v Speaker 4>Don't fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2524
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.000
<v Speaker 4>prosecute people who are smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2525
01:42:52.001 --> 01:42:54.460
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing right now seems like a</v>

2526
01:42:54.461 --> 01:42:55.090
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2527
01:42:55.090 --> 01:42:59.770
<v Speaker 4>you're locking people up in a cage for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>plant that everybody on the planet knows</v>

2528
01:42:59.771 --> 01:43:00.604
<v Speaker 4>is not bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you just decide that because of </v>

2529
01:43:03.521 --> 01:43:06.220
<v Speaker 4>some fucking bullshit thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>written on paper,</v>

2530
01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 4>that you should be able to go against </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the science that's available today.</v>

2531
01:43:09.401 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 4>All the common sense and the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2532
01:43:11.831 --> 01:43:13.600
<v Speaker 4>And you should be able to go into </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's houses,</v>

2533
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.640
<v Speaker 4>going to people's businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arrest them,</v>

2534
01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.380
<v Speaker 4>take all their money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take all their pot.</v>

2535
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 4>That's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like a crime.</v>

2536
01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:20.763
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like you're using your </v>
<v Speaker 4>position and you're using it to just </v>

2537
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:26.850
<v Speaker 4>mark one up on the scoreboard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2538
01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.230
<v Speaker 4>we got some convictions today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good solid ones.</v>

2539
01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.133
<v Speaker 4>Bunch of dopers caught us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of dopers had to let that crazy </v>

2540
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.350
<v Speaker 4>pedophile go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we got all the dopay.</v>

2541
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:42.340
<v Speaker 4>It dopers real scourge of society to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred kids.</v>

2542
01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:43.240
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't,</v>

2543
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:45.400
<v Speaker 4>he didn't fuck them over by giving him </v>
<v Speaker 4>pot.</v>

2544
01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Casey wasn't smoking no weed.</v>

2545
01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.860
<v Speaker 4>It's those kids are going to remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he did to them.</v>

2546
01:43:50.861 --> 01:43:52.950
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to damage their memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2547
01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you remember it explicitly?</v>

2548
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2549
01:43:58.101 --> 01:44:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe that in this day and age</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit is still going on.</v>

2550
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Canada,</v>

2551
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.900
<v Speaker 4>I thought with this Trudeau guy was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be more progressive than ever,</v>

2552
01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>which Canadians are complaining about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>like crazy and you know,</v>

2553
01:44:12.261 --> 01:44:13.094
<v Speaker 4>I've had Jordan Peterson on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he hates what's going on now with </v>

2554
01:44:16.101 --> 01:44:16.934
<v Speaker 4>this push towards being as open minded </v>
<v Speaker 4>as possible with all these accepting of </v>

2555
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 4>the gender pronouns and that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have to start putting people,</v>

2556
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to start processing</v>

2557
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:28.034
<v Speaker 4>cases through the human rights council </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you don't use a person's </v>

2558
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:32.324
<v Speaker 4>proper gender pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could literally be considered a </v>

2559
01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:34.280
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>

2560
01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.970
<v Speaker 4>Like I think all that stuff on the left </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it goes way far,</v>

2561
01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.813
<v Speaker 4>it gets really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably a good thing to </v>

2562
01:44:39.531 --> 01:44:40.364
<v Speaker 4>balance out the stuff on the right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people figure out some sort of </v>

2563
01:44:43.161 --> 01:44:45.890
<v Speaker 4>comfortable medium that he's not being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that at all.</v>

2564
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:46.963
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2565
01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.700
<v Speaker 4>if the president is allowing this to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2566
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.580
<v Speaker 4>he's not being this progressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

2567
01:44:52.581 --> 01:44:53.414
<v Speaker 4>He's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's only going to be progressive </v>

2568
01:44:54.831 --> 01:44:55.664
<v Speaker 4>towards Trans Gender Pronouns and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever other ridiculous laws that </v>

2569
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 4>they're swamped with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2570
01:45:01.881 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 4>this is just a terrible precedent to </v>
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>

2571
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:05.263
<v Speaker 4>Allowing them to lock people up for pot </v>
<v Speaker 4>in 2017 is a fucking criminal waste of </v>

2572
01:45:10.731 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a criminal waste of manpower,</v>

2573
01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal,</v>

2574
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.333
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal intrusion on the freedom of </v>

2575
01:45:18.801 --> 01:45:19.634
<v Speaker 4>those people that you're locking up a </v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal on the disruption that you're </v>

2576
01:45:23.241 --> 01:45:26.150
<v Speaker 4>putting into their lives and the money </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're taking away from them for,</v>

2577
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 4>for trading out your economy as well.</v>

2578
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:29.083
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And fucking your economy up and these </v>

2579
01:45:30.171 --> 01:45:31.004
<v Speaker 4>people were trading in something that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>very valuable to the community and to </v>

2580
01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:36.170
<v Speaker 4>the human beings that consume it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:45:36.171 --> 01:45:37.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

2582
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I consider myself probably more liberal </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I am conservative,</v>

2583
01:45:41.541 --> 01:45:46.541
<v Speaker 4>but when I see the priorities of </v>
<v Speaker 4>liberals being identity,</v>

2584
01:45:47.211 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2585
01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 4>gender pronouns and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then so much of the real issues like</v>

2586
01:45:52.431 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 4>just get ignored like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2587
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.040
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes me hesitant to even say like,</v>

2588
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.903
<v Speaker 4>I'm a liberal or I'm more left wing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>right wing or whatever because I'm just </v>

2589
01:46:02.691 --> 01:46:03.021
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2590
01:46:03.021 --> 01:46:05.390
<v Speaker 4>your priorities are totally fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're totally out of order.</v>

2591
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2592
01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.233
<v Speaker 4>apparently in Canada they're fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these fucking politically correct </v>

2593
01:46:11.690 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 4>identity politics battles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can't deal with the pot issue.</v>

2594
01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:17.503
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna their police raids against</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot dispensaries are actually up and </v>

2595
01:46:20.121 --> 01:46:23.720
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to charge people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>petty fucking weed,</v>

2596
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:25.100
<v Speaker 4>smoking crimes.</v>

2597
01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:27.200
<v Speaker 4>And this is a thing that people always </v>
<v Speaker 4>go on about.</v>

2598
01:46:27.201 --> 01:46:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Like it's because it's pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like it's not a big issue.</v>

2599
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:33.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got bigger fish to fry.</v>

2600
01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at Tj,</v>

2601
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.833
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've been paying </v>

2602
01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:37.760
<v Speaker 4>attention to the stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2603
01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 4>Dj,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what the war in Afghanistan,</v>

2604
01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:40.520
<v Speaker 4>Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2605
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got problems.</v>

2606
01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:43.670
<v Speaker 4>Real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking pop thing.</v>

2607
01:46:43.671 --> 01:46:45.620
<v Speaker 4>You got damn potheads if it's off for </v>
<v Speaker 4>your pot,</v>

2608
01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:46.510
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I do?</v>

2609
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:47.343
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not that this what people have </v>

2610
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:52.200
<v Speaker 4>to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about personal freedom.</v>

2611
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.273
<v Speaker 4>It's about a person telling you what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do and enforcing it to the point of </v>

2612
01:46:57.031 --> 01:46:59.550
<v Speaker 4>putting you in a fucking cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that thing,</v>

2613
01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:00.384
<v Speaker 4>which had been an accepted part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization for thousands of years and </v>

2614
01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 4>is today accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an accepted part of civilization,</v>

2615
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 4>civilization right now.</v>

2616
01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.110
<v Speaker 4>But there's just these people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>engage in it,</v>

2617
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:13.944
<v Speaker 4>that don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that feel like they have the right </v>

2618
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 4>to go and lock people up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2619
01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:21.000
<v Speaker 4>when the trump administration started </v>
<v Speaker 4>signaling that they were going to,</v>

2620
01:47:21.110 --> 01:47:21.943
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take on weed or that they were thinking </v>

2621
01:47:23.851 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least that it was on the table,</v>

2622
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:29.490
<v Speaker 4>like stupid at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2623
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:31.410
<v Speaker 4>I made a video where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was basically,</v>

2624
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.810
<v Speaker 4>it was like making all the cases why </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is terrible.</v>

2625
01:47:33.811 --> 01:47:35.850
<v Speaker 4>This is a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2626
01:47:35.851 --> 01:47:36.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2627
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I made the economics argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made the personal freedom argument.</v>

2628
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I may,</v>

2629
01:47:40.981 --> 01:47:41.251
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2630
01:47:41.251 --> 01:47:42.084
<v Speaker 4>I pointed out the tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>revenue this is generating for the </v>

2631
01:47:44.071 --> 01:47:49.071
<v Speaker 4>states that have legalized it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a huge part of the response was just</v>

2632
01:47:49.861 --> 01:47:51.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2633
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

2634
01:47:52.681 --> 01:47:56.350
<v Speaker 4>He goes after trump when trump goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>after his precious weed,</v>

2635
01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:58.260
<v Speaker 4>when he cares.</v>

2636
01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:00.090
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing that got them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>care.</v>

2637
01:48:00.091 --> 01:48:00.924
<v Speaker 4>It's like fucking junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made fucking so many cogent arguments </v>

2638
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:06.684
<v Speaker 4>that hold water about the economic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal liberty ramifications of </v>

2639
01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:10.974
<v Speaker 4>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all you want to focus on is my </v>

2640
01:48:12.811 --> 01:48:16.320
<v Speaker 4>personal usage of this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance.</v>

2641
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.330
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Bet.</v>

2642
01:48:18.331 --> 01:48:19.164
<v Speaker 4>It's a good thing to talk about cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll get you talking about it like </v>

2643
01:48:21.421 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll get ya.</v>

2644
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:24.103
<v Speaker 4>It'll poke coucher they know because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they know that people like you and I </v>

2645
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.060
<v Speaker 4>really do enjoy our marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you tried to take away the pot,</v>

2646
01:48:30.061 --> 01:48:31.440
<v Speaker 4>we really do get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2647
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:32.303
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like kind of the like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was kind of like on the give trump a </v>

2648
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:37.350
<v Speaker 4>chance bandwagon until they started </v>
<v Speaker 4>signaling this stuff.</v>

2649
01:48:37.351 --> 01:48:40.110
<v Speaker 4>So that's why it really why I got shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

2650
01:48:40.111 --> 01:48:40.944
<v Speaker 4>very foolish thing to try to step in in </v>
<v Speaker 4>2017 with all the signs and all the </v>

2651
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:45.984
<v Speaker 4>information and the public opinion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that marijuana is something that </v>

2652
01:48:48.721 --> 01:48:51.000
<v Speaker 4>can get you locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get you locked up,</v>

2653
01:48:51.001 --> 01:48:52.320
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost as bad as heroin.</v>

2654
01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.290
<v Speaker 4>He's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a silly man.</v>

2655
01:48:55.291 --> 01:48:58.470
<v Speaker 4>That guy needs a pot Brownie more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything in this life.</v>

2656
01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:01.380
<v Speaker 4>He just needs a just a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just give them a quarter.</v>

2657
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.393
<v Speaker 4>Let him sit there and let him think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about his grandchildren and let them </v>

2658
01:49:04.231 --> 01:49:05.064
<v Speaker 4>think about fishing and let them think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about just napping in the sun and going </v>

2659
01:49:08.071 --> 01:49:10.710
<v Speaker 4>to meet the good Lord in a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have much time left,</v>

2660
01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:12.640
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to ruin it for potheads.</v>

2661
01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.150
<v Speaker 4>You're barely alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your hair's white,</v>

2662
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 4>your posture's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're standing there lying.</v>

2663
01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:21.540
<v Speaker 4>You're lying on television about heroin </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pot being like really close.</v>

2664
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.600
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy person who doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what pot does.</v>

2665
01:49:24.810 --> 01:49:25.643
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You obviously have no idea what it's </v>

2666
01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:28.194
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a person who's colorblind </v>

2667
01:49:29.311 --> 01:49:30.144
<v Speaker 4>describing some sort of a kaleidoscope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what you're even talking </v>

2668
01:49:33.181 --> 01:49:35.430
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for a guy like him,</v>

2669
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:40.880
<v Speaker 4>if you want to have a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about individual experiences,</v>

2670
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:41.933
<v Speaker 4>they should have had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're talking about someone </v>

2671
01:49:43.651 --> 01:49:44.484
<v Speaker 4>who's talking about the effects of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical and whether or not it should </v>

2672
01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.613
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should have had some sort of </v>

2673
01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 4>experience with that chemical.</v>

2674
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 4>They should know what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should understand it,</v>

2675
01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:56.290
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like marijuana.</v>

2676
01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.810
<v Speaker 4>So if you to talk about it and to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ridiculous,</v>

2677
01:49:58.811 --> 01:49:59.644
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

2678
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:03.520
<v Speaker 4>you can invest one evening in a safe </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2679
01:50:03.521 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 4>They'll do it in a laboratory or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital somewhere.</v>

2680
01:50:05.831 --> 01:50:09.160
<v Speaker 4>Pat Up the rooms and give you a pod </v>
<v Speaker 4>cookie and then put,</v>

2681
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:13.780
<v Speaker 4>put pink Floyd's the wall on just </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>

2682
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:16.510
<v Speaker 4>someone tell this fucking guy what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really is.</v>

2683
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Cause he's just talking out of his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2684
01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2685
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:21.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this is just apocryphal </v>
<v Speaker 4>or if they're,</v>

2686
01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.533
<v Speaker 4>this is an actual story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember there being something </v>

2687
01:50:23.921 --> 01:50:26.430
<v Speaker 4>about him saying that he thought the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the KKK,</v>

2688
01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.390
<v Speaker 4>we're good guys until he found out they </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoked weed.</v>

2689
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2690
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that was wrongly attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>him and that not only that,</v>

2691
01:50:33.731 --> 01:50:37.990
<v Speaker 4>there has been evidence that he's done </v>
<v Speaker 4>many things for civil rights.</v>

2692
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I had read that too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's,</v>

2693
01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:41.373
<v Speaker 4>it just might be the case of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>being overzealous and trying to paint a </v>

2694
01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:46.210
<v Speaker 4>demean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could find things,</v>

2695
01:50:46.211 --> 01:50:47.044
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that you've said or that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>started to take them completely out of </v>

2696
01:50:48.821 --> 01:50:49.654
<v Speaker 4>context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could paint a very different </v>

2697
01:50:50.411 --> 01:50:51.670
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

2698
01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:54.850
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking very hard to form an </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion of someone,</v>

2699
01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:57.430
<v Speaker 4>like a legitimate opinion if someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>without actually knowing them,</v>

2700
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:58.593
<v Speaker 4>but you can have an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that hard when they call and </v>

2701
01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:02.014
<v Speaker 4>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2702
01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:02.993
<v Speaker 4>that pod is nearly as dangerous as </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroin because then you did that person </v>

2703
01:51:05.801 --> 01:51:06.634
<v Speaker 4>at that point you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person is either delusional or is </v>

2704
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:10.450
<v Speaker 4>willfully deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2705
01:51:10.451 --> 01:51:13.420
<v Speaker 4>And the important part about it is it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just a person.</v>

2706
01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:15.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a person with an extreme amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

2707
01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a person,</v>

2708
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:19.480
<v Speaker 4>a very dangerous position of enforcing </v>
<v Speaker 4>laws and you go,</v>

2709
01:51:19.481 --> 01:51:21.670
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well will you think that that's crazy.</v>

2710
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:23.470
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>

2711
01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just drives me nuts because I think it</v>

2712
01:51:27.161 --> 01:51:28.690
<v Speaker 4>helps people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't.</v>

2713
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:29.583
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do think it's probably one of </v>

2714
01:51:31.991 --> 01:51:35.680
<v Speaker 4>the best elements in terms of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a happy,</v>

2715
01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:39.550
<v Speaker 4>healthy society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Staying grounded and being like a little</v>

2716
01:51:39.551 --> 01:51:40.630
<v Speaker 4>more kind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I give,</v>

2717
01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it gives you a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage more of kindness.</v>

2718
01:51:44.410 --> 01:51:44.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2719
01:51:44.921 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely seen it make people more</v>

2720
01:51:47.951 --> 01:51:50.710
<v Speaker 4>empathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more tolerant towards one another.</v>

2721
01:51:50.711 --> 01:51:53.800
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people who have anxiety that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it helps.</v>

2722
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.083
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people who have anxiety that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it exacerbates their anxiety to the </v>

2723
01:51:57.431 --> 01:51:58.630
<v Speaker 4>edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're sure?</v>

2724
01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.030

<v Speaker 4>brother at the beginning of show,</v>

2725
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:02.410

<v Speaker 4>feel better.</v>

2728
01:52:07.091 --> 01:52:09.430

<v Speaker 4>social situations.</v>

01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 4>Have him watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch all the things that turns into,</v>

2763
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:38.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor old guy.</v>

2764
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 4>It's going to go to his grave without </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying mushrooms.</v>

2765
01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.190
<v Speaker 4>It's going to go to his grave thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd is as bad as heroin.</v>

2766
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2767
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:46.550
<v Speaker 4>maybe he took mushrooms and that was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>revelation he had.</v>

2768
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.593
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is almost as bad as heroin is </v>

2769
01:53:50.730 --> 01:53:51.563
<v Speaker 4>so stupid because it doesn't kill you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually better for a lot of </v>

2770
01:53:55.401 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 4>people for pain than even heroin is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially edible pot.</v>

2771
01:53:59.190 --> 01:54:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Edible pod is supposed to be really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people that have chronic pain,</v>

2772
01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:04.250
<v Speaker 4>stump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive producer of information,</v>

2773
01:54:04.610 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 4>but you can function on it like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially physiologically.</v>

2774
01:54:08.691 --> 01:54:09.524
<v Speaker 4>You can function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you do something you already </v>

2775
01:54:10.851 --> 01:54:13.220
<v Speaker 4>know how to do and you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're high on pot,</v>

2776
01:54:13.221 --> 01:54:16.640
<v Speaker 4>especially edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have any like performance,</v>

2777
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like decreasing elements to it.</v>

2778
01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.550
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't decrease your performance.</v>

2779
01:54:22.551 --> 01:54:23.384
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do it right before they </v>

2780
01:54:25.071 --> 01:54:28.670
<v Speaker 4>do Jujitsu cause they think it increases</v>
<v Speaker 4>their performance zone.</v>

2781
01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:29.523
<v Speaker 4>Where I've known people who get high </v>
<v Speaker 4>before they go work out because they're </v>

2782
01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:31.641
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2783
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:32.474
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to keep me more focused and </v>

2784
01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:34.673
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're smoking like a </v>

2785
01:54:35.391 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 4>strong sativa strain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might give him a little energy burst.</v>

2786
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel it man.</v>

2787
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.600
<v Speaker 4>It feels like the fibers of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>muscles.</v>

2788
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:42.800
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Before Yoga.</v>

2789
01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:44.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

2790
01:54:44.091 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't really do a lot of like physical</v>
<v Speaker 4>activities that much,</v>

2791
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:49.730
<v Speaker 4>but like if I'm going to do like </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretching or something,</v>

2792
01:54:49.731 --> 01:54:51.750
<v Speaker 4>it's nice to be high and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

2793
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:55.060
<v Speaker 4>Cause the best your muscles are way more</v>
<v Speaker 4>relaxed and stuff.</v>

2794
01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.620
<v Speaker 4>You're able to get your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have like flexibility.</v>

2795
01:54:57.621 --> 01:54:58.454
<v Speaker 4>You don't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're just stone cold sober and all </v>

2796
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:03.050
<v Speaker 4>your tension is still there and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>

2797
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're high,</v>

2798
01:55:04.761 --> 01:55:06.650
<v Speaker 4>it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh you're supposed to be doing this.</v>

2799
01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:07.484
<v Speaker 4>You should do this more often dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you just have a better accounting </v>

2800
01:55:10.491 --> 01:55:12.590
<v Speaker 4>of what the signals your body sending </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2801
01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.900
<v Speaker 4>Cause I think when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're sober,</v>

2802
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.123
<v Speaker 4>you know you can try to think about all </v>
<v Speaker 4>your different areas and tune into the </v>

2803
01:55:19.611 --> 01:55:20.444
<v Speaker 4>body and all the various points of </v>
<v Speaker 4>contact where the elbows meet the </v>

2804
01:55:24.681 --> 01:55:27.050
<v Speaker 4>forearm and think about all the muscle </v>
<v Speaker 4>tissue.</v>

2805
01:55:27.051 --> 01:55:27.884
<v Speaker 4>But you'd have to like really go through</v>
<v Speaker 4>it like step by step and be really </v>

2806
01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:34.940
<v Speaker 4>conscious of what you're doing when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke pot.</v>

2807
01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:37.390
<v Speaker 4>It's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really enjoyed watching you fight with</v>

2808
01:55:37.391 --> 01:55:38.224
<v Speaker 4>a steven crowder about this by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh he's a silly boy when it comes to </v>

2809
01:55:41.451 --> 01:55:43.650
<v Speaker 4>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a silly boy overall.</v>

2810
01:55:43.651 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 4>I've had some</v>

2811
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.903
<v Speaker 2>dealings with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pop thing is interesting though </v>

2812
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:47.803
<v Speaker 2>cause he didn't want to even debate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when we were pulling up the </v>

2813
01:55:50.341 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 2>information he thought it was being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully because we were pulling up things.</v>

2814
01:55:52.981 --> 01:55:56.460
<v Speaker 2>It showed a contrary to what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about car accidents.</v>

2815
01:55:56.461 --> 01:56:01.461
<v Speaker 2>I've since looked into it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American Automobile Association has some</v>

2816
01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:05.070
<v Speaker 2>statistics where they think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing.</v>

2817
01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:08.460
<v Speaker 2>There's an increased number of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have marijuana in their system,</v>

2818
01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:10.470
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have the car accidents.</v>

2819
01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:11.304
<v Speaker 2>But the real problem with that is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be just as much of an increase in </v>

2820
01:56:14.521 --> 01:56:16.830
<v Speaker 2>those people smoking marijuana in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

2821
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.753
<v Speaker 2>It might not be related to the accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because it's connected to the </v>

2822
01:56:20.761 --> 01:56:22.450
<v Speaker 2>accident doesn't mean it caused the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

2823
01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Car accident argument too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2824
01:56:24.181 --> 01:56:25.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to realize alcohol is causing </v>

2825
01:56:26.911 --> 01:56:29.760
<v Speaker 2>way more traffic accidents than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than weed is.</v>

2826
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:31.290
<v Speaker 2>That was what they were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2827
01:56:31.291 --> 01:56:33.300
<v Speaker 2>in these places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of the places where people</v>

2828
01:56:33.301 --> 01:56:35.160
<v Speaker 2>were smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a decrease,</v>

2829
01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:39.870
<v Speaker 2>a decrease in Dui fatalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a decrease in violent crimes.</v>

2830
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:41.940
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a few different statistics</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at,</v>

2831
01:56:41.941 --> 01:56:42.774
<v Speaker 2>but Colorado seems to be saying there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a decrease in these car accidents and </v>

2832
01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:47.514
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2833
01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Dui related incidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2834
01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Steven crowder wanted to sue me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to tell you he wanted to</v>

2835
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:54.510
<v Speaker 2>see me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were on the same,</v>

2836
01:56:54.530 --> 01:56:55.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>network for a while on Youtube and it </v>

2837
01:56:57.961 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 2>was called poly pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy that was like my assigned,</v>

2838
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:04.380
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the position is called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2839
01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.440
<v Speaker 2>the fucking facilitator or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck he had the same one as I did.</v>

2840
01:57:10.501 --> 01:57:12.540
<v Speaker 2>And he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2841
01:57:12.541 --> 01:57:14.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that video you made about Steven crowder</v>

2842
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:16.320
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit,</v>

2843
01:57:16.321 --> 01:57:19.040
<v Speaker 2>cause he got in a fight with some union </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy on footage and he was like,</v>

2844
01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I was attacked by this union thug and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched him.</v>

2845
01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I looked at the footage and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

2846
01:57:24.630 --> 01:57:29.400
<v Speaker 2>this guy gets up from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's facing away from you.</v>

2847
01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:33.000
<v Speaker 2>It looked like someone pushed him from </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind because you see the whole video.</v>

2848
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of it.</v>

2849
01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:38.370
<v Speaker 2>The guy threw a punch at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the guy was on the fucking ground.</v>

2850
01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point.</v>

2851
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:40.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2852
01:57:40.591 --> 01:57:41.160
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2853
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:43.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't really see what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them when you see,</v>

2854
01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 2>you see the guy throw a punch at him </v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

2855
01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm very familiar with the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I looked at it,</v>

2858
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:50.070

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:50.933
<v Speaker 2>can we maybe see the guys in his face?</v>

2860
01:57:53.731 --> 01:57:57.420
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a grappling situation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy like physically manhandled them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't,</v>

2875
01:58:28.770 --> 01:58:30.990
<v Speaker 2>there's like a missing piece of footage </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2876
01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.220
<v Speaker 2>but in the footage I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see that guy attack him first.</v>

2877
01:58:35.221 --> 01:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>You see that guy get up from being on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground on his stomach.</v>

2878
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something,</v>

2879
01:58:41.190 --> 01:58:44.290
<v Speaker 2>so when I was thinking is through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that gets steven crowder pushed this</v>

2880
01:58:44.291 --> 01:58:45.340
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2881
01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 2>cause you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

2882
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:47.380
<v Speaker 2>there's no footage on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2883
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.273
<v Speaker 2>I surmised based on what I looked at in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the footage that this guy was maybe </v>

2884
01:58:51.221 --> 01:58:53.560
<v Speaker 2>pushed and then got up and then started </v>
<v Speaker 2>wailing on crowder.</v>

2885
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2886
01:58:55.050 --> 01:58:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And I put that out there and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing.</v>

2887
01:58:57.551 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>He said he was gonna sue me for what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about it.</v>

2888
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:01.953
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he then later went to court and a judge </v>

2889
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 2>looked at the footage and kind of came </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the same conclusion I did and said,</v>

2890
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:11.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that this went down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you're saying based on the footage.</v>

2891
01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:12.694
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost that court case and then he had </v>

2892
01:59:14.621 --> 01:59:18.160
<v Speaker 2>to drop any sort of idea of a lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>against me because the judge had already</v>

2893
01:59:18.161 --> 01:59:20.050
<v Speaker 2>ruled that the tape was bullshit.</v>

2894
01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Didn't really show what he thought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>said shed.</v>

2895
01:59:22.570 --> 01:59:23.403
<v Speaker 2>This is also instances where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged him to debates back in the </v>

2896
01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not recently,</v>

2897
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:28.743
<v Speaker 2>but he would never acknowledge me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at one time he did send his like </v>

2898
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:33.100
<v Speaker 2>little brother after me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brother?</v>

2899
01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:33.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know if it was his younger </v>

2900
01:59:34.511 --> 01:59:35.410
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his older brother,</v>

2901
01:59:35.411 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it was his little brother was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2902
01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking faggot or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2903
01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:41.420
<v Speaker 2>why won't your brother debate me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause we were at the time on the Seine,</v>

2904
01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.750
<v Speaker 2>that word you're saying he sent them </v>
<v Speaker 2>after you physically?</v>

2905
01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:44.613
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2906
01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:45.760
<v Speaker 2>just on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2907
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.140
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get best five.</v>

2908
01:59:47.141 --> 01:59:47.974
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two dudes are looking at each other </v>

2909
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:50.590
<v Speaker 2>outside of Barr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't come.</v>

2910
01:59:50.591 --> 01:59:53.020
<v Speaker 2>He didn't come and try to fucking fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>me up or anything.</v>

2911
01:59:53.021 --> 01:59:55.960
<v Speaker 2>He just talking shit on twitter and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk shit on twitter.</v>

2912
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:58.530
<v Speaker 2>You're sure that Steven's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was okay.</v>

2913
01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was steven's brother.</v>

2914
01:59:59.531 --> 02:00:02.230
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Stephen himself has never taught.</v>

2915
02:00:02.231 --> 02:00:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I made several videos about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not several like three.</v>

2916
02:00:05.250 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2917
02:00:06.671 --> 02:00:07.504
<v Speaker 2>but he's never confronted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polyprop tried to get us to do a debate </v>

2918
02:00:11.381 --> 02:00:12.214
<v Speaker 2>at the time he wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems when it's weird because like </v>

2919
02:00:14.651 --> 02:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>he's mister like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go like,</v>

2920
02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:19.180
<v Speaker 2>he just trolled Janky yogurt the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2921
02:00:19.181 --> 02:00:19.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2922
02:00:19.781 --> 02:00:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2923
02:00:21.101 --> 02:00:23.230
<v Speaker 2>his impression of Janky Yoga is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

2924
02:00:23.231 --> 02:00:25.930
<v Speaker 2>It is pretty spot on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that he did where he played Anna</v>

2925
02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and junk back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that.</v>

2926
02:00:28.150 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull it up.</v>

2927
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:32.080
<v Speaker 2>He'll let us use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like Steven crowder.</v>

2928
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

2929
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2930
02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2931
02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:37.960
<v Speaker 2>he's a little bit heavy on the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing.</v>

2932
02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>He gets a little silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does some funny shit like this.</v>

2933
02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And when he crashed genx thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with this,</v>

2934
02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.690
<v Speaker 2>the saddest thing was how Jank was </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to it.</v>

2935
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:47.524
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have any sense of humor about </v>

2936
02:00:48.761 --> 02:00:50.130
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2937
02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:52.670
<v Speaker 2>well Jank obviously takes himself very </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously for some reason.</v>

2938
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:58.530
<v Speaker 6>Do the research.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's absolutely correct.</v>

2939
02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:03.510
<v Speaker 6>You will have it listed a Goc I agree </v>
<v Speaker 6>with you.</v>

2940
02:01:03.511 --> 02:01:07.620
<v Speaker 6>Cenk so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's absolutely right.</v>

2941
02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.060
<v Speaker 6>When you use the f word,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2942
02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:12.600
<v Speaker 6>it's real time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we have a bunch of people anyway.</v>

2943
02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 2>You could see it online at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's porn bacon,</v>

2944
02:01:15.881 --> 02:01:18.040
<v Speaker 2>grease down his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was funny.</v>

2945
02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.350
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2946
02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:20.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2947
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:21.243
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reached out to be able to make fun of </v>

2948
02:01:22.151 --> 02:01:24.010
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recently sat down,</v>

2949
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:25.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did this.</v>

2950
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:27.183
<v Speaker 2>We went and watched a bunch of young </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turks videos so we could put out this </v>

2951
02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:32.950
<v Speaker 2>special drunken peasants versus the </v>
<v Speaker 2>young Turks.</v>

2952
02:01:33.690 --> 02:01:35.370
<v Speaker 2>A video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2953
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>we shot about five hours of us watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>young Turks videos and just tearing them</v>

2954
02:01:39.411 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one</v>

2955
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>of the things I noticed is what Jank </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do [inaudible] and watch for this.</v>

2956
02:01:44.361 --> 02:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>If you ever watch an his shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2957
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>he'll have his panel say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like super crazy left wing.</v>

2958
02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Like someone will say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like animal,</v>

2959
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>say it or one of the Steven O or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2960
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Whoever got on Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a wits,</v>

2961
02:01:58.040 --> 02:01:58.873
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say something that's real far </v>

2962
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>left wing and then it'll cut to Janke </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jank.</v>

2963
02:02:04.551 --> 02:02:05.384
<v Speaker 1>We'll have more of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moderate left wing opinion and then </v>

2964
02:02:08.991 --> 02:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>it'll go back to them and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately capitulate to Jank like,</v>

2965
02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jank you're,</v>

2966
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:14.571
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2967
02:02:14.571 --> 02:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is way more sensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>than what I said a second ago.</v>

2968
02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>And I just saw that pattern recurring </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again.</v>

2969
02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if that's like by design</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if they're just,</v>

2970
02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:23.924
<v Speaker 1>they feel like the need to capitulate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him because there they'd be scared of </v>

2971
02:02:26.421 --> 02:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>him or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2972
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:28.663
<v Speaker 1>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what it was definitely a lot of </v>

2973
02:02:30.261 --> 02:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

2974
02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:34.350
<v Speaker 4>What's going on there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of emotion in the way they</v>

2975
02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:38.550
<v Speaker 4>describe things and some people I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least initially connected to that,</v>

2976
02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.040
<v Speaker 4>but then they see where it gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>problematic.</v>

2977
02:02:41.041 --> 02:02:41.874
<v Speaker 4>If you're dealing with any like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious issue and you want to debate </v>

2978
02:02:44.851 --> 02:02:46.980
<v Speaker 4>just the facts like and have your ducks </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a row,</v>

2979
02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.873
<v Speaker 1>the wool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wool over my eyes was the Harris </v>

2980
02:02:49.801 --> 02:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>debate because think most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2981
02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:55.870
<v Speaker 1>That was like the first like major chink</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the chank ugur armor.</v>

2982
02:02:57.370 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 4>I never know how to pronounce his first </v>
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>

2983
02:02:58.881 --> 02:03:00.780
<v Speaker 4>So when you said it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like you,</v>

2984
02:03:00.910 --> 02:03:01.743
<v Speaker 4>you kind of think it's been changing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cenk in the Jank you've Cenk in the </v>

2985
02:03:04.671 --> 02:03:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Jank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2986
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:07.340
<v Speaker 4>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a good guy.</v>

2987
02:03:07.730 --> 02:03:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I liked talking to him too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think people handle certain types</v>

2988
02:03:12.201 --> 02:03:14.790
<v Speaker 4>of confrontation and disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2989
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:16.970
<v Speaker 4>and they don't handle the best way they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>

2990
02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.260
<v Speaker 4>And then those things escalate and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>compound and then it becomes who you are</v>

2991
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:22.183
<v Speaker 4>and then you defending who you are and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're always trying to argue with </v>

2992
02:03:24.741 --> 02:03:26.600
<v Speaker 4>people about who you are and what you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

2993
02:03:26.601 --> 02:03:28.150
<v Speaker 4>And like that's when you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:30.230
<v Speaker 4>It's when you're over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like we've done that,</v>

2995
02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:32.450
<v Speaker 4>we've done that and we've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've done that.</v>

2996
02:03:32.451 --> 02:03:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2997
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:36.320
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening in the world.</v>

2998
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:38.690
<v Speaker 4>That's all you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all any of us are doing.</v>

2999
02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.500
<v Speaker 4>That's all anybody's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're out there digging wells in</v>

3000
02:03:42.501 --> 02:03:43.334
<v Speaker 4>the Congo with Justin wren,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is you're talking </v>

3001
02:03:46.011 --> 02:03:46.844
<v Speaker 4>about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you got a bunch of people </v>

3002
02:03:48.381 --> 02:03:51.380
<v Speaker 4>listening to you talk about shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just talking about shit.</v>

3003
02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.393
<v Speaker 4>The end of the day you don't get any </v>
<v Speaker 4>extra points because more people are </v>

3004
02:03:55.371 --> 02:03:59.120
<v Speaker 4>listening or more people are watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your point isn't more valid.</v>

3005
02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Your point still has to stand up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketplace of ideas.</v>

3006
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:03.263
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yours is just as valid as his is </v>

3007
02:04:05.301 --> 02:04:07.300
<v Speaker 4>just as valid as mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3008
02:04:07.301 --> 02:04:09.410
<v Speaker 4>if the delivery system is a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>delivery system,</v>

3009
02:04:09.411 --> 02:04:12.080
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that like everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to stop.</v>

3010
02:04:12.710 --> 02:04:15.860
<v Speaker 4>I'd take you into account because you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>had more success in this market.</v>

3011
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:19.070
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy way of looking at shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3012
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:20.413
<v Speaker 4>And when him and Alex Jones battle back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and forth between who gets the most </v>

3013
02:04:24.141 --> 02:04:26.540
<v Speaker 4>viewers and who has the model like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

3014
02:04:26.541 --> 02:04:28.600
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

3015
02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:32.330
<v Speaker 4>when did you see when Alex went onto the</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage at south by southwest?</v>

3016
02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was south by southwest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>

3017
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:35.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last year.</v>

3018
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.680
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3019
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:37.770
<v Speaker 4>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was one of the greatest,</v>

3020
02:04:37.810 --> 02:04:38.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3021
02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trollings of all time.</v>

3022
02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:41.820
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jen got so mad.</v>

3023
02:04:41.970 --> 02:04:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I was furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then dumb ass that little,</v>

3024

<v Speaker 2>they oppose Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little weasel,</v>

3025
02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Dore spitting on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unfortunately Alex Jones did.</v>

3026
02:04:52.770 --> 02:04:53.603
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate that Guy Jimmy Dore </v>

3027
02:04:54.451 --> 02:04:55.480
<v Speaker 2>does some good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3028
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some of his stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a really good to put some really</v>

3029
02:04:58.561 --> 02:04:59.530
<v Speaker 2>good videos up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3030
02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:01.200
<v Speaker 2>he's done some really good work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3031
02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care for him.</v>

3032
02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3033
02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>but you recognize that some of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff's really good,</v>

3034
02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen this stuff.</v>

3035
02:05:09.571 --> 02:05:10.404
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe,</v>

3036
02:05:10.530 --> 02:05:11.700
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's out there.</v>

3037
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it makes some good points.</v>

3038
02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Very good points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3039
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:17.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3040
02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 2>when he was covering the whole Milo </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

3041
02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:20.094
<v Speaker 2>he played a very deceptive version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Milo clip and he credited us </v>

3042
02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:25.880
<v Speaker 2>basically as a podcast.</v>

3043
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:30.240
<v Speaker 2>And one that's talked about us is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this podcast from a basement</v>

3044
02:05:30.241 --> 02:05:31.950
<v Speaker 2>somewhere or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3045
02:05:31.951 --> 02:05:34.110
<v Speaker 2>isn't it funny that a podcast like </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours,</v>

3046
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:35.910
<v Speaker 2>which gets hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>downloads,</v>

3047
02:05:35.911 --> 02:05:36.744
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3048
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was more than that,</v>

3049
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>he would have to say the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

3050
02:05:41.461 --> 02:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if he was,</v>

3051
02:05:42.130 --> 02:05:45.390
<v Speaker 2>he was on the Adam Carolla show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would say the Adam Carolla show.</v>

3052
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's yours.</v>

3053
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:47.783
<v Speaker 2>Even though he knows what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not going to give these guys </v>

3054
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.200
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3055
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.810
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the media did that to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3056
02:05:51.811 --> 02:05:52.644
<v Speaker 2>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like transcripts of the Milo </v>

3057
02:05:54.571 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 2>episode where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then unknown host said this,</v>

3058
02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:00.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

3059
02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a bunker whites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys can't just look it up.</v>

3060
02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Aren't you supposed to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists?</v>

3061
02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Can't you figure out what the fuck the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast was?</v>

3062
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:12.750
<v Speaker 2>And I saw ones that attributed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3063
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:13.703
<v Speaker 2>stuff to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then had stuff of yours where they </v>

3064
02:06:17.761 --> 02:06:19.890
<v Speaker 2>didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that you guys had him</v>

3065
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:20.724
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that all the shit was coming </v>

3066
02:06:21.901 --> 02:06:22.734
<v Speaker 2>from my podcast because I got a text </v>
<v Speaker 2>message from my friend Chris Mcguire </v>

3067
02:06:25.951 --> 02:06:28.770
<v Speaker 2>informing me of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I went and I said,</v>

3068
02:06:28.771 --> 02:06:30.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't even my podcast.</v>

3069
02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3070
02:06:31.861 --> 02:06:32.694
<v Speaker 2>he was on your podcast too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they combined the two different </v>

3071
02:06:35.251 --> 02:06:36.480
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even saw people say like,</v>

3072
02:06:36.481 --> 02:06:40.190
<v Speaker 2>he was on Joe Rogan's drunken peasants </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

3073
02:06:40.191 --> 02:06:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3074
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:44.580
<v Speaker 2>people are supposed to trust you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking information.</v>

3075
02:06:44.581 --> 02:06:46.710
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be a fucking credible</v>
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>

3076
02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:49.380
<v Speaker 2>You can't even get this basic shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3077
02:06:49.381 --> 02:06:51.690
<v Speaker 2>So the media is a fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3078
02:06:51.691 --> 02:06:54.370
<v Speaker 2>the media now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's total fucking joke.</v>

3079
02:06:54.371 --> 02:06:56.400
<v Speaker 2>He's like a few places we could still </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>

3080
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Like where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3081
02:06:57.981 --> 02:07:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping you were on the answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know what?</v>

3082
02:07:00.781 --> 02:07:02.370
<v Speaker 2>People come to me all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3083
02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what news media outlet do you trust?</v>

3084

<v Speaker 2>none of them.</v>

3085
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust a single God damn fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3086
02:07:08.551 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Any of these institutions have to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever Megan Kelly has to say.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dressed,</v>

3100
02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 2>talking about guns and the war and crime</v>
<v Speaker 2>and poverty and pot and prison.</v>

3101

<v Speaker 2>You know the fucking bitch I really </v>

3102
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:48.310
<v Speaker 2>hated back in the day was a nancy grace.</v>

3104
02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Stole the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's horrible.</v>

3105
02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moral indignation that she has over</v>

3106
02:07:54.911 --> 02:07:56.380
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything is always like,</v>

3109
02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that constant,</v>

3110
02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:03.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm indignant about everything in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and I'm this great moral judge </v>

3111
02:08:06.311 --> 02:08:07.144
<v Speaker 2>here to fucking tell people what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really what another dead baby in </v>

3113
02:08:14.411 --> 02:08:15.244
<v Speaker 2>she's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when she went up to those Duke </v>

3114
02:08:16.511 --> 02:08:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Lacrosse kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3115
02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:21.100
<v Speaker 2>The fake rape case and then never </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologized.</v>

3116
02:08:21.250 --> 02:08:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Now why would she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's perfect.</v>

3117
02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:24.123
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's probably still thinks those kids </v>

3118
02:08:25.061 --> 02:08:27.670
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that.</v>

3119
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine being those kids and go home.</v>

3120
02:08:30.001 --> 02:08:32.890
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck we didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3121
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Nancy grace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show up.</v>

3122
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Nancy grace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the truth.</v>

3123
02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Those boys are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's made her entire career off of like</v>

3124
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:46.143
<v Speaker 2>exploiting the worst human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their worst case scenarios and then </v>

3125
02:08:50.471 --> 02:08:52.690
<v Speaker 2>putting it on tv and getting everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged.</v>

3126
02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] machine hot mom.</v>

3127
02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:59.230
<v Speaker 2>She was the one who was chasing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady down that killed her kid.</v>

3128
02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Casey Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

3129
02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.380
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was her big bloodhound moment.</v>

3130
02:09:02.381 --> 02:09:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Nancy Grace Review renews her criticism </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Taught Mom.</v>

3131
02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck is Tottenham renewing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's that lady that killed her kid.</v>

3132
02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:12.993
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3133
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3134
02:09:15.090 --> 02:09:17.290
<v Speaker 2>so it's Casey and Casey Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3135
02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard her called tot mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

3136
02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who she calls her or taught mom.</v>

3137
02:09:22.601 --> 02:09:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I tried to avoid experiencing Nancy </v>
<v Speaker 2>grace on any level.</v>

3138
02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see her debate with two </v>
<v Speaker 2>chains?</v>

3139
02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Now they debated about pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two chainz and Nancy grace.</v>

3140
02:09:31.781 --> 02:09:34.690
<v Speaker 2>We're debating about pod on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the most ridiculous shit ever.</v>

3141
02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Two chains and that have actually seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3142
02:09:36.641 --> 02:09:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Now that you mention it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3143
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Why they let two Chainz do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause she probably thought he was a soft</v>

3144
02:09:41.861 --> 02:09:44.350
<v Speaker 2>target that she could just row </v>
<v Speaker 2>steamrolled in.</v>

3145
02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to do that with her,</v>

3146
02:09:46.991 --> 02:09:49.180
<v Speaker 2>you'd need to be in the room too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be on that split screen.</v>

3147
02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:51.470
<v Speaker 2>They talk over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could barely hear them.</v>

3148
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:52.960
<v Speaker 2>This delay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's confusing.</v>

3149
02:09:53.170 --> 02:09:54.940
<v Speaker 2>They know what the fuck they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll split,</v>

3150
02:09:54.941 --> 02:09:56.020
<v Speaker 2>scream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are weird.</v>

3151
02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:58.270
<v Speaker 2>You have something in your ear and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to them.</v>

3152
02:09:58.280 --> 02:09:58.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't see them.</v>

3153
02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.760
<v Speaker 2>You're staring right at camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3154
02:10:00.761 --> 02:10:01.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

3155
02:10:01.141 --> 02:10:02.950
<v Speaker 2>when I wasn't looking at them and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on CNN,</v>

3156
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:04.083
<v Speaker 2>like not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I was in a huge gigantic room </v>

3157
02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:08.463
<v Speaker 2>and the camera was like 30 feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm looking at this camera that's </v>

3158
02:10:12.161 --> 02:10:14.700
<v Speaker 2>like in the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like talking and nothing it,</v>

3159
02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:19.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking earpiece in my ear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that keeps falling out and it's designed</v>

3160
02:10:20.201 --> 02:10:21.034
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3161
02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:23.140
<v Speaker 2>It's designed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3162
02:10:23.141 --> 02:10:25.780
<v Speaker 2>first of all for convenience for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the people that are filming.</v>

3163
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also like the best way to get a good</v>

3164
02:10:29.351 --> 02:10:30.184
<v Speaker 2>reaction out of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guest is put the guests under </v>

3165
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them on a press button and then some</v>

3166
02:10:34.101 --> 02:10:34.934
<v Speaker 2>weird situation and have some smooth </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking cukor Tucker Carlson type </v>

3167
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.810
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

3168
02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:39.933
<v Speaker 2>Tucker Tucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really disappointed he didn't stick </v>

3169
02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>with the bow tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping I am too,</v>

3170
02:10:44.451 --> 02:10:44.950
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

3171
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:48.990
<v Speaker 2>He seems like his ratings or better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the bow tie this fucking lot.</v>

3172
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.843
<v Speaker 2>But like I remember like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love how every fucking answer anyone </v>

3173
02:10:52.281 --> 02:10:54.440
<v Speaker 2>gives to him on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always does this like,</v>

3174
02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:56.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

3177
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:03.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an interesting guy.</v>

3178
02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:08.120
<v Speaker 2>He's sort of taking this middleman </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican approach,</v>

3179
02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:10.460
<v Speaker 2>sort of the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3180
02:11:10.461 --> 02:11:11.294
<v Speaker 2>like more reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more towards the middle will </v>

3181
02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:14.960
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I understand your position?</v>

3182
02:11:14.961 --> 02:11:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

3183
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 2>let me go over your position one more </v>
<v Speaker 2>time please.</v>

3184
02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.553
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3185
02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 2>he's sort of semi mocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but clearly on the right.</v>

3186
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3187
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great thing too is that he's kind of</v>

3188
02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:27.020
<v Speaker 2>brought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3189
02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:31.700
<v Speaker 2>that Internet strain of conservatism </v>
<v Speaker 2>over to Fox News.</v>

3190
02:11:31.701 --> 02:11:32.534
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3191
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Bill O'reilly and Sean Hannity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not tapped into that shit.</v>

3192
02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3193
02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Bill Tucker is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3194
02:11:38.091 --> 02:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>And it's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3195
02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:39.913
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3196
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:40.671
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3197
02:11:40.671 --> 02:11:42.770
<v Speaker 2>he's basically appealing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3198
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.840
<v Speaker 2>probably a younger conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographic.</v>

3199
02:11:44.841 --> 02:11:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine than than Hannity and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>o'reilly get,</v>

3200
02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:49.273
<v Speaker 2>he's appealing to the people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen one too many Alex Jones videos </v>

3201
02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:55.160
<v Speaker 2>where they've gotten to that one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

3202
02:11:55.161 --> 02:11:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>

3203
02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:01.050
<v Speaker 2>And then they go over to Tucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was it,</v>

3204
02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:04.250
<v Speaker 2>what was it like having him having him </v>
<v Speaker 2>on here by the way,</v>

3205
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a dream come true.</v>

3206
02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Like sit and face to face and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him talk.</v>

3207
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:10.243
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been friends with them for a long </v>

3208
02:12:10.641 --> 02:12:11.474
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on that guy since 1999 I think it </v>

3209
02:12:14.601 --> 02:12:16.250
<v Speaker 2>was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fun for me,</v>

3210
02:12:16.251 --> 02:12:17.084
<v Speaker 2>but it was also something like for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longest time people thought I was </v>

3211
02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:22.070
<v Speaker 2>avoiding having him on for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he kept saying,</v>

3212
02:12:22.130 --> 02:12:22.963
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to get ahold of Joe Rogan every </v>

3213
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.650
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom and Tom,</v>

3214
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but he blows me off.</v>

3215
02:12:26.090 --> 02:12:28.730
<v Speaker 2>He was always texting the wrong number.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I show Joe Rogan's been avoiding me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to get in there to give</v>

3223
02:12:41.601 --> 02:12:45.590

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3407
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:40.280

3408
02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.780
<v Speaker 2>I was depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll stop right there.</v>

3409
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Stop right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one's going to believe you.</v>

3410
02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Change your fucking accent to a mocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>southern accent.</v>

3411
02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:47.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you can't do that for you,</v>

3412
02:19:47.931 --> 02:19:50.450
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just run through how we would have</v>

3413
02:19:50.451 --> 02:19:51.200
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3414
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:52.630
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to reinvent you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3415
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.440
<v Speaker 2>let's just say the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>

3416
02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move so far into conservatism.</v>

3417
02:19:56.631 --> 02:19:58.580
<v Speaker 2>That is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being an atheist is dangerous,</v>

3418
02:19:58.581 --> 02:20:02.150
<v Speaker 2>being a liberal and you've got a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of financial requirements.</v>

3419
02:20:02.151 --> 02:20:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got a mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3420
02:20:03.861 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe you got a car payment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3421
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:06.403
<v Speaker 2>well fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get this money to keep coming </v>

3422
02:20:07.581 --> 02:20:09.020
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm going to do.</v>

3423
02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to reinvent myself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a performance art piece I do</v>

3424
02:20:12.411 --> 02:20:14.540
<v Speaker 2>for a few years or become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

3425
02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Come conservative Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3426
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Give my life over to Jesus.</v>

3427
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:20.570
<v Speaker 2>What would be the event that we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to talk about?</v>

3428
02:20:20.571 --> 02:20:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd have to describe an event that</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated you to make the big chain.</v>

3429
02:20:24.610 --> 02:20:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to be something that I could,</v>

3430
02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I could fake easily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems credible and believable.</v>

3431
02:20:29.631 --> 02:20:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe a little baby heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3432
02:20:32.271 --> 02:20:33.170
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3434
02:20:34.271 --> 02:20:35.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it'd be like I had my heart </v>

3435
02:20:35.751 --> 02:20:38.360
<v Speaker 2>attack and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even fucking,</v>

3436
02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:42.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could spend some kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>near death yarn or some shit.</v>

3437
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3438
02:20:42.891 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you blacked out.</v>

3439
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.983
<v Speaker 2>Like something happened yet to like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little minor heart attack and your legs </v>

3440
02:20:47.061 --> 02:20:48.350
<v Speaker 2>stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You blacked out.</v>

3441
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:49.543
<v Speaker 2>And I saw it was in a tunnel and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lights and I felt like a presence </v>

3442
02:20:53.601 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 2>and an energy love that I'd never </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced before.</v>

3443
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.740
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did,</v>

3444
02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.590
<v Speaker 2>what was your initial reaction to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and this experience?</v>

3445
02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um hmm.</v>

3446
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:04.993
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3447
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.960
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord,</v>

3448
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:07.550
<v Speaker 2>should we go the hell route?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we go?</v>

3449
02:21:07.551 --> 02:21:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3450
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I was cast out of this place and I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hell.</v>

3451
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Or is that too over the top?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my take on things.</v>

3452
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I believe.</v>

3453
02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I believe you're allowed to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>God all day long,</v>

3454
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:18.283
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you talk about the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only a select group of people are going </v>

3455
02:21:20.911 --> 02:21:21.830
<v Speaker 2>to hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3456
02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:22.664
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about your cause more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in God and believing in the </v>

3457
02:21:24.481 --> 02:21:25.610
<v Speaker 2>whole fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3458
02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's culturally acceptable to describe a</v>

3459
02:21:29.121 --> 02:21:32.660
<v Speaker 2>belief in a higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't even say God,</v>

3460
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for 90% of the people.</v>

3461
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

3462
02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:40.670
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is say I'm spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm nondenominational,</v>

3463
02:21:40.671 --> 02:21:41.690
<v Speaker 2>but I'm spiritual.</v>

3464
02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:44.540
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately I believe in a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

3465
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's very possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

3466
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:47.703
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I leave the option areas like the seven </v>

3467
02:21:49.371 --> 02:21:52.550
<v Speaker 2>planets fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's that?</v>

3468
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:53.390
<v Speaker 2>They say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3469
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:54.223
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a reincarnation trope where </v>

3470
02:21:55.581 --> 02:21:58.480
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go through like seven stages of,</v>

3471
02:21:58.530 --> 02:22:03.260
<v Speaker 2>of life where like the first year I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think humans are like second or third on</v>

3472
02:22:03.261 --> 02:22:05.030
<v Speaker 2>the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But eventually,</v>

3473
02:22:05.031 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 2>like in your seventh life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become like a being of a,</v>

3474
02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:11.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not necessarily your seventh</v>

3475
02:22:11.421 --> 02:22:12.140
<v Speaker 2>cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3476
02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you're like repeatedly attempting you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you become like an enlightened being.</v>

3477
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:16.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're,</v>

3478
02:22:16.131 --> 02:22:17.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a shitty human being,</v>

3479
02:22:17.811 --> 02:22:20.180
<v Speaker 2>you might get sent back or you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>just be a human being again,</v>

3480
02:22:20.181 --> 02:22:21.014
<v Speaker 2>but eventually you get reincarnated is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an immortal being of the pure </v>

3481
02:22:25.891 --> 02:22:26.700
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment</v>

3482
02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:28.950
<v Speaker 4>and just did one with the cosmos and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit.</v>

3483
02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:29.940
<v Speaker 4>I got Dalai Lama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3484
02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 4>you could do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

3485
02:22:30.931 --> 02:22:32.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you put the pedal that new age shit,</v>

3486
02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:35.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they've,</v>

3487
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:37.650
<v Speaker 4>they like said it and I'm like seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>different planets too.</v>

3488
02:22:37.651 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Like you go from one planet to the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you progress up the ladder of fucking</v>

3489
02:22:42.241 --> 02:22:43.950
<v Speaker 4>liars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This all of us.</v>

3490
02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:45.720
<v Speaker 4>But what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What religion is this one?</v>

3491
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:46.913
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just some crazy shit I heard one </v>

3492
02:22:47.881 --> 02:22:48.714
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could roll with that seven </v>

3493
02:22:51.121 --> 02:22:51.900
<v Speaker 4>planets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3494
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:55.130
<v Speaker 4>You have seven times to re reinvent </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and like totally.</v>

3495
02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:57.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have my shit together now.</v>

3496
02:22:57.121 --> 02:22:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm 500 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm totally together.</v>

3497
02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Finally I can say I'm whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3498
02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:03.803
<v Speaker 4>Then you ascend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you're saying you send to </v>

3499
02:23:05.011 --> 02:23:05.844
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment to the seventh planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you live out the rest of your </v>

3500
02:23:08.461 --> 02:23:09.090
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>

3501
02:23:09.090 --> 02:23:09.923
<v Speaker 4>So in pure love and joy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we just had you talking on CNN again </v>

3502
02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:15.840
<v Speaker 4>and they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3503
02:23:15.841 --> 02:23:16.674
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what inspired you to make this decision </v>

3504
02:23:19.530 --> 02:23:24.480
<v Speaker 4>after all your years of atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube videos to become a Christian and</v>

3505
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:27.960
<v Speaker 4>now that you are a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you going to take those videos down?</v>

3506
02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:31.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to leave them up so people can</v>

3507
02:23:31.201 --> 02:23:34.260
<v Speaker 4>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really was this atheist.</v>

3508
02:23:34.261 --> 02:23:38.100
<v Speaker 4>I really did give credence to these </v>
<v Speaker 4>atheist beliefs,</v>

3509
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:40.140
<v Speaker 4>but now I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just,</v>

3510
02:23:40.141 --> 02:23:40.974
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've rejected that all and in fact I'm </v>

3511
02:23:42.631 --> 02:23:43.464
<v Speaker 4>going to go through all my old videos </v>
<v Speaker 4>and rebut them and show where I was </v>

3512
02:23:47.221 --> 02:23:50.790
<v Speaker 4>wrong and explain why I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So stay tuned for that.</v>

3513
02:23:51.130 --> 02:23:52.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genius.</v>

3514
02:23:52.081 --> 02:23:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can also say,</v>

3515
02:23:54.570 --> 02:23:55.403
<v Speaker 4>you know what's really ironic is I did </v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan's podcast and we joked around </v>

3516
02:23:59.311 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 4>about this happening and then it did </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

3517
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:02.213
<v Speaker 4>And it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just fucked this whole plan because </v>

3518
02:24:03.890 --> 02:24:04.890
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all public.</v>

3519
02:24:04.891 --> 02:24:05.251
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3520
02:24:05.251 --> 02:24:06.680
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not because it's your,</v>

3521
02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:07.523
<v Speaker 4>your belief in the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So powerful that despite the fact that </v>

3522
02:24:09.811 --> 02:24:10.644
<v Speaker 4>you talked about faking it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to talk about it in the </v>

3523
02:24:12.691 --> 02:24:14.760
<v Speaker 4>exact same way because it actually did </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

3524
02:24:15.010 --> 02:24:16.980
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like God was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3525
02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:18.300
<v Speaker 4>you think you're so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tj?</v>

3526
02:24:18.450 --> 02:24:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you.</v>

3527
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:21.630
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you and I'll have the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>same scenario,</v>

3528
02:24:21.631 --> 02:24:24.420
<v Speaker 4>play itself out and I will show myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>to you and I will touch your heart.</v>

3529
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:25.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there you got.</v>

3530
02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:26.460
<v Speaker 4>The Lord did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He touched my heart,</v>

3531
02:24:26.850 --> 02:24:27.840
<v Speaker 4>tj.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a few,</v>

3532
02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:30.840
<v Speaker 4>a scant few years later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much my heart,</v>

3533
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:33.450
<v Speaker 4>how much you think Joel Olsteen clears </v>
<v Speaker 4>in one day.</v>

3534
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:34.553
<v Speaker 4>We can look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can look and his net worth some </v>

3535
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:39.620
<v Speaker 4>probably scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's that's gotta be here.</v>

3536
02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly what it's worth.</v>

3537
02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:46.100
<v Speaker 4>56 million lives in a $10 million house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good little good little scan he's</v>

3538
02:24:48.421 --> 02:24:49.254
<v Speaker 4>got going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably more ag balling Hashtag </v>

3539
02:24:52.681 --> 02:24:54.660
<v Speaker 4>ball and for Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

3540
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:56.280
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does one justify that?</v>

3541
02:24:56.281 --> 02:24:59.220
<v Speaker 4>We had this guy on will mccaskill who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3542
02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:02.640
<v Speaker 4>runs this organization called effective </v>
<v Speaker 4>altruism.</v>

3543
02:25:02.970 --> 02:25:07.970
<v Speaker 4>He donates all of his income above </v>
<v Speaker 4>$35,000 so he gets to $35,000.</v>

3544
02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:10.170
<v Speaker 4>He keeps that everything else he </v>
<v Speaker 4>donates.</v>

3545
02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a real holy man.</v>

3546
02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:13.651
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3547
02:25:13.651 --> 02:25:14.484
<v Speaker 4>he's just living laughable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Olsteen $56 million net worth $10 </v>

3548
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:20.220
<v Speaker 4>million just comes home and his gold </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwear.</v>

3549
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:21.833
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3550
02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:23.560
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3551
02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:25.960
<v Speaker 4>he's built prosperity into the his </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrine.</v>

3552
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Cause what he pedals is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

3553
02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:29.433
<v Speaker 4>if you're good and God loves you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God wants you to be successful and </v>

3554
02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:33.004
<v Speaker 4>prosperous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now there's nothing in Christian </v>

3555
02:25:35.321 --> 02:25:36.154
<v Speaker 4>doctrine actually back that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Christians are persecuted and God </v>

3556
02:25:38.531 --> 02:25:40.420
<v Speaker 4>does not give them an easy life.</v>

3557
02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:41.253
<v Speaker 4>They get crucified upside down and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>get persecuted by authorities and all </v>

3558
02:25:44.051 --> 02:25:44.884
<v Speaker 4>sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's figured out some way to spin </v>

3559
02:25:46.811 --> 02:25:49.450
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you love God and God loves you,</v>

3560
02:25:49.451 --> 02:25:52.090
<v Speaker 4>that God wants you to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So basically his,</v>

3561
02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.550
<v Speaker 4>all his money in his houses and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosperity,</v>

3562
02:25:54.551 --> 02:25:55.384
<v Speaker 4>that's all that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God gave that to me and that's part of </v>

3563
02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:00.130
<v Speaker 4>my faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3564
02:26:00.131 --> 02:26:01.390
<v Speaker 4>but you asked for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

3565
02:26:01.450 --> 02:26:03.040
<v Speaker 4>you asked for money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people paid,</v>

3566
02:26:03.041 --> 02:26:05.440
<v Speaker 4>they paid to hear the word of God and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hearing it through you.</v>

3567
02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:06.333
<v Speaker 4>God didn't get involved at any point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens if somebody really </v>

3568
02:26:09.011 --> 02:26:13.120
<v Speaker 4>charismatic who's really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decides to play that as a scam?</v>

3569
02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:14.493
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happened a bunch of time start </v>

3570
02:26:15.681 --> 02:26:16.514
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like someone is like a really good </v>

3571
02:26:18.131 --> 02:26:19.750
<v Speaker 4>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Denzel Washington,</v>

3572
02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Denzel Washington becomes a religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>icon too.</v>

3573
02:26:22.410 --> 02:26:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if Denzel Washington </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a nowhere had some religious epiphany</v>

3574
02:26:27.941 --> 02:26:32.941
<v Speaker 4>or faked it and then decided to go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>television and and,</v>

3575
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:34.023
<v Speaker 4>and had like a very powerful message for</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and then started making youtube </v>

3576
02:26:37.361 --> 02:26:39.880
<v Speaker 4>videos and then started preaching and </v>
<v Speaker 4>arenas.</v>

3577
02:26:40.030 --> 02:26:41.710
<v Speaker 4>People would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

3578
02:26:41.711 --> 02:26:43.720
<v Speaker 4>you would leave there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your life would be changed.</v>

3579
02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:44.973
<v Speaker 4>Denzel Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Denzel Washington from like training </v>

3580
02:26:48.491 --> 02:26:49.324
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the kind of fucking power that guy </v>

3581
02:26:51.701 --> 02:26:54.190
<v Speaker 4>can deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he could deliver a sermon like that,</v>

3582
02:26:54.370 --> 02:26:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Joel Olsteen would just jump off a </v>
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

3583
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.903
<v Speaker 4>He would watch that and go with the FEC </v>
<v Speaker 4>business and Joel Olsteen would be like </v>

3584
02:27:00.521 --> 02:27:02.500
<v Speaker 4>his opening act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If an email is,</v>

3585
02:27:02.501 --> 02:27:05.650
<v Speaker 4>it would be like the shitty opening band</v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one cares about.</v>

3586
02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you got like a real actor,</v>

3587
02:27:07.751 --> 02:27:11.680
<v Speaker 4>like a real powerful actor to go up </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and do it in a real,</v>

3588
02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:15.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a guy like Leonardo Dicaprio,</v>

3589
02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:16.443
<v Speaker 4>like Leonardo Dicaprio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a problem with Leo is he's too </v>

3590
02:27:19.211 --> 02:27:21.970
<v Speaker 4>handsome and he gets too much posey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to take them seriously.</v>

3591
02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:24.310
<v Speaker 4>You just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just got too much money.</v>

3592
02:27:24.430 --> 02:27:28.270
<v Speaker 4>He's always bawling on all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world is on yachts with models.</v>

3593
02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:29.860
<v Speaker 4>Too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

3594
02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:30.873
<v Speaker 4>But if we could get past that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somehow or another we could get past </v>

3595
02:27:33.791 --> 02:27:35.140
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if that guy has settled down,</v>

3596
02:27:35.141 --> 02:27:35.974
<v Speaker 4>he had a wife and he had a kid and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>he had some religious epiphany and then </v>

3597
02:27:40.031 --> 02:27:40.864
<v Speaker 4>he really got close to the Lord and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was really like gathering up the </v>

3598
02:27:43.061 --> 02:27:44.920
<v Speaker 4>scripture and then he started fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>preaching.</v>

3599
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:48.460
<v Speaker 4>You really want this happen to you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can sense it in you like,</v>

3603
02:27:55.060 --> 02:28:00.060

<v Speaker 4>doing it that way.</v>

3606
02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:09.430
<v Speaker 4>The only way you do it that way is you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to put on a performance.</v>

3607
02:28:09.431 --> 02:28:10.264
<v Speaker 4>If you've got to stand in front of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people and talk about what the </v>

3608
02:28:13.121 --> 02:28:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Lord does to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever.</v>

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:18.430
<v Speaker 4>What do you have passion for it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is an orchestrated performance.</v>

3610
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:20.330
<v Speaker 4>It's an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your design,</v>

02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:22.520
<v Speaker 4>your riling sensibilities</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3614
02:28:29.781 --> 02:28:32.450
<v Speaker 2>it's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pay a bunch of money to get no arena</v>

3615
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:36.560
<v Speaker 2>and some con man screams and yells about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lord and pretends that he could read</v>

3616
02:28:36.561 --> 02:28:37.394
<v Speaker 2>people's minds and heal the sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those motherfuckers that touch people </v>

3632
02:29:27.291 --> 02:29:28.124
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the way they make a </v>

<v Speaker 2>it would be hot Christian Pussy.</v>

3650

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3653
02:30:11.751 --> 02:30:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I just noticed that the Christian Pussy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just way higher caliber,</v>

3654
02:30:14.631 --> 02:30:17.390
<v Speaker 2>so it's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're freaks,</v>

3655
02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:19.490
<v Speaker 2>they're all suppressed and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally get him alone,</v>

3656
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:21.650
<v Speaker 2>they think Jesus isn't looking.</v>

3658
02:30:24.210 --> 02:30:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if like it took a few years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you had made it,</v>

02:30:28.850 --> 02:30:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I converted because Christian Pussy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best pussy.</v>

3661
02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:34.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not even close.</v>

3662
02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:36.470
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

3663
02:30:36.530 --> 02:30:37.363
<v Speaker 2>Why do we mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to believe in Jesus when you </v>

3664
02:30:38.781 --> 02:30:39.614
<v Speaker 2>just know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you know you fucking atheist </v>

3665

<v Speaker 2>pussy or a pagan pussy or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3666
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:46.070
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this is okay,</v>

3667
02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:50.330
<v Speaker 2>but you hit that Christian pussy and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just feel that the might of God touching</v>

3668
02:30:50.331 --> 02:30:53.180
<v Speaker 2>your cock is almost like Jesus himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>is giving you a hand job.</v>

3669
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:54.283
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if there was a belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that changed the way your pussy </v>

3670
02:30:57.171 --> 02:30:58.190
<v Speaker 2>felt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

3671
02:30:58.230 --> 02:31:00.230
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you knew that the girl didn't believe</v>

3672
02:31:00.231 --> 02:31:01.064
<v Speaker 2>in Jesus when you had sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like oh it was all wishy washy down </v>

3673
02:31:03.051 --> 02:31:04.750
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No structure.</v>

3674
02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:06.373
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about this the </v>

3675
02:31:07.911 --> 02:31:11.060
<v Speaker 2>other day about wild pigs that when wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs get loose,</v>

3676
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:13.190
<v Speaker 2>like you take a domestic pig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get loose,</v>

3677
02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:15.530
<v Speaker 2>their body morphs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their snout grows,</v>

3678
02:31:15.531 --> 02:31:18.110
<v Speaker 2>the hair gets thicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their tusks role grow longer.</v>

3679
02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if like when a</v>

3680
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.370
<v Speaker 4>woman really believes in Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if she really believed in God,</v>

3681
02:31:23.610 --> 02:31:28.500
<v Speaker 4>her pussy would just tighten down like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fist and you would realize it when you,</v>

3682
02:31:28.501 --> 02:31:29.430
<v Speaker 4>when you were fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

3683
02:31:29.431 --> 02:31:30.690
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lord is inside of her.</v>

3684
02:31:30.691 --> 02:31:33.840
<v Speaker 4>This is a garage should come inside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that cause I should make babies with her</v>

3685
02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:35.630
<v Speaker 4>because the Lord is inherent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She really,</v>

3686
02:31:35.790 --> 02:31:39.010
<v Speaker 4>when the Lord Lord resides within this </v>
<v Speaker 4>con man,</v>

3687
02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:41.190
<v Speaker 4>we could maybe you could tell by having </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex with them.</v>

3688
02:31:41.290 --> 02:31:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that and the guys would cry.</v>

3689
02:31:44.210 --> 02:31:45.830
<v Speaker 7>Bill grew,</v>
<v Speaker 7>believed in the Lord,</v>

3690
02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:49.140
<v Speaker 7>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>girl bereaved or girl I believe,</v>

3691
02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:51.470
<v Speaker 7>believed in the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was out outsource where I was like,</v>

3692
02:31:51.471 --> 02:31:53.420
<v Speaker 7>just take him out dick and a bucket of </v>
<v Speaker 7>Jello.</v>

3693
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:56.240
<v Speaker 7>There was enough and there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no,</v>

3694
02:31:56.241 --> 02:31:57.350
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no hope.</v>

3695
02:31:57.440 --> 02:31:58.340
<v Speaker 7>There's no future.</v>

3696
02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:01.930
<v Speaker 4>And there's this guy holding his wife's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>

3697
02:32:01.931 --> 02:32:02.764
<v Speaker 4>like a death grip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got this Christian smile and her </v>

3698
02:32:04.811 --> 02:32:06.220
<v Speaker 4>eyes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our pussies,</v>

3699
02:32:06.221 --> 02:32:09.340
<v Speaker 4>a vice grip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just up ball Milkin,</v>

3700
02:32:09.341 --> 02:32:13.090
<v Speaker 4>vice grip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>industrial suction power,</v>

3701
02:32:16.700 --> 02:32:20.100
<v Speaker 4>clamp down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine</v>

3702
02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:24.410
<v Speaker 4>there's already a lot more Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3703
02:32:24.430 --> 02:32:25.263
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be something that would be </v>

3704
02:32:26.271 --> 02:32:27.104
<v Speaker 4>something that would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would definitely get people on the side </v>

3705
02:32:28.371 --> 02:32:29.204
<v Speaker 4>of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the weird things about </v>

3706
02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is only the more radical sex of it.</v>

3707
02:32:34.221 --> 02:32:35.054
<v Speaker 4>And the more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deeper that people get into it when </v>

3708
02:32:37.221 --> 02:32:41.180
<v Speaker 4>they want to cover up the entire woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cover everything came and see her,</v>

3709
02:32:41.390 --> 02:32:43.130
<v Speaker 4>can't even see her when she goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cover it up.</v>

3710
02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:46.160
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is like if you don't cover up,</v>

3711
02:32:46.161 --> 02:32:46.994
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men are just going to be like totally </v>

3712
02:32:48.081 --> 02:32:49.040
<v Speaker 4>rape crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3713
02:32:49.041 --> 02:32:50.570
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they must,</v>

3714
02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:54.230
<v Speaker 4>they must really like the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3715
02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3716
02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:56.421
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3717
02:32:56.421 --> 02:32:56.960
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3718
02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

3719
02:32:58.250 --> 02:33:00.200
<v Speaker 4>how true statistically it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3720
02:33:00.201 --> 02:33:01.034
<v Speaker 4>they say that like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rape is a big problem when they go </v>

3721
02:33:02.871 --> 02:33:05.210
<v Speaker 4>to these western countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these refugees and shit.</v>

3722
02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh they're probably not used to seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these little short,</v>

3723
02:33:07.401 --> 02:33:09.530
<v Speaker 4>short like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a fucking buffet,</v>

3724
02:33:09.531 --> 02:33:10.364
<v Speaker 4>a pussy around here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think that any country that </v>

3725
02:33:13.731 --> 02:33:14.564
<v Speaker 4>has been around for as long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like any part of the world really we're </v>

3726
02:33:17.301 --> 02:33:19.940
<v Speaker 4>civilization has existed in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long,</v>

3727
02:33:19.941 --> 02:33:20.930
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

3728
02:33:21.170 --> 02:33:23.720
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to get those people </v>
<v Speaker 4>off their old ways.</v>

3729
02:33:24.170 --> 02:33:25.003
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you're dealing with a place </v>

3730
02:33:26.361 --> 02:33:29.830
<v Speaker 4>like the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq is the oldest with,</v>

3731
02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.033
<v Speaker 4>they think that like sue mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is where our rack is as far as we </v>

3732
02:33:33.861 --> 02:33:34.694
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the oldest civilization we're </v>

3733
02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:37.970
<v Speaker 4>currently totally aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3734
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:42.350
<v Speaker 4>6,000 years ago there was people living </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there and they had mathematics.</v>

3735
02:33:42.351 --> 02:33:43.184
<v Speaker 4>They had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculture has really advanced </v>

3736
02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:49.130
<v Speaker 4>civilization for the time and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that are there today in a lot</v>

3737
02:33:49.131 --> 02:33:49.964
<v Speaker 4>of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's people who have come in </v>

3738
02:33:50.601 --> 02:33:51.434
<v Speaker 4>and people have left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of the fucking energy and the </v>

3739
02:33:53.811 --> 02:33:54.644
<v Speaker 4>ideas that culture are still in some way</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to this 6,000 year old </v>

3740
02:33:59.601 --> 02:34:02.210
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're still kinda fucked in this country</v>

3741
02:34:02.211 --> 02:34:03.044
<v Speaker 4>cause we're connected to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the puritans were connected to the </v>

3742
02:34:04.731 --> 02:34:05.564
<v Speaker 4>pilgrims that landed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all these people that came over </v>

3743
02:34:07.551 --> 02:34:08.384
<v Speaker 4>here seeking religious freedom and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were super religious and super </v>

3744
02:34:11.451 --> 02:34:12.284
<v Speaker 4>puritanical and their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember it wasn't just the puritans </v>

3745
02:34:14.530 --> 02:34:15.291
<v Speaker 4>were saying it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3746
02:34:15.291 --> 02:34:17.620
<v Speaker 4>it was kinda like the puritans were </v>
<v Speaker 4>sent.</v>

3747
02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:18.110
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

3748
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.943
<v Speaker 1>the puritans came here to escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious persecution and then a lot of </v>

3749
02:34:20.681 --> 02:34:22.600
<v Speaker 1>the dregs of their society were sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3750
02:34:22.601 --> 02:34:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

3751
02:34:23.681 --> 02:34:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

3752
02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:28.330
<v Speaker 1>go colonize the new world forum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new life for yourself there.</v>

3753
02:34:28.390 --> 02:34:29.770
<v Speaker 1>That's my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3754
02:34:29.771 --> 02:34:30.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying like,</v>

3755
02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but if you really look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the flip side.</v>

3756
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:33.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of even look at America </v>

3757
02:34:34.421 --> 02:34:35.890
<v Speaker 1>today and still see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3758
02:34:35.891 --> 02:34:36.724
<v Speaker 1>here's the pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where the puritan element comes </v>

3759
02:34:37.991 --> 02:34:40.630
<v Speaker 1>in and here's where the degenerate scum </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck element comes in,</v>

3760
02:34:40.631 --> 02:34:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you got America,</v>

3761
02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:42.670
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3762
02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:45.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a look.</v>

3763
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:46.383
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you start a fresh country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a God damn gamble and a bunch of </v>

3764
02:34:49.271 --> 02:34:51.730
<v Speaker 4>people are going to come over here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get the best stuff.</v>

3765
02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:52.773
<v Speaker 4>But look at Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia was started as a prison </v>

3766
02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:56.350
<v Speaker 4>colony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of my favorite places to visit.</v>

3767
02:34:56.351 --> 02:34:58.120
<v Speaker 4>The people were fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never been there.</v>

3768
02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:59.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd love it.</v>

3769
02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Fucking Melbourne is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

3770
02:35:02.561 --> 02:35:03.940
<v Speaker 4>One of the best cities I've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

3771
02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:06.880
<v Speaker 4>The people are so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

3772
02:35:06.881 --> 02:35:10.870
<v Speaker 4>it's like a cool San Francisco type vibe</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a weird accent.</v>

3773
02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:14.710
<v Speaker 4>Not Weird to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking nicest people in the world.</v>

3774
02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:15.573
<v Speaker 4>There's so few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have it so much better over there </v>

3775
02:35:18.130 --> 02:35:18.963
<v Speaker 4>because there's as many as there is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the La area and their entire fucking </v>

3776
02:35:23.351 --> 02:35:26.650
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

3777
02:35:27.010 --> 02:35:28.930
<v Speaker 4>What I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of fucking people,</v>

3778
02:35:28.931 --> 02:35:29.770
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh you just like,</v>

3779
02:35:29.771 --> 02:35:31.330

<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3780
02:35:31.331 --> 02:35:32.380
<v Speaker 4>cause I'm thinking about that,</v>

3781
02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:34.690
<v Speaker 1>like how ridiculously overpopulated we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

3782
02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:35.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second I land in La like you go </v>

3783
02:35:38.711 --> 02:35:41.110
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a weird vibe instantly.</v>

3784
02:35:41.111 --> 02:35:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I just feel like way more guarded </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and stuff cause I,</v>

3785
02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:46.153
<v Speaker 1>there's like a sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a faint whiff of like violence </v>

3786
02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:54.190
<v Speaker 1>that's always in the air here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just feel like the tensions that</v>

3787
02:35:54.191 --> 02:35:56.320
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I noticed people are like,</v>

3788
02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:57.213
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people aren't here a super </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologetic all the time for like the </v>

3789
02:35:59.321 --> 02:36:00.154
<v Speaker 1>slightest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's just cause they all </v>

3790
02:36:00.911 --> 02:36:01.744
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like kind of a powder keg </v>

3791
02:36:03.311 --> 02:36:07.720
<v Speaker 1>here that could just explode at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they're just polite.</v>

3792
02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:09.153
<v Speaker 1>They're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are people that are super </v>

3793
02:36:10.151 --> 02:36:12.300
<v Speaker 1>apologetic about what look like I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went,</v>

3794
02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:15.130
<v Speaker 1>first thing happened to me when I walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the airport was this guy,</v>

3795
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:16.593
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing a suitcase and he hits my </v>

3796
02:36:18.011 --> 02:36:20.230
<v Speaker 1>foot with it and he says he's sorry.</v>

3797
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:21.400
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm so sorry.</v>

3798
02:36:21.430 --> 02:36:23.920
<v Speaker 1>But he keeps pulling it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3799
02:36:23.921 --> 02:36:26.020
<v Speaker 1>so he's not really changing what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

3800
02:36:26.050 --> 02:36:30.640
<v Speaker 1>He's just given me an apology for it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't get mad about it basically.</v>

3801
02:36:30.850 --> 02:36:31.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

3802
02:36:31.301 --> 02:36:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't stop what he's doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>readjust and try to not hit your foot?</v>

3803
02:36:34.570 --> 02:36:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just got out of the way at that</v>

3804
02:36:36.251 --> 02:36:37.084
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3805
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.751
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3806
02:36:37.751 --> 02:36:39.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people around here,</v>

3807
02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:41.050
<v Speaker 1>they almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to like,</v>

3808
02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:41.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diffused a sorry over things to diffuse </v>

3809
02:36:43.721 --> 02:36:45.670
<v Speaker 1>any possible like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if I say sorry,</v>

3810
02:36:45.671 --> 02:36:46.504
<v Speaker 1>then people won't be as pissed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's kind of stepping on each </v>

3811
02:36:49.061 --> 02:36:50.590
<v Speaker 1>other's toes here because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowded.</v>

3812
02:36:50.591 --> 02:36:51.424
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different cultures </v>

3813
02:36:53.621 --> 02:36:55.000
<v Speaker 1>trying to coexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3814
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:56.920
<v Speaker 1>in one place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even,</v>

3815
02:36:57.850 --> 02:36:59.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Seattle and shit,</v>

3816
02:36:59.261 --> 02:37:02.740
<v Speaker 1>like the area I live in has got like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of Asians there and stuff,</v>

3817
02:37:02.741 --> 02:37:07.741
<v Speaker 1>but like you don't really feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of like the clash going on or like</v>

3818
02:37:08.111 --> 02:37:08.944
<v Speaker 1>there's tensions between these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of people because the attitude </v>

3819
02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:13.510
<v Speaker 1>that they have like in the northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3820
02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 1>at least the parts of it I live in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of like,</v>

3821
02:37:16.430 --> 02:37:18.230
<v Speaker 4>people just can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't give a shit about each other.</v>

3822
02:37:18.890 --> 02:37:20.870
<v Speaker 4>And there's sort of like an air of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>detached,</v>

3823
02:37:20.871 --> 02:37:21.351
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3824
02:37:21.351 --> 02:37:23.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be somewhat friendly and shit,</v>

3825
02:37:23.841 --> 02:37:24.674
<v Speaker 4>but we're not all going to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to exchange all these </v>

3826
02:37:27.651 --> 02:37:28.484
<v Speaker 4>niceties and shit in his very brusque </v>
<v Speaker 4>attitude and people are to speak the </v>

3827
02:37:31.641 --> 02:37:33.200
<v Speaker 4>entire area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3828
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:36.590
<v Speaker 4>You view this spokesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am their spokesperson in Seattle to be</v>

3829
02:37:36.591 --> 02:37:37.700
<v Speaker 4>very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3830
02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't live exactly in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe you're in the area where people</v>

3831
02:37:40.371 --> 02:37:42.050
<v Speaker 4>go to escape the friendliness of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Seattle,</v>

3832
02:37:42.051 --> 02:37:42.884
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

3833
02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3834
02:37:44.631 --> 02:37:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3835
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.891
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

3836
02:37:45.891 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of Asians there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tend to be brusque.</v>

3837
02:37:47.571 --> 02:37:49.970
<v Speaker 4>I feel like racism here comes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3838
02:37:50.390 --> 02:37:52.920
<v Speaker 4>Especially against Eskimos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't fucking put up with that in you.</v>

3839
02:37:52.930 --> 02:37:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Which shit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3840
02:37:54.850 --> 02:37:56.420
<v Speaker 4>I'd like Pacific northwest.</v>

3841
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:57.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3842
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:58.783
<v Speaker 4>there's a neat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unique connection with nature when you </v>

3843
02:38:00.231 --> 02:38:02.720
<v Speaker 4>get rained on all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's green is fuck.</v>

3844
02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:03.613
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you guys have a better </v>

3845
02:38:04.221 --> 02:38:05.740
<v Speaker 4>connection with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like A,</v>

3846
02:38:05.741 --> 02:38:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I have some friends that live in Ballard</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we went to,</v>

3847
02:38:08.661 --> 02:38:10.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a park over there,</v>

3848
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:11.623
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they have kids that are my kids' </v>

3849
02:38:13.071 --> 02:38:13.904
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all went to the park and we were </v>

3850
02:38:14.571 --> 02:38:16.790
<v Speaker 4>hanging out there and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

3851
02:38:16.791 --> 02:38:18.740
<v Speaker 4>everything is so green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3852
02:38:18.741 --> 02:38:21.140
<v Speaker 4>you guys are not just used to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is like normal for you.</v>

3853
02:38:21.141 --> 02:38:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3854
02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:22.351
<v Speaker 4>And we will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3855
02:38:22.351 --> 02:38:23.184
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was a rare day where it was like </v>

3856
02:38:24.501 --> 02:38:26.330
<v Speaker 4>super sunny and warm and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3857
02:38:26.331 --> 02:38:27.164
<v Speaker 4>if this was like this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know this place would be so </v>

3858
02:38:29.961 --> 02:38:31.070
<v Speaker 4>fucking crowded?</v>

3859
02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:32.293
<v Speaker 4>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your relationship that you have with </v>

3860
02:38:33.891 --> 02:38:38.150
<v Speaker 4>nature is what keeps people away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it also enhances,</v>

3861
02:38:38.210 --> 02:38:39.043
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way the people that live there look </v>

3862
02:38:40.551 --> 02:38:42.200
<v Speaker 4>at things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're more grounded.</v>

3863
02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:43.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

3864
02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really one who like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3865
02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:48.380
<v Speaker 4>focuses a lot on like the physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>beauty of an area.</v>

3866
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:53.410
<v Speaker 4>But like I love just driving through </v>
<v Speaker 4>like over a bridge or something in,</v>

3867
02:38:54.921 --> 02:38:55.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3868
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:56.383
<v Speaker 4>in the Seattle area and just seeing all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking hills and all the entries </v>

3869
02:38:59.961 --> 02:39:03.710
<v Speaker 4>and all the water and everything just </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks really like serene and picturesque</v>

3870
02:39:03.711 --> 02:39:06.560
<v Speaker 4>and beautiful even though you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a shit ton of people there.</v>

3871
02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant potluck,</v>

3872
02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:11.420
<v Speaker 4>but like in la it's like there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sun and everything,</v>

3873
02:39:11.421 --> 02:39:13.250
<v Speaker 4>but you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just looks like a fucking,</v>

3874
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:14.463
<v Speaker 4>when you fly in la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just like a big grid of fucking </v>

3875
02:39:16.431 --> 02:39:17.750
<v Speaker 4>lights and shit.</v>

3876
02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:21.890
<v Speaker 4>There's not much of a of nature left for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to be like,</v>

3877
02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:24.590
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is a flat patch of desert.</v>

3878
02:39:24.890 --> 02:39:26.900
<v Speaker 4>They slapped all these stupid buildings </v>
<v Speaker 4>up on.</v>

3879
02:39:26.901 --> 02:39:27.734
<v Speaker 4>If it wasn't for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like chaparral and fucking </v>

3880
02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:31.363
<v Speaker 4>tumbleweeds and dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what Seattle also has is you guys </v>

3881
02:39:34.581 --> 02:39:37.950
<v Speaker 4>have the ocean and the mountains all </v>
<v Speaker 4>just jammed up on top of you too.</v>

3882
02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 4>Like you can get to mount rainier from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Seattle and what is it like 70 minutes,</v>

3883
02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:44.510
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might be a little longer,</v>

3884
02:39:44.511 --> 02:39:47.180
<v Speaker 4>but maybe an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two hours at the most because we were,</v>

3885
02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:50.000
<v Speaker 4>we were up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot squash and we were squashing me</v>

3886
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:52.490
<v Speaker 4>and Duncan trussell and we drove down </v>
<v Speaker 4>from there,</v>

3887
02:39:52.491 --> 02:39:55.110
<v Speaker 4>from Mount Rainier to a hotel in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3888
02:39:55.130 --> 02:39:55.963
<v Speaker 4>in the mainland and the regular area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was close enough that like within </v>

3889
02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:00.373
<v Speaker 4>two hours or whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could be in the middle of this </v>

3890
02:40:01.821 --> 02:40:04.790
<v Speaker 4>incredible rain forest and then go right</v>
<v Speaker 4>back down then.</v>

3891
02:40:04.791 --> 02:40:06.590
<v Speaker 4>And you're looking at the ocean right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>

3892
02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:10.310
<v Speaker 4>It's just so fucking vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at it,</v>

3893
02:40:10.330 --> 02:40:12.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3894
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm in the middle of</v>

3895
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the fucking woods are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can drive five minutes and be in,</v>

3896
02:40:18.801 --> 02:40:20.870
<v Speaker 2>in the downtown area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3897
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:22.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3898
02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:23.580
<v Speaker 2>it is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really get that.</v>

3899
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:24.473
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3900
02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:25.260
<v Speaker 2>in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3901
02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And you have a good amount of people up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>

3902
02:40:27.091 --> 02:40:27.924
<v Speaker 2>Like what is Seattle's population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 5 million or something of the </v>

3903
02:40:30.571 --> 02:40:32.820
<v Speaker 2>entire metropolitan area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

3904
02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I know off hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but find out what it is.</v>

3905
02:40:34.651 --> 02:40:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Young Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess it's like 5 million,</v>

3906
02:40:37.021 --> 02:40:37.854
<v Speaker 2>which I think you should put a cap on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let anybody move to me will die </v>

3907
02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:41.910
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even when I moved there,</v>

3908
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.000
<v Speaker 2>less than 5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many city says it's only 650,000 you</v>

3909
02:40:47.731 --> 02:40:50.040
<v Speaker 2>got to look at the Seattle metropolitan </v>
<v Speaker 2>area though.</v>

3910
02:40:50.430 --> 02:40:53.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a good number though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>650,000 that's beautiful.</v>

3911
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.903
<v Speaker 2>But even when I moved there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I told people just went 7 </v>

3912
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:58.650
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>703.7 so that ain't shit.</v>

3913
02:40:58.740 --> 02:40:59.580
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3914
02:40:59.581 --> 02:41:00.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like even when I moved there,</v>

3915
02:41:00.991 --> 02:41:04.770
<v Speaker 2>like people are already kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could sense like people being like,</v>

3916
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:05.633
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people and people always do that </v>

3917
02:41:08.611 --> 02:41:09.150
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3918
02:41:09.150 --> 02:41:09.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3919
02:41:09.601 --> 02:41:10.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

3920
02:41:11.490 --> 02:41:12.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3921
02:41:12.481 --> 02:41:14.880

3936
02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six or seven.</v>

3937
02:41:44.970 --> 02:41:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I can make that happen.</v>

3938
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:46.583
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

3939
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:48.570

3940
02:41:48.571 --> 02:41:50.520
<v Speaker 2>portland to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3941
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.863
<v Speaker 2>there's a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a handful of places that I </v>

3942
02:41:52.861 --> 02:41:56.260
<v Speaker 2>would live outside of La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seattle,</v>

3943
02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Seattle for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland for sure.</v>

3944
02:41:58.980 --> 02:42:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>

3945
02:42:00.121 --> 02:42:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it would get weird.</v>

3946
02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I get weird after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else would get like,</v>

3947
02:42:04.651 --> 02:42:05.790
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could do it,</v>

3948
02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:08.670
<v Speaker 2>but outside of Denver or boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say Denver,</v>

3949
02:42:08.671 --> 02:42:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

3950
02:42:09.631 --> 02:42:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I could live in aspen too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

3951
02:42:11.290 --> 02:42:12.123
<v Speaker 2>I love when I was trying to escape Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we all sat down and we were trying </v>

3952
02:42:14.791 --> 02:42:15.624
<v Speaker 2>to all come to a consensus about where </v>
<v Speaker 2>to move to and like a lot of those </v>

3953
02:42:17.911 --> 02:42:20.910
<v Speaker 2>places were considered like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were tossing around Austin,</v>

3954
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:22.063
<v Speaker 2>we were tossing around La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were tossing around Portland and </v>

3955
02:42:24.241 --> 02:42:25.074
<v Speaker 2>we're tossing around Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of pretty similar places </v>

3956
02:42:27.571 --> 02:42:28.404
<v Speaker 2>where we would live.</v>

3957
02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Those are the only places cause I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>not happy living in Columbus,</v>

3958
02:42:31.381 --> 02:42:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3959
02:42:32.521 --> 02:42:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of great people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbus.</v>

3960
02:42:35.701 --> 02:42:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that winter can suck my dick.</v>

3961
02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:39.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3962
02:42:39.541 --> 02:42:41.220

02:42:58.320 --> 02:42:59.640
<v Speaker 2>It's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're deep into March.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it like the 16th or something </v>

3973
02:43:02.430 --> 02:43:05.610
<v Speaker 2>15th Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't be snowing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too late.</v>

3975
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:09.270
<v Speaker 2>It's no more snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

02:43:09.271 --> 02:43:09.991
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

02:43:09.991 --> 02:43:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not allowed to snow anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

3978
02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:13.420
<v Speaker 2>You get jammed in there for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

3979
02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:14.253
<v Speaker 2>But even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think New York is a weird </v>

3980
02:43:16.121 --> 02:43:19.450
<v Speaker 2>combination of weather and extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

3981
02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I think when you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there could be,</v>

3982
02:43:22.661 --> 02:43:23.494
<v Speaker 2>there's good things like what Seattle </v>
<v Speaker 2>has is like a good amount of whether </v>

3983
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:26.554
<v Speaker 2>like it gets rain but it only snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a couple of days a year if </v>

3984
02:43:29.831 --> 02:43:30.664
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it only gets below actually a </v>

3985
02:43:32.141 --> 02:43:35.270
<v Speaker 2>pretty weirdly heavy snow storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3987
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:37.350

<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3988
02:43:37.390 --> 02:43:40.150
<v Speaker 2>that was very unusual for the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3989
02:43:40.151 --> 02:43:40.990
<v Speaker 2>like spring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the winter,</v>

3990
02:43:40.991 --> 02:43:43.810

<v Speaker 2>dreary,</v>

3991
02:43:43.811 --> 02:43:45.460
<v Speaker 2>rainy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>exact.</v>

4016
02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Homedale and they did just have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commute every day for an hour,</v>

4017
02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:42.153
<v Speaker 2>which if you see it in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove up there once real early in the </v>

4018
02:44:44.861 --> 02:44:48.370
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving up towards Bakersfield and</v>

4019
02:44:48.371 --> 02:44:49.810
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

4020
02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:50.673
<v Speaker 2>I want to say like before dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was about five 30 in the morning </v>

4021
02:44:53.740 --> 02:44:58.740
<v Speaker 2>and the amount of people coming towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>la from way past bakersfield was fucking</v>

4022
02:44:59.471 --> 02:45:01.780
<v Speaker 2>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like stunning.</v>

4023
02:45:01.781 --> 02:45:02.614
<v Speaker 2>Like I really had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's people that can't afford </v>

4024
02:45:04.751 --> 02:45:05.584
<v Speaker 2>housing in La and so they commute and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they commute and they have to get up </v>

4025
02:45:08.651 --> 02:45:09.484
<v Speaker 2>really early in the morning to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because at five 30 in the fucking </v>

4026
02:45:11.891 --> 02:45:12.724
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bumper to bumper traffic on the </v>

4027
02:45:14.861 --> 02:45:16.360
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts,</v>

4028
02:45:16.361 --> 02:45:16.931
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

4029
02:45:16.931 --> 02:45:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I ain't never seen anything like it when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4030
02:45:18.911 --> 02:45:19.321
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4031
02:45:19.321 --> 02:45:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

4032
02:45:20.651 --> 02:45:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Like this is something that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even realize was an issue.</v>

4033
02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:23.673
<v Speaker 2>All those people that can't afford to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in La and they drive down and it's </v>

4034
02:45:26.181 --> 02:45:27.014
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fucking people that live out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and drive down here for work a </v>

4035
02:45:30.881 --> 02:45:32.650
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should just build it.</v>

4036
02:45:32.651 --> 02:45:34.990
<v Speaker 2>They should put in some high speed rail </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just fucking with it,</v>

4037
02:45:34.991 --> 02:45:38.700
<v Speaker 2>talking about doing more affordable </v>
<v Speaker 2>housing along the way for people to just</v>

4038
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:42.310
<v Speaker 2>establish these artificial communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of resistance to that.</v>

4039
02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:45.280
<v Speaker 2>People that live in that area don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas developed.</v>

4040
02:45:45.930 --> 02:45:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're developers.</v>

4041
02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Now we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we're talking to Melvin,</v>

4042
02:45:50.470 --> 02:45:52.270
<v Speaker 2>we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talk about Jesus.</v>

4043
02:45:52.271 --> 02:45:54.340
<v Speaker 2>We talked about bossy and we talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about waffles.</v>

4044
02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Does anything we should talk about land </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

4045
02:45:57.370 --> 02:45:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should take back what we said today.</v>

4046
02:45:59.410 --> 02:46:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel bad.</v>

4047
02:46:00.281 --> 02:46:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel pretty good.</v>

4048
02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I feel pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good about it.</v>

4049
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:04.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like there's anything that </v>

4050
02:46:05.471 --> 02:46:07.750
<v Speaker 2>was said that needs to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4051
02:46:07.751 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 2>we better revoke that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People take it</v>

4052
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.590
<v Speaker 4>the wrong way or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You definitely are going to fuck them.</v>

4053
02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:14.330
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing you can do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
