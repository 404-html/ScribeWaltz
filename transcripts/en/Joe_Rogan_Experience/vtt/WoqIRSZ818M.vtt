<v Speaker 1>Like you can't teach being a good</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I got a wonder what it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 years from now.</v>

120
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be insane.</v>

121
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then hopefully they'll have hover</v>

122
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>cars that knock each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

123
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about that yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watched some clips from blade runner,</v>

124
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 2>the movie that was supposed to be 2019,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's the only supposed to be two</v>

125
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that crazy didn't realize that</v>

126
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Harrison Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daryl Hannah,</v>

128
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rutger hauer great movie.</v>

129
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite all time Scifi</v>

130
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

131
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>hard to believe that that was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be just a couple of years from now.</v>

132
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Like people really overestimated the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of technology we'd have by then.</v>

133
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

134
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they overestimated that,</v>

135
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Speaker 2>but in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things they underestimated the</v>

136
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

137
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

138
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 2>when I first said 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two things to get involved in,</v>

139
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 2>we're healthcare and telecommunications</v>
<v Speaker 2>with morphed into the Internet.</v>

140
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what the Internet was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

141
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 2>people measure rotates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>returns on their investment and return</v>

143
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>on the minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not returned on the hour or the month or</v>

144
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>return on capital because things can</v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

145
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a few seconds.</v>

146
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 2>But how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

147
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>but how do you feel about that of a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been an investor for as long as</v>

148
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you've been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

149
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about this new thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're using computers and</v>

150
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 2>algorithms to buy and trade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally at the speed of sound and</v>

151
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:40.921
<v Speaker 2>just click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

152
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>click going back and forth depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trends and they,</v>

153
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're paying money to get a server</v>

154
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>that's as close as possible to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange so that they're living and they</v>

155
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 2>were literally buying and selling in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds or a millionth of a second</v>

156
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 2>ahead of everybody else because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to the exchange.</v>

157
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I came up the old way.</v>

158
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progress,</v>

160
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like it because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't understand it.</v>

161
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And like I was tweeting this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gold's down,</v>

162
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil broke a $48 a barrel or $49 a barrel</v>

163
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and a how was your 401k improved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your gurus telling you to do</v>

164
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The market's up.</v>

165
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending how you want to measure 20,</v>

166
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>25%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since trump got elected on the 8th of</v>

167
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hardly anybody has benefited the</v>

168
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>guys that had benefited of the guys who</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive the indices a,</v>

169
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>he's created 3 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$3 trillion if she's me in market cap on</v>

170
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the just the New York Stock Exchange.</v>

171
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people haven't benefited</v>

172
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>because 70 to 90%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you want to count a or</v>

173
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>calculate a of that money is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

174
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 1>rockefeller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pena,</v>

175
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

176
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And so the average guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average joe didn't benefit.</v>

177
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ask anybody listening,</v>

178
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>check your 401k or your pension plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me how much it's up since November</v>

179
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>8th most people say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

180
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a part of that is just what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were alluding to the algorithms,</v>

181
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>because it's the f fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big money that's making all the big</v>

182
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although a hedge funds have fallen out</v>

183
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>of favor the last couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their returns haven't been the</v>

184
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>same as even the indices.</v>

185
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.270
<v Speaker 3>So your feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about the things that</v>

186
00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.610
<v Speaker 3>trump is doing right now and the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

187
00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:24.730
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's bringing on all these guys that</v>

189
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 3>have worked for these major corporations</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Exxon and he's,</v>

190
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.970
<v Speaker 3>they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing that he announced the</v>

191
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.120
<v Speaker 3>other day of creating 45,000 jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go in the golf coast.</v>

192
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.580
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it,</v>

193
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a thing on the New York Times</v>

194
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was talking about,</v>

195
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:42.160
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was time magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was talking about he's created</v>

196
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>239,000 jobs since he's been in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

197
00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:47.471
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it,</v>

198
00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:49.060
<v Speaker 3>a couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that long.</v>

199
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.540
<v Speaker 3>And so are you from a business</v>
<v Speaker 3>standpoint,</v>

200
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.010
<v Speaker 3>forget about like socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

201
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:54.900
<v Speaker 3>let flint business sandpoint claimer</v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

202
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 3>I know trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

203
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.090
<v Speaker 3>And I knew them from that late eighties</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

204
00:07:58.091 --> 00:07:59.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the early nineties,</v>

205
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 3>because one of my partners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of my mentors was governor Hugh</v>

206
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Carey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the former governor in New York.</v>

207
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 3>So because of his New York relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also one of my,</v>

208
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ex business partners with Mayor Wagner,</v>

209
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:10.510
<v Speaker 3>the former mayor of New York.</v>

210
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.570
<v Speaker 1>So I knew trump then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

211
00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:14.790
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't talked to him in over 20</v>

212
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But getting back to your original</v>

213
00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:18.120
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

214
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.103
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I believe that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

216
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why he's meeting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ceos of all these major</v>

217
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 1>industries because nobody else has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

218
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in,</v>

219
00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:32.030
<v Speaker 1>as I endorsed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the early endorser's flip</v>

220
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.300
<v Speaker 1>trump and I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

221
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.940
<v Speaker 1>if he's serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'll win,</v>

222
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know how to lose.</v>

223
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.190
<v Speaker 1>If he's serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to rock the fucking planet,</v>

224
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.380
<v Speaker 1>not just the u s but the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the financial models are changing in</v>

225
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

226
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.580
<v Speaker 1>not just because of brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The financial models are trainging,</v>

227
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia,</v>

228
00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>the models are changing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

229
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:01.521
<v Speaker 1>in China because they've got a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an Alpha male in the office that</v>

230
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>has surrounded himself with Alpha males.</v>

231
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence at 60% of his staff</v>
<v Speaker 1>are ex military.</v>

232
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press secretary is that God damn</v>

233
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant Commander in the Navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>not counting all the four star generals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's got.</v>

236
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't agree with everything he</v>

237
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with everything he tweets.</v>

238
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't tweet as many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as he does,</v>

239
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but I do agree that the country needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change financial change and he's</v>

240
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>going to bring it now whether he gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>elected a second term or not,</v>

241
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe,</v>

242
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>and I've said Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is the November the eighth was</v>

243
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of wealth the planet has</v>

244
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>ever fucking seen since World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

245
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

246
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>just look at $3 trillion so far in stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

247
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's going to be $100</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>

248
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 1>He's going to add to the market before</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to his office.</v>

249
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.610
<v Speaker 1>He's explained to a dummy like me dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

250
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.583
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

251
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 1>A Caterpillar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they got in some trouble for</v>

252
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got raided a,</v>

253
00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>here are a couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean not a seller?</v>

254
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:01.420
<v Speaker 1>What are the caterpillar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make tractors.</v>

255
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The infrastructure shot in this country.</v>

256
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

257
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>the bridges are all 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

258
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 1>60 years past their prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

259
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know a bridge could go past its</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime.</v>

260
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roads are 50,</v>

261
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years past their prime.</v>

262
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infrastructure for pipelines are</v>

263
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>past their prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's going to rebuild all this.</v>

264
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna spend supposedly a $3</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion,</v>

265
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a coincidence that because</v>

266
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>he added 3 trillion to the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to add infrastructure.</v>

267
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:32.890
<v Speaker 1>So all the stocks like Caterpillar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

268
00:10:32.891 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and t,</v>

269
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boeing,</v>

270
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.410
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

271
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone up 15,</v>

272
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:37.921
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25,</v>

273
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 1>30% since he got elected because the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

274
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 1>the smart money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>knows that those companies are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get all the contracts.</v>

276
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real no brainer is aerospace,</v>

277
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.680
<v Speaker 1>aerospace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because he cut the cost of a</v>

278
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 1>air force one down 700 million or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he did,</v>

279
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.680
<v Speaker 1>but because he's going to bring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States military back to what it</v>

280
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>was under Reagan 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

281
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.080
<v Speaker 1>and being a vet myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe a strong country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

283
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I think we get involved in too much shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the country.</v>

284
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean a strong country then</v>

285
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:10.970
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>screw with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to bring back jobs.</v>

287
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he will build a wall.</v>

288
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And My mother and grandmother's swam</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the Rio Grande River as illegal</v>

289
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>aliens in 1924.</v>
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>

290
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.371
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

291
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God rest her soul.</v>

292
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 1>We were just out at the cemetery a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago.</v>

293
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

294
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a naturalized citizen until</v>

295
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>she was in early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

296
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

297
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I figured out a way to pay for the</v>

298
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:37.430
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yours is the first show I'm going to</v>

299
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>say it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

300
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They arrested Guzman,</v>

301
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the great drug trafficker from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

302
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They also confiscated $39 billion from</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it really?</v>

303
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>He had heard the 9 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

304
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>39.</v>

305
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:54.380
<v Speaker 1>It's Hashtag podcast,</v>

306
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

307
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.253
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

308
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.360
<v Speaker 2>So why not pay for the wall with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>

309
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a good idea.</v>

310
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that a wall is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>feasible and it's a good idea to have</v>

311
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's feasible,</v>

312
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:06.844
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

313
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guide that I would rather pull the</v>

314
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 2>trigger and see if it works then not do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

315
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 2>The biggest difference between most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids that are out there trying to be</v>

316
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 2>successful like yourself and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people you've interviewed here is</v>

317
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 2>they spreadsheet at the death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They read books,</v>

318
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 2>they listen to podcast and they never do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking thing.</v>

319
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had kids come to my seminar that</v>

320
00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 2>ever read 700 books on personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

321
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know there was 700 bucks in</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal development.</v>

322
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they've never pulled the trigger</v>

323
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 2>paralysis by analysis.</v>

324
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

325
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:41.310
<v Speaker 2>That can definitely happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

326
00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It can definitely happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

327
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:43.220
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

328
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>like the kids yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all read books and I don't even</v>

329
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:48.080
<v Speaker 2>know what the charm books are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

330
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a program called the</v>

331
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 2>art of charm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the same thing,</v>

332
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 2>how to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what they call it,</v>

333
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a deal is exactly what it is.</v>

334
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at it and I've actually been</v>

335
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 2>interviewed on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the kid show.</v>

336
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me like saying something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

337
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get famous instead of like just</v>

<v Speaker 2>famous like how to get laid well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like a scene in a Zombie movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you thought this was the</v>

357
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:43.510

<v Speaker 2>you were in a competition and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked the guy cold in the first 10</v>

369
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:11.730
<v Speaker 2>seconds or two minutes or one minute.</v>

<v Speaker 2>were in,</v>

371
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 2>I think he was still a teenager maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

372
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:16.780

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

375
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

377
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

378

<v Speaker 2>well you don't.</v>

379
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to actually do it too.</v>

380
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.100
<v Speaker 2>You could read theory all you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but until you got theories,</v>

382
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.620
<v Speaker 2>one thing and thoughts were another</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

383
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 2>But actions are critical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about what happened</v>

384
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 2>during the actions and be prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

391
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.040

<v Speaker 3>It was a big deal for him to,</v>

424
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I really think he lost more than 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>

425
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.513
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty impressive.</v>

426
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago,</v>

427
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:16.030
<v Speaker 1>a 10 12 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just decided at 60 and I was going to</v>

428
00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:19.450
<v Speaker 1>become a power lifter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what possessed me.</v>

429
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So I gained 65 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took human growth hormones,</v>

430
00:16:23.711 --> 00:16:26.530
<v Speaker 1>they did the whole nine yards and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to two 80,</v>

431
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

432
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get the up to 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't get up to 300 pounds</v>

434
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.990
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried like hell.</v>

435
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean I eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat everything on this table,</v>

436
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.583
<v Speaker 1>metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and care.</v>

437
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized that and then,</v>

438
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:42.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also don't have the,</v>

439
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:43.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

440
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:45.310
<v Speaker 1>the right bone structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

441
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:46.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided that the,</v>

442
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:48.670
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things I can only do so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much weight.</v>

443
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.740
<v Speaker 1>So I was doing bench presses with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

444
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time he was a 28 and a,</v>

445
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.630
<v Speaker 1>we were doing sets and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

446
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I heard this rip in my bicep and I kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>working out.</v>

447
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 1>But what I had done is I ripped my long</v>
<v Speaker 1>head bicep.</v>

448
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

449
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons they call me the</v>

450
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.620
<v Speaker 1>bionic man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just had two knee full knee</v>

451
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:10.570

<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

455
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 2>two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

470
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

471
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:58.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

472
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 2>and my knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told me I had the second knee done.</v>

473
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I weighed at 10 weeks.</v>

474
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>But they were right and I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

475
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

476
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.590
<v Speaker 2>And you would be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

477
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when I get up from here,</v>

478
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you'll see how I get up gingerly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Wa like when they build you an</v>

479
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 2>artificial knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>

480
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did they chop off the top of your</v>

481
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 2>knee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screwed in place at the top and the</v>

482
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 2>bottom femur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they put like a joint like this</v>

483
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 2>and then it has these like spikes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into the bone marrow and they cement</v>

484
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Jews.</v>

485
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.760
<v Speaker 2>They didn't tell you tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

486
00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 2>see your knee goes like this moves both</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

487
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but my knees only go this way.</v>

488
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Goes up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to relearn how to put my socks</v>

489
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:40.251
<v Speaker 2>on because when you put your socks on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your leg swings over.</v>

490
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't swing your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

491
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a little sideways movement.</v>

492
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

493
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 2>That seems like it would be severely</v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting,</v>

494
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:47.911
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Well it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

496
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'll be when in martial</v>

497
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:54.340
<v Speaker 2>arts you say we're going to roll and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I,</v>

498
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you won't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't be rolling.</v>

499
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Now did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have ligament damage or meniscus</v>

500
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:01.500
<v Speaker 2>damage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had three surgeries on my right knee</v>

501
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the above.</v>

502
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 2>And I had one surgery on my left knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why they decided to replace the entire</v>

503
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 2>name cause I had no cartilage left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was bone on bone from running tens of</v>

504
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 2>thousands of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

505
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.760
<v Speaker 2>when I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

506
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>a biohack a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know what that meant.</v>

507
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Biohacking and I went to the bio hacking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the guys and I met a guy I</v>

508
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 2>really liked to seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there a guy named to Siena and uh,</v>

509
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.563
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

510
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things I've been doing since</v>

511
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 2>the 70s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran a hundred miles and piss blood,</v>

512
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 2>which used to be the benchmark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a man and a runner,</v>

513
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 2>you run a hundred miles and you piss</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

514
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's makes you man.</v>

515
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because yeah,</v>

516
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 2>that's what that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that then it did.</v>

517
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 2>And I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you breathe?</v>

518
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

519
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

520
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've run marathons and I run a lot,</v>

521
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot of miles and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my knees paid for it,</v>

522
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 2>so I haven't really been able to run in</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

523
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever looked at a stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy for it?</v>

524
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:54.901
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

525
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:58.620
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Mexico and a couple of</v>

526
00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

527
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I tried it 25 years ago when it first</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out in Switzerland.</v>

528
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.380
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

529
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I won't have to go to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

530
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

531
00:20:06.281 --> 00:20:06.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

532
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great place in Vegas,</v>

533
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.070
<v Speaker 2>you know that they're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it,</v>

534
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 2>but they've been able to regenerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>meniscus,</v>

535
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartilage,</v>

536
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

537
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a slow process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can be done now.</v>

538
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it seems like yours is gone</v>

539
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you like play tennis?</v>

540
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Can you move around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you go side to side?</v>

541
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I can go this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I strive to move this way.</v>

542
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't move out.</v>

543
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.990
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't tell why you're walking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

544
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.481
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

545
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

546
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>still great actress said many years.</v>

548
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 2>What's better?</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was married to Esther Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's wrong.</v>

552
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I think he's definitely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

553
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>you're better off feeling good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking good because if you look good</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you feel like Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in hell.</v>

555
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 1>But if you look like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you feel fantastic,</v>

556
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.350

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

559
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I think he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

560
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

563
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to the top of your femur</v>

<v Speaker 1>and the bottom of your femur saw dogs.</v>

565
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.173
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

566
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you kill a bear with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slowed it down with a handgun and then</v>

567
00:21:21.271 --> 00:21:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I killed it with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The knife was what was going on in the,</v>

568
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let me just say I have three</v>

569
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:30.050
<v Speaker 1>regrets in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

570
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.800
<v Speaker 1>it leads into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the segway,</v>

571
00:21:31.801 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it will become obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First regret is a,</v>

572
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

573
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 1>the day before my mom died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>

574
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you're not fucking sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fucking sick or you're not</v>

575
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She dies the next day.</v>

576
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second regret I have is the fact that,</v>

577
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a combat trained army officer who</v>

578
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 1>never saw combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Never gotten any real trigger time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third regret is that I didn't set my</v>

581
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 1>goals high enough is successful as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

582
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

583
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get involved with mercenary</v>

584
00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:01.240
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

585
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got out of the military about 10</v>

586
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:06.490
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I had done very well as far as</v>

587
00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 1>business was concerned.</v>

588
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

589
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:11.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

590
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I actually did a joint venture with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA.</v>

591
00:22:13.451 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's all public record now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the I statue of limitations passed</v>

592
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 1>so I can't get in any trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

593
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I decided to go do big game hunting.</v>

594
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 1>And see if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 1>so I started with the rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some guys do beaus I believe you</v>

596
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:30.650
<v Speaker 1>do a then I that was too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I did a hand gun,</v>

597
00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 1>hand gun handgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>

598
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:35.560
<v Speaker 1>four console used to be the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>handgun made 25,</v>

599
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:37.020
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hunted handgun.</v>

600
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta get pretty close handgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How close you get.</v>

601
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've been as close as you to what?</v>

602
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 1>To the charging buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

603
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A buffalo was charging to disclose.</v>

604
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.750
<v Speaker 1>And you shot him with a handgun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

605
00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I got run over by him.</v>

606
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

607
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get back to the bed,</v>

608
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.310
<v Speaker 1>but the handgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you try and get inside of 20</v>

609
00:22:57.311 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 1>yards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how close the chat?</v>

610
00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends how good a shot you are.</v>

611
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

612
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 1>they're effective at 50 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

613
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:05.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accuracy is not so good,</v>

614
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 1>but 20 yards is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 meters.</v>

615
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

616
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.783
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

617
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 1>so we're chasing this bear down right on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the borderline of Alaska and whatever</v>

618
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:16.630
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian provinces up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

619
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

620
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I get within about 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

621
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 1>50 yards of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

622
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he turns around because he says,</v>

623
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:23.450
<v Speaker 1>why am I running?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

624
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the asked him said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I running?</v>

625
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And he turns around and I hit him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple times with the four or five,</v>

626
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 1>four and now I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he runs again.</v>

627
00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I chased him some more and make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long story short.</v>

628
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 1>By the time I unloaded all five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they don't need five shells.</v>

629
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.381
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

630
00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>he's wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have died probably in an hour</v>

631
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.220
<v Speaker 1>or two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still dangerous.</v>

632
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.600
<v Speaker 1>So then I jumped on him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

633
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 1>stabbed 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 times.</v>

634
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan 70 or 80 times,</v>

635
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline's pumping.</v>

636
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>So it was so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

637
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 1>the Hunter Guide said my arm looked like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

638
00:23:56.991 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jackhammer.</v>

639
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It was going up and down so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

640
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:00.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

641
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just jacked up.</v>

642
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And where he stabbed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stabbed him in the chest,</v>

643
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 1>around the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neck in here.</v>

644
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to hit a main artery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

645
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 1>he trying to bite you on the big claws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 1>but I'm staying under the closet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's losing coordination.</v>

647
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 1>He could've gotten me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>

648
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

649
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>

650
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a brown bear or a black bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>brown.</v>

651
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.920
<v Speaker 1>But the better story is the Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

652
00:24:26.921 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Suzie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get a better story than you?</v>

653
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Maniacally homocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nickel homicidally homicidally stabbing</v>

654
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:36.090
<v Speaker 1>a brown bear to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

655
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I went to the La Australia there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw the movie Crocodile Dundee?</v>

656
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

657
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a real crocodile dundee.</v>

658
00:24:42.821 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 1>His name was barry leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went down there to hunt with him in</v>

659
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Australia for 10 days and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

660
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.650
<v Speaker 1>again with a handgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

661
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

662
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I want to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a big bowl,</v>

663
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 1>a big bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a water buffalo.</v>

664
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

665
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

666
00:24:58.011 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 1>well we have to go into a certain part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Australia up near Darwin,</v>

667
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 1>up north.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that,</v>

668
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:05.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't promise you still going to be</v>

669
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a big pond about four or</v>

670
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:10.970
<v Speaker 1>five times as big as this room and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be there in the late afternoon</v>

671
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.330
<v Speaker 1>scratching his back on the roots</v>
<v Speaker 1>overhanging.</v>

672
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And so we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got there and we hiked in four or five</v>

673
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 1>hours and he was there just like he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to be there and he said</v>

674
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:19.904
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

675
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:20.881
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went,</v>

676
00:25:20.881 --> 00:25:21.291
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

677
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 1>not just don't want to just shoot them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bag.</v>

678
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

679
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I want him charging me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

680
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:26.564
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say women.</v>

681
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.360
<v Speaker 1>You wanted him to charge you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Why did you want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw combat,</v>

683
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that so important to you?</v>

684
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Like what is alleged is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just in your mind,</v>

685
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:39.140
<v Speaker 1>you needed to be not fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

686
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

687
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It had to be like life and death combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

688
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't with the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was with some charging beats.</v>

689
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

690
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he throws pebbles.</v>

691
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spins around and he says he won't</v>

692
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>come out this way because it's too far</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him to jump.</v>

693
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.190
<v Speaker 1>And he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't jump that high.</v>

694
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Just like magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Goddamn ball jump 15 feet in the</v>

695
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:04.001
<v Speaker 1>fucking air spun around and right at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about where you are as he ran over me</v>

696
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and I fell back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot once and I hit him through the</v>

697
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:09.400
<v Speaker 1>chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not as knows,</v>

698
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.940
<v Speaker 1>but it missed his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put one hook on my hip and that's why</v>

699
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I had to get a hip eventually and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hook on my left knee.</v>

700
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>So arguably that's why I have a left</v>
<v Speaker 1>knee.</v>

701
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So I felt like I had trained hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he keeps running.</v>

702
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dusted myself off.</v>

703
00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 1>So I've shot one out of five bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I see why I got it.</v>

704
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill this bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm chasing him in the jungle with a</v>

705
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 1>blown out knee and a blown out hip.</v>

706
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm chasing them in the jungle.</v>

707
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

708
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the guide barry leaves is yellen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

709
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't hear them though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm all pumped up.</v>

710
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

711
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:44.880
<v Speaker 1>he's screaming at me so I get close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

712
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I shoot a couple of times more times</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I should have a couple more times,</v>

713
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 1>and then the ball gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spins around just like in the movies</v>

714
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.680
<v Speaker 1>and decided to charge from about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall and just as he got about to where</v>

715
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>that chair is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fired again.</v>

716
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm empty.</v>

717
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he falls down at my feet from the</v>

718
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 1>other times I hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ and so,</v>

719
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 1>but with Barry leaves was yelling at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

720
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking empty.</v>

721
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me I had no more bullets</v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

722
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hear that.</v>

723
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Now when you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

724
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a contest,</v>

725
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 1>martial arts does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you go into automatic?</v>

726
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

727
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 3>You have to think very little while</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in there.</v>

728
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there you have,</v>

729
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 3>when you separate a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sometimes you have time to think</v>

730
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 3>about what you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of it is you're relying on your</v>

731
00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 3>training and your conditioning.</v>

732
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Well I hear you when you are announcing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a those the fields,</v>

733
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:43.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

734
00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's seven guys that are really in</v>

735
00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:47.230
<v Speaker 1>good condition that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:27:47.231 --> 00:27:50.140
<v Speaker 1>the animals are beasts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

737
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.650
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling things.</v>

738
00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:55.900
<v Speaker 1>If you run out of gas in the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third and fourth round,</v>

739
00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:56.690
<v Speaker 1>you're screwed.</v>

740
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's different styles of</v>

741
00:27:58.221 --> 00:27:59.780
<v Speaker 3>fighting too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some guys who just,</v>

742
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.410
<v Speaker 3>they sprint and they can blow you out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first couple of rounds,</v>

743
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.600
<v Speaker 3>but if they get into the third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fourth and fifth round,</v>

744
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.240
<v Speaker 3>they significantly diminished their</v>
<v Speaker 3>output.</v>

745
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

746
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.900
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guys have strategies like to</v>

747
00:28:11.901 --> 00:28:13.760
<v Speaker 3>weather the storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to figure out a way to</v>

748
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:16.820
<v Speaker 3>whether a certain fight or storms and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then take them into the second and third</v>

749
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:17.654
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

750
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy like Hector Lombard is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>famous,</v>

751
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.490
<v Speaker 3>a MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a champion and other</v>

752
00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:23.870
<v Speaker 3>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just a scary,</v>

753
00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:26.630
<v Speaker 3>scary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for one round he might be the</v>

754
00:28:26.631 --> 00:28:28.970
<v Speaker 3>scariest motherfucker and the division,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's terrifying.</v>

755
00:28:28.971 --> 00:28:32.510
<v Speaker 3>He's built like a brick shit house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes at you fast and hard,</v>

756
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.370
<v Speaker 3>but he's so muscular and so strong and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his output is so explosive and kinetic.</v>

757
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.680
<v Speaker 3>He's not like a rhythmic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow,</v>

758
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.080
<v Speaker 3>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>methodical fighter.</v>

759
00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:44.930
<v Speaker 3>He's a sprinter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so after that initial sprint,</v>

760
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:46.550
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not the same in the second and</v>

761
00:28:46.551 --> 00:28:49.550
<v Speaker 3>third rounds usually cause he win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes he wins a lot.</v>

762
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a world class fighter for sure.</v>

763
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.000
<v Speaker 3>The guys I liked with the Diaz brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

764
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Well Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're appropriate.</v>

765
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.240
<v Speaker 3>They're the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're guys who just,</v>

766
00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 3>they just come at you and they can throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>volume for days.</v>

767
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.290
<v Speaker 3>They don't ever get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys can go on and on and on and</v>

768
00:29:02.291 --> 00:29:02.810
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

769
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.190
<v Speaker 3>they break people with their pace.</v>

770
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

771
00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he beat,</v>

772
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older one,</v>

773
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess beat Mcgregor.</v>

774
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the younger one gets nate.</v>

775
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Nate is the younger one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

776
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

777
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a great fight.</v>

778
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.050
<v Speaker 3>It was a fun fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second fight was fun too.</v>

779
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

780
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.700
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so from not having combat experience in</v>

781
00:29:22.701 --> 00:29:25.040
<v Speaker 3>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had like this desire,</v>

782
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 3>real combat experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had this desire to put yourself in</v>

783
00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:29.480
<v Speaker 3>danger and a test yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

784
00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:31.070
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see if I was going to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>or die.</v>

785
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.540
<v Speaker 3>So that's why you decided the next way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do this is to do it with a,</v>

786
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.050
<v Speaker 3>a water buffalo new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking earlier about mercenary</v>

787
00:29:39.051 --> 00:29:39.884
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of,</v>

788
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:40.723
<v Speaker 3>what kind of mercenary?</v>

789
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.490
<v Speaker 1>In the early eighties,</v>

790
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I had the privilege of being mentored by</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantine sauce,</v>

791
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.250

792
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 2>the 60 year right hand man of Aristotle</v>
<v Speaker 2>Onassis.</v>

799
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 2>going to invade Haiti just like Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>did 12 years later.</v>

800
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And just as we were going to launch the</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack in land with boots on the ground,</v>

00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't hold us.</v>

821
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Big Guns aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

822
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 2>the way they do it at the too heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

823
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I was going to be the first foot feet on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and then when that thing fell</v>

824
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:12.131
<v Speaker 2>to shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

825
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just not meant to see combat,</v>

826
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

827
00:31:15.491 --> 00:31:18.250
<v Speaker 2>So it was something that was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to you.</v>

828
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Was it important to you because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know how you would fare or</v>

829
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 2>because you knew how you would fare and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to test yourself or you just</v>

830
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 2>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 100% positive.</v>

831
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I had balls and I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Wienie out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But until you do it,</v>

833
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Growing up as a kid and on the hood and</v>

834
00:31:37.201 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 2>he'd been arrested five times and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trouble.</v>

835
00:31:38.951 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I got him up in the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

836
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>What Hood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still a did you really?</v>

837
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

838
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just over there.</v>

839
00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I like to go to the hood to three times</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year just to see it again.</v>

840
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:55.380
<v Speaker 2>And so I went from the Jonathan Club</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm a member to the hood and uh,</v>

841
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

842
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 2>is my same driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had many years.</v>

843
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we took one of my mentees who's also</v>

844
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:05.971
<v Speaker 2>from the hood Cambodian kid because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambodians drove the Mexicans out of my</v>

845
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>portion of the hood.</v>

846
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.350
<v Speaker 2>And so I went to back to the hood and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to the same grammar school.</v>

847
00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a street.</v>

848
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 2>He went to the same Catholic church I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to.</v>

849
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Now for your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody believes this.</v>

850
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:19.510
<v Speaker 2>But I used to teach catechism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to teach Bible study because I</v>

851
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be a priest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to be a priest when I was a</v>

852
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

853
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

854
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

855
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to believe,</v>

856
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:29.770
<v Speaker 2>but I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe all little Catholic boys when</v>

857
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:30.521
<v Speaker 2>they're 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>

858
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 2>13 wanted to be priest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

859
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>But I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

860
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

861
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got in a lot of trouble when I</v>

862
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:39.890
<v Speaker 2>was in the fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixth grade,</v>

863
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I dropped an aquarium and it's on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

864
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pointed a picture from the second</v>

865
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped an aquarium on my teacher's</v>

866
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 2>head from the second floor.</v>

867
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.790
<v Speaker 2>And if he hadn't moved six inches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be sitting here.</v>

868
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I would have gone to San Quentin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have gone to Juvi Bubba,</v>

869
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would've had a different life.</v>

870
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So he was then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only broke his own,</v>

871
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:02.320
<v Speaker 2>shattered his shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck him up as Christ and I,</v>

872
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 2>that's not the worst thing I did in</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

873
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I was expelled three times before I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of grammar school.</v>

874
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grammar school,</v>

875
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Grammar School.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do?</v>

876
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that to the teacher.</v>

877
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.040
<v Speaker 2>They expelled you for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

878
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 2>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you come back then another guy?</v>

879
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say sorry.</v>

880
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another guy,</v>

881
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:24.920
<v Speaker 2>another guy in the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel sorry?</v>

882
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

883
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't try to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't.</v>

884
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't in my mind old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you at the time?</v>

885
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

886
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.370
<v Speaker 2>So why were you doing that?</v>

887
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 2>He pissed me off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

888
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't really remember why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I dropped the guy damn aquarium</v>

889
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:37.850
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a given.</v>

890
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.920
<v Speaker 2>So another guy I got in a fight with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy in and knocked him down and uh,</v>

891
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I was the biggest guy in grammar school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

892
00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that you were the biggest guy</v>

893
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 2>in grammar school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a Thomas Thomas to grammar school.</v>

894
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some other guy came up and I got in a</v>

895
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Speaker 2>fight knocking him down and apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>he broke his elbow when he fell down and</v>

896
00:33:58.311 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 2>the kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you broke my arm.</v>

897
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 2>He broke my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I did.</v>

898
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I went over and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I broke his arm and six places for real</v>

899
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got to meet her arm and so</v>

900
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 2>fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

901
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that this was from</v>

902
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 2>growing up in the hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just being in the wild dog eat dog</v>

903
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 2>environment?</v>

904
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm positive.</v>

905
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

906
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And so that led you to really want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>test yourself in the military.</v>

907
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look back on all that stuff</v>

908
00:34:26.121 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 2>and all that intense aggression and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those thoughts,</v>

909
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 2>how did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you take anything out of that that</v>

910
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 2>you carry with you as an older man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

911
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.781
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

912
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gentler,</v>

913
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 2>real nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

914
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.761
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

915
00:34:38.761 --> 00:34:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've turned that aggression into a</v>

916
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 2>success in business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about peace and calm?</v>

917
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you have that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't meditate.</v>

918
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't do any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

919
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.030
<v Speaker 2>but do you feel good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like I feel like twisted</v>

920
00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:55.130
<v Speaker 2>steel and panther ipis well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean twisted steel and Panther Piss is</v>

921
00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Speaker 2>an odd combination of field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a Texas oil field.</v>

922
00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

923
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 2>And I just visited a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my buddies from the war who's</v>

924
00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:05.120
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately got a agent orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

925
00:35:05.121 --> 00:35:07.910
<v Speaker 2>You were telling me that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what are the effects of agent?</v>

926
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you get older,</v>

927
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 2>your immune system breaks down and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agent Orange that you had latent in your</v>

928
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:15.590
<v Speaker 2>system now starts to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does it,</v>

929
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:16.131
<v Speaker 2>how does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

930
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lost 40 pounds.</v>

931
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him pick up a core bet when we</v>

932
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>were kids and now he has trouble getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>up steps.</v>

933
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 2>So Agent Orange is some scary shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

934
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could,</v>

935
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.900
<v Speaker 2>it was an exfoliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

936
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Or correctly it defoliant that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprayed on the jungle in Vietnam War.</v>

937
00:35:37.051 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>All these soldiers who are down</v>

938
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 3>there in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

939
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit that they just experimented</v>
<v Speaker 3>on those kids.</v>

940
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just,</v>

941
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:44.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

942
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:46.380
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't forget,</v>

943
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:48.640
<v Speaker 3>that was 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that long ago at all.</v>

944
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every,</v>

945
00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I sat next to Mcnamara when he</v>

946
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 1>was president of the World Bank who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the fathers of the Vietnam War.</v>

947
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

948
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.780
<v Speaker 1>he was a weird dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

949
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

950
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:02.701
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

951
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that the world is going to end</v>

952
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

953
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.680
<v Speaker 1>La Apocalypse and it's going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>haves against the have nots someday.</v>

954
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you'll won't be around when</v>

955
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

956
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

957
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

958
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.830
<v Speaker 1>he says there's certain problems on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant that are never going to get</v>

959
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:22.870
<v Speaker 1>solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talked about the Israeli middle</v>

960
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.030
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

961
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

962
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have had,</v>

963
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time too,</v>

964
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:30.550
<v Speaker 1>holy wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

965
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 1>and you could argue this is just an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extension of the holy war,</v>

966
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

967
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:41.270
<v Speaker 1>we didn't work it out 700 and 780 and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work it out in an 1,118 and we're</v>

968
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 1>not going to work it out this time.</v>

969
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And so he was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

970
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.300
<v Speaker 1>a negative guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Class was half empty instead of half</v>

971
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:49.380
<v Speaker 1>full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

972
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're going to work it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there either.</v>

973
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in partnership with the</v>

974
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Israeli government and I've been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership with the Kuwaiti government,</v>

975
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the Yemen government and a couple others</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

976
00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.273
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

977
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bridge too far.</v>

978
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

979
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

980
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the,</v>

981
00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:09.810
<v Speaker 1>from the Muslim point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

982
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:12.150
<v Speaker 1>and they have the right to practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever religion they want,</v>

983
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's an eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ninth century religion in the 21st</v>

984
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:16.080
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

985
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially acceptable.</v>

986
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.720
<v Speaker 1>You talk about politically correct a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stuff they do,</v>

987
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it transcends being politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

988
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that's going to</v>

989
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:27.953
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

990
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm wrong.</v>

991
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So you think that the way they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for instance,</v>

992
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:37.990
<v Speaker 3>where they treat women the way they</v>
<v Speaker 3>won't let women drive,</v>

993
00:37:37.991 --> 00:37:40.950
<v Speaker 3>the way they make them worthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're religious.</v>

994
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.813
<v Speaker 3>How do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

995
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

996
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:43.510
<v Speaker 3>the burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

997
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you think that that's just going to</v>

998
00:37:45.461 --> 00:37:48.130
<v Speaker 3>stay the way it is forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my lifetime.</v>

999
00:37:48.131 --> 00:37:49.420
<v Speaker 3>In your lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1000
00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a hundred years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like comparing Christianity from</v>

1001
00:37:52.961 --> 00:37:54.740
<v Speaker 3>the inquisition to today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:37:54.741 --> 00:37:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Like so they need it needs to somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another catch up.</v>

1003
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and maybe 500 years a,</v>

1004
00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:01.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the planet's sake,</v>

1005
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.610
<v Speaker 3>I think we haven't been as aliens</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't come to this planet because they</v>

1006
00:38:06.611 --> 00:38:07.810
<v Speaker 3>look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all fucked up.</v>

1007
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:09.990
<v Speaker 3>He's always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1008
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 3>do you contemplate this</v>
<v Speaker 3>car with a glass of Scotch calling?</v>

1009
00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:18.350
<v Speaker 3>We're a fucking aliens here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to shoot Ya.</v>

1010
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're interested in what</v>

1011
00:38:20.981 --> 00:38:22.960
<v Speaker 3>are we going to get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to learn from us?</v>

1012
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be absolutely fascinated if I</v>

1013
00:38:25.871 --> 00:38:30.130
<v Speaker 3>found a group of chimpanzees that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to make fire with sticks</v>

1014
00:38:30.131 --> 00:38:33.220
<v Speaker 3>and we're building structures and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting some sort of a,</v>

1015
00:38:33.221 --> 00:38:36.360
<v Speaker 3>an organized war against other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1016
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I would be absolutely fascinated if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had weapons and they were sneaking up on</v>

1017
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:41.980
<v Speaker 3>these other chimps and using spears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1018
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

1019
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.370
<v Speaker 3>This is us a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1020
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that aliens would feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way about us.</v>

1021
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1022
00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:51.750
<v Speaker 1>except that there are probably a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>years advanced maybe,</v>

1023
00:38:51.751 --> 00:38:54.120
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a hundred years advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1024
00:38:54.121 --> 00:38:56.370
<v Speaker 1>if there are a hundred years advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they would've come down and see,</v>

1025
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.110
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're not ready yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1026
00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.410
<v Speaker 3>well it'd be a hundred years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won't be ready to go to other</v>

1027
00:39:00.411 --> 00:39:02.390
<v Speaker 3>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe someone out there is just a</v>

1028
00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:03.870
<v Speaker 3>little bit more advanced than us now.</v>

1029
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Elon Musk wants to die on Mars.</v>

1030
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1031
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 1>He wants to die on Mars in an electric</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1032
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1033
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the first electric car was Joe.</v>

1034
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:15.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long time ago.</v>

1035
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It was in the early 1900 [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>1860s was it really?</v>

1036
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we really wanted electric cars,</v>

1037
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.810
<v Speaker 1>it was the first car for 2030 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet if we really wanted electric</v>

1038
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:27.150
<v Speaker 1>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think we could have developed</v>

1039
00:39:27.151 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 1>them by now?</v>

1040
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we definitely should have,</v>

1041
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 3>but the influence of the fossil fuel,</v>

1042
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.153
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And do you know why Aramco is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>public?</v>

1044
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.040
<v Speaker 1>The a a national oil company of Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia?</v>

1045
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1046
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.500
<v Speaker 1>You're going to hear it first here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus can't believe they're selling 2%</v>

1047
00:39:43.501 --> 00:39:46.410
<v Speaker 1>of the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because they need money,</v>

1048
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.420
<v Speaker 1>because they've got all the money in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1049
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.170
<v Speaker 1>They want it because when you go public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a reserve report.</v>

1050
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.390
<v Speaker 1>The reserve report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to show how many barrels they</v>

1051
00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:58.020
<v Speaker 1>have proved producing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proved unproved</v>

1052
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.240
<v Speaker 1>and we've been guesstimating for years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and years and years that Aramco has got</v>

1053
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.370
<v Speaker 1>a couple of hundred million barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe three,</v>

1054
00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:06.660
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 million barrels,</v>

1055
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.890
<v Speaker 1>billion barrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

1056
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Speaker 1>That report's going to show they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of barrels and there's no</v>

1057
00:40:13.921 --> 00:40:16.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking way they're ever going to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>fracking,</v>

1058
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.780
<v Speaker 1>electric cars or anything else when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out of their trillions of</v>

1059
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.250
<v Speaker 1>barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to let electric cars</v>

1060
00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:24.570
<v Speaker 1>come to pass.</v>

1061
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.630
<v Speaker 3>So you think like all these oil crisis</v>
<v Speaker 3>warnings and all the talk about them</v>

1062
00:40:29.631 --> 00:40:31.430
<v Speaker 3>running out of oil and places is all</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

1063
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hundred percent hundred.</v>

1064
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you think oil is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1065
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.520
<v Speaker 1>let me just back up a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And August,</v>

1066
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>2014 I was on a a not a show is</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>

1067
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 1>This is yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at some other guy show,</v>

1068
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.290
<v Speaker 1>and I said that when oil was $120 a</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrel,</v>

1069
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.510
<v Speaker 1>we will see $40 oil before we see $200</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

1070
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.760
<v Speaker 1>A bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of my testicles.</v>

1071
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1072
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 1>In February last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil hit $26 a barrel.</v>

1073
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Today's 48 wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a whole bunch of reasons</v>

1074
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that having done business in the</v>

1075
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing Aramco has got hundreds of</v>

1076
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:12.430
<v Speaker 1>trillions of barrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that when the king of Saudi</v>

1077
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Arabia passed away about a year and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half ago,</v>

1078
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.770
<v Speaker 1>and his brother who's a considered not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1079
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 1>is bright as his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half brother died and who hates</v>

1080
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Americans allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who is sick and tired of hearing</v>

1081
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:29.770
<v Speaker 1>about fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to end the frackers</v>

1082
00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:31.510
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

1083
00:41:31.511 --> 00:41:32.940
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

1084
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>see OPEC is great</v>

1085
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 2>except there's no accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only two countries in the world</v>

1086
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 2>that actually I hear to OPEC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

1087
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 2>three countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

1088
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 2>the US and UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else cheats.</v>

1089
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.120
<v Speaker 2>How so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1090
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they produce as much oil as they want.</v>

1091
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 2>So what is OPEC has regulations on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much oil you can produce.</v>

1092
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why did they have those regulations?</v>

1093
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Because they kept the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He correct.</v>

1094
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 2>So they don't drive down the price of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market.</v>

1095
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.560
<v Speaker 3>So now what they're doing with fracking</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they're making oil in America so</v>

1096
00:42:04.561 --> 00:42:07.560
<v Speaker 3>readily available that the s what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing in the Middle East is</v>

1097
00:42:07.561 --> 00:42:10.410
<v Speaker 3>dropping the price down low so that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fracking is not worth doing.</v>

1098
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.970
<v Speaker 2>And a barrel of oil at the wellhead from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a frack.</v>

1099
00:42:15.971 --> 00:42:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost is about 80 bucks a barrel.</v>

1100
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get it there and not to get it</v>

1101
00:42:20.801 --> 00:42:22.900
<v Speaker 2>in the pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to get it to the refinery is not the</v>

1102
00:42:22.901 --> 00:42:24.460
<v Speaker 2>end doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 bucks a barrel.</v>

1103
00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.060
<v Speaker 2>So if they keep all between 40 and 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next a hundred years,</v>

1104
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.380
<v Speaker 2>well the frackers are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:42:32.381 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1106
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1107
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.110
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about fracking?</v>

1108
00:42:35.111 --> 00:42:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Because I've heard mixed stories about</v>
<v Speaker 3>fracking or mixed mixed reports and</v>

1109
00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:42.760
<v Speaker 3>mixed mixed opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people believe that it's a good way</v>

1110
00:42:42.761 --> 00:42:47.761
<v Speaker 3>for us to be independent with our oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to break off from this whole weird</v>

1111
00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:49.720
<v Speaker 3>sort of crisis and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1112
00:42:49.721 --> 00:42:51.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation that we have with the Middle</v>

1113
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.800
<v Speaker 3>East and other people feel like it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>super dangerous.</v>

1114
00:42:53.801 --> 00:42:56.980
<v Speaker 3>And what we're doing is where</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially poisoning water supplies,</v>

1115
00:42:56.981 --> 00:43:00.760
<v Speaker 3>we are creating earthquakes in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>place that's as stable as Oklahoma,</v>

1116
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:04.090
<v Speaker 3>which was like seismically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a nonentity,</v>

1117
00:43:04.091 --> 00:43:05.950
<v Speaker 3>like never had any issues with</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes.</v>

1118
00:43:05.951 --> 00:43:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Now they have tons of earthquakes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just constantly drilling into</v>

1119
00:43:08.921 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who knows where the content,</v>

1120
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>

1121
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 2>both of those theories are correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of the theories,</v>

1122
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a save the world kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1123
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.800
<v Speaker 2>What are you a slash and burn type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

1124
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:20.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not slash and burn.</v>

1125
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:23.870
<v Speaker 2>But I believe that if there is a higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

1126
00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:26.870
<v Speaker 2>he helps those who help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1127
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.291
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1128
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:28.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's convenient to think like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1129
00:43:28.991 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

1130
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:31.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think that way.</v>

1131
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 3>But if he helps those that help</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1132
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:36.900
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't he not help people who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>poison the waters supply?</v>

1133
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1134
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.460
<v Speaker 2>that's an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1135
00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not poisoning</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water supply like,</v>

1136
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.871
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1137
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protesters are saying,</v>

1138
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why frack?</v>

1139
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:54.280
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my theory is correct about Saudi</v>

1140
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Arabia having hundreds of trillions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to,</v>

1141
00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:01.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to allow the fracked</v>

1142
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.380
<v Speaker 2>oil to come to market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do it right?</v>

1143
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.580
<v Speaker 2>If they're never going a lot of correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1144
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.580
<v Speaker 2>So the fracked oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing with it right now?</v>

1145
00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1146
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fracking is down like 70 or 80%.</v>

1147
00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.021
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1148
00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:15.040
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1149
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.350
<v Speaker 2>why is it down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the price of oil.</v>

1150
00:44:17.351 --> 00:44:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1151
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.770
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with environmental</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns.</v>

1152
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like I'm,</v>

1153
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Obama didn't want the pipeline because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of environment concerns,</v>

1154
00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Dakota access pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it all started during his watch.</v>

1155
00:44:29.501 --> 00:44:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

1156
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:35.490
<v Speaker 2>But now trump has says that you can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pipeline because he's looked at the</v>

1157
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:40.800
<v Speaker 2>same studies that I've looked at and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all online on Google is that there</v>

1158
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:44.790
<v Speaker 2>is this much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States and the environmental</v>

1159
00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:47.820
<v Speaker 2>things may be hurting is this much in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

1160
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.380
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made your,</v>

1161
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 2>spread your arms up very wide for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

1162
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you said the about an</v>

1163
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 2>environmental concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it very small.</v>

1164
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it something that if we could</v>

1165
00:44:57.901 --> 00:45:00.630
<v Speaker 2>avoid those very small environmental</v>
<v Speaker 2>disasters,</v>

1166
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.460
<v Speaker 2>so it was very small environmental</v>
<v Speaker 2>disasters,</v>

1167
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 2>they're going to impact that area for</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

1168
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1169
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a significant issue.</v>

1170
00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1171
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.240
<v Speaker 2>there's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1172
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.300
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one side of an argument,</v>

1173
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 2>the other side of the argument and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in between is the truth.</v>

1174
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth lies.</v>

1175
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:24.450
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that's the only way for</v>
<v Speaker 2>us to prosper is to put those areas in</v>

1176
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:24.991
<v Speaker 2>danger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1177
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:26.780
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say that it,</v>

1178
00:45:26.781 --> 00:45:28.730
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a potentially a,</v>

1179
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a potential for an environmental</v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster that could affect that area for</v>

1180
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that risk for financial gain.</v>

1181
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not from to Fresno.</v>

1182
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:38.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying for financial gain.</v>

1183
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not a financial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.330
<v Speaker 2>of course it's a financial gain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the oil business for 20 years</v>

1185
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.690
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>

1186
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.100
<v Speaker 2>where I made my fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the allegedly,</v>

1187
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.413
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1188
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I've got other things very successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the one that they talk about.</v>

1189
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I turned $800 into $500 million in eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1190
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And so forevermore I'm an oil man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1191
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 2>But I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've created 50 billion since then.</v>

1192
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.200
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's more important to 50 billion to</v>

1193
00:46:06.201 --> 00:46:07.034
<v Speaker 2>the 500 million?</v>

1194
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.680
<v Speaker 2>So I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1195
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.110
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1196
00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.491
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1197
00:46:10.491 --> 00:46:14.430
<v Speaker 2>the fact is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>

1198
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Speaker 2>whoever gets in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right now we have trump and he's</v>

1199
00:46:17.491 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 2>backed by the Senate and the congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>

1200
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has promised to be like an</v>

1201
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 2>isolationist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less.</v>

1202
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 2>He's not interested in the wards around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that's right or</v>

1203
00:46:27.241 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that's his position.</v>

1204
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.100
<v Speaker 2>And a majority of the electoral votes</v>
<v Speaker 2>got him elected.</v>

1205
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Not The popular vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but electoral votes.</v>

1206
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1207
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1208
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.350
<v Speaker 2>but whether the United States of America</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a ruining parts of it,</v>

1209
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.750
<v Speaker 2>500 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be ruined a while whilst</v>

1210
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not the overriding,</v>

1211
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

1212
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.050
<v Speaker 2>pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1213
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.570
<v Speaker 2>of what we should be thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we should be thinking about is</v>

1214
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:03.340
<v Speaker 2>doing away with war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1215
00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1216
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.710
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1217
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.590
<v Speaker 2>happily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 2>and I ain't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that and I'm,</v>

1219
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.980
<v Speaker 2>and I'm an aggressive guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that model hasn't worked.</v>

1220
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1221
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why were,</v>

1222
00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 2>there's still wars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1223
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the Iraq war and</v>

1224
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 2>talk about the Afghanistan war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the longest wars we've engaged</v>

1225
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't have to be there.</v>

1226
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1227
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:32.511
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how are we going to keep people</v>

1228
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 2>elected?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>

1229
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>they put us there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1230
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Just like the people elected trump to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put him there,</v>

1231
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 2>just like they elected Clinton to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>him there.</v>

1232
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we still,</v>

1233
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 2>we're still in wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1234
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 2>But Clinton didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was all post nine 11 and</v>

1235
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.150
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was obviously some military</v>

1236
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 2>actions that were involved when Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in office,</v>

1237
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:55.450
<v Speaker 2>but when Bill Clinton was president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the most peaceful times in</v>

1238
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:57.100
<v Speaker 2>the history of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you agree.</v>

1239
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took out a Haiti,</v>

1240
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 2>he followed up on the Dan Pena plan to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take out Haiti.</v>

1241
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 2>That was the Dan Pena Plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CIA.</v>

1242
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Dan Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your trademark.</v>

1243
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.293
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1244
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I can coin it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1245
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that in terms of like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you compare pre,</v>

1246
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush,</v>

1247
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1248
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 2>when nine 11 happened from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been in this perpetual state of</v>

1249
00:48:17.441 --> 00:48:19.720
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but during the entire eight years of</v>

1250
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Clinton was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there were some military</v>

1251
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:23.520
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the more peaceful times,</v>

1252
00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 2>they probably was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably right.</v>

1253
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1254
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't as much worry as a risk</v>

1255
00:48:27.161 --> 00:48:28.420
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like today,</v>

1256
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 2>it seems like there's threats of</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>

1257
00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 2>We're worried about North Korea</v>
<v Speaker 2>instability all around the globe.</v>

1258
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something else for the first on</v>

1259
00:48:37.691 --> 00:48:42.360
<v Speaker 2>your program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think killed the president's</v>

1260
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.120
<v Speaker 2>half brother of North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't they like hire some people?</v>

1261
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was a prank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1262
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:49.390
<v Speaker 2>that's what the story is.</v>

1263
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a different story.</v>

1264
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1265
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.120
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the,</v>

1266
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the North Koreans think that the South</v>

1267
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Koreans did it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that USA CIA did it well.</v>

1268
00:48:58.091 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I thought the North Koreans thought that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the s the brother did it,</v>

1269
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.610
<v Speaker 2>that Kim Jong Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did it too.</v>

1270
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Because the brother was kind of sneaked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to send a message to North Korea.</v>

1272
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of messages that,</v>

1273
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck with us.</v>

1274
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they could do a better job</v>

1275
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 2>of sending that message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1276
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they killed him I guess,</v>

1277
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:18.420
<v Speaker 2>but who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even in the,</v>

1278
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.941
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1279
00:49:18.941 --> 00:49:20.930
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they believe you can kill the</v>
<v Speaker 2>half-brother.</v>

1280
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 2>The president can kill the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that will probably be a better</v>

1281
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they did do that,</v>

1282
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:26.320
<v Speaker 2>don't you think it would just create a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacuum?</v>

1283
00:49:26.321 --> 00:49:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Like the same thing that happened and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really,</v>

1284
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't read enough books to know that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't read any books on and Libya,</v>

1285
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:35.650
<v Speaker 2>but I've watched a lot of documentaries</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that whole Kadafi situation.</v>

1286
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a complete cluster fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1287
00:49:37.781 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean the United States government has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing that for a hundred years,</v>

1288
00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 2>where they back the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to be a crooked</v>

1289
00:49:43.361 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they got to go take all the</v>

1290
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>backing away from him and then avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is created.</v>

1291
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 2>And then the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come in or worse,</v>

1292
00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in their rack,</v>

1293
00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:54.491
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1294
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.220
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing that for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1295
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1296
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.620
<v Speaker 2>but what's happening in Libya and Libya</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a basically a failed state.</v>

1297
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:01.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary place right now.</v>

1298
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1299
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.210
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to people that were there</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre,</v>

1300
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre Kadafi or during Qaddafi's</v>

1301
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're like,</v>

1302
00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:10.420
<v Speaker 2>it's way safer then when Kadafi was</v>
<v Speaker 2>running things.</v>

1303
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Obviously if you were a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enemy of Kadafi,</v>

1304
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:15.790
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't safe for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was all a brutal dictator.</v>

1305
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the business of running countries,</v>

1306
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 2>especially running countries all around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is a horrible,</v>

1307
00:50:20.801 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messy business.</v>

1308
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Messi,</v>

1309
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>brutal evil business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always underestimated.</v>

1310
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite sayings is never</v>

1311
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 2>underestimate how wrong you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1312
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1313
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:33.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we always seem to underestimate it.</v>

1314
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1315
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

1316
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get better.</v>

1317
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.243
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gotten better.</v>

1318
00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 2>We've gotten better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean since caveman,</v>

1319
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 2>since that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since that chimpanzee to learn how to</v>

1320
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 2>use a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1321
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we've gotten better.</v>

1322
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1323
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:50.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been getting better for 40,000</v>

1324
00:50:50.211 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 2>years and the planet's been alive for</v>
<v Speaker 2>13.8 billion years,</v>

1325
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.810
<v Speaker 2>but we've only had Google for like 20 Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1326
00:50:56.811 --> 00:50:57.471
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1327
00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not such a proponent of that Google</v>

1328
00:50:59.471 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 2>is going to change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think so.</v>

1329
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:01.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd Ha,</v>

1330
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like the millennials think or the,</v>

1331
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.960
<v Speaker 2>or maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1332
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm a generation X.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1333
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole generation thing,</v>

1334
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.660
<v Speaker 2>we get labels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real possibility that</v>

1335
00:51:14.661 --> 00:51:16.970
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a lot of,</v>

1336
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 2>there's some battles going on right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>with information where people trying to</v>

1337
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:23.760
<v Speaker 2>figure out how it should affect things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it should affect and,</v>

1338
00:51:23.761 --> 00:51:25.850
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of an impact it's ultimately</v>

1339
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 2>going to have in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's having a massive</v>

1340
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's hard for us to,</v>

1341
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:31.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I said Google,</v>

1342
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 2>but google meaning the ability to search</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1343
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going be a big access to</v>

1344
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:40.270
<v Speaker 2>information through those portals dated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with instant information.</v>

1345
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1346
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:47.110
<v Speaker 2>what took guys years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research for a phd paper can be now</v>

1347
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:51.500
<v Speaker 2>researched in days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks or that,</v>

1348
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a magical time when it comes to</v>

1349
00:51:54.831 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1350
00:51:55.430 --> 00:52:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like that if anything is</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna change foreign countries quicker</v>

1351
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.520
<v Speaker 2>than any other kind of change because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like just having the access to the</v>

1352
00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:07.550
<v Speaker 2>information that things are different or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parts of the world that people are</v>

1353
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 2>thinking differently than they ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought before,</v>

1354
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.570
<v Speaker 2>that there's more understanding about</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that we have more in common than</v>

1355
00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:17.540
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then this idea that countries are</v>

1356
00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 2>against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the countries are there consistent of</v>

1357
00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:21.680
<v Speaker 2>people that don't even know each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>

1358
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.620
<v Speaker 2>And we're supposed to be against some</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people that we don't know.</v>

1359
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 2>And then some of the part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1360
00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:27.820
<v Speaker 2>why is it then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1361
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.630
<v Speaker 2>tenement square in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1362
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beijing 30,</v>

1363
00:52:32.031 --> 00:52:34.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever years ago it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1364
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 2>when we were in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1365
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.450
<v Speaker 2>not too long ago as it gets to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

1366
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most kids don't even know that that</v>

1367
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1368
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they have google.</v>

1369
00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same in Russia.</v>

1370
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salmon countries in South America.</v>

1371
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Now getting back to why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1372
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:52.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1373
00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.220
<v Speaker 2>the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1374
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 2>hydrocarbons are so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia's got a oil driven economy.</v>

1375
00:52:59.421 --> 00:53:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Now a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the countries in South America</v>

1376
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 2>have oil driven economies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Canada has an old driven economy.</v>

1377
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1378
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:10.820
<v Speaker 2>the U K arguably has an old driven</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>

1379
00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 2>not visa vi the North Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1380
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s it doesn't really have an old</v>

1381
00:53:15.851 --> 00:53:17.270
<v Speaker 2>driven economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has a big,</v>

1382
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:22.271
<v Speaker 2>big part of what happens now when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are making loans from financial</v>

1383
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 2>institutions at a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$120 oil with projections because some</v>

1384
00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 2>dip Shit Mba did a spreadsheet on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1385
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 2>to a $200 oil and you make loans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now all those loans are underwater,</v>

1386
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 2>pun intended for the offshore stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that what happened?</v>

1387
00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:40.740
<v Speaker 2>They made loans based on the prediction</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would continue to go up.</v>

1388
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 2>So some sort of a universal growth or</v>
<v Speaker 2>continual growth paradigm,</v>

1389
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.560
<v Speaker 2>but anybody that's from the business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was knew that that was horseshit.</v>

1390
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:53.520
<v Speaker 2>Why did they think that unlimited growth</v>
<v Speaker 2>in oil was going to happen and it was</v>

1391
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:56.520
<v Speaker 2>going to get to $200 a bottle if guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are barrel rather if guys like you</v>

1392
00:53:56.521 --> 00:54:01.521
<v Speaker 2>thought it was horse shit because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole other generation has come up,</v>

1393
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:05.220
<v Speaker 2>it didn't suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last oral decline that lasts oil</v>

1394
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 2>decline was w is the early eighties</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the mid eighties.</v>

1395
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.910
<v Speaker 2>When oil went from $40 a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they $6 a barrel and then went back</v>

1396
00:54:11.911 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 2>up to $35 a barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those guys are either dead in jail</v>

1397
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 2>or retired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1398
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:21.180
<v Speaker 2>And now they've got young guys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned something in a book.</v>

1399
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I went to good schools and know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do spreadsheets,</v>

1400
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:26.910
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have the experience.</v>

1401
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:28.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1402
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.063
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1403
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:32.320
<v Speaker 2>we have tons and tons of information but</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1404
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.250
<v Speaker 2>we don't have running a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies is tons and tons of</v>

1405
00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:36.084
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1406
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of dots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have the people that have</v>

1407
00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:44.760
<v Speaker 2>connected the dots now to connect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dots to find out how much the Middle</v>

1408
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.880
<v Speaker 2>East actually has in barrels of oil is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trillions of bows.</v>

1409
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would one do that?</v>

1410
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this public information like what</v>

1411
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 2>you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't know.</v>

1412
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1413
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:57.420
<v Speaker 2>because I was partners with Kuwaiti</v>
<v Speaker 2>government for seven years.</v>

1414
00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I used to be their fair haired boy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

1415
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1416
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a fair haired boy,</v>

1417
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.860
<v Speaker 2>fair haired boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fair haired boy means that I was their</v>

1419
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:08.900
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a what?</v>

1420
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 2>A weird expression and a fair haired</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

1421
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair haired.</v>

1422
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I want black hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1423
00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have blue eyes.</v>

1424
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm fairing my complexion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

1425
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I get it.</v>

1426
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:19.743
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

1427
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1428
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:21.443
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1429
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very surprising and Aramco</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to go public with the numbers</v>

1430
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:28.380
<v Speaker 2>because it's been one of the great big</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets of all time and the energy</v>

1431
00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:28.910
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

1432
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.060
<v Speaker 2>They're going public with the numbers to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discourage further frack.</v>

1433
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to say,</v>

1434
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:33.870
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1435
00:55:33.871 --> 00:55:36.300
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would rather have 100% of this thing</v>

1436
00:55:36.301 --> 00:55:37.940
<v Speaker 2>at half the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1437
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Then lose it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1438
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>And the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the ultra alternative energy</v>

1439
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:46.950
<v Speaker 2>deals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the in the United States in the UK are</v>

1440
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 2>funded by grants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government programs that fail.</v>

1441
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't make you,</v>

1442
00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:57.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't make any money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you stopped doing that,</v>

1443
00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:59.970
<v Speaker 2>the average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average cost for a barrel of oil,</v>

1444
00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.490
<v Speaker 2>not fracking in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1445
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.260
<v Speaker 2>is about 45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 bucks a barrel.</v>

1446
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Who right at the break even to bring it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to the wellhead now.</v>

1447
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the Middle East,</v>

1448
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 2>taking all of them in into account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about three bucks,</v>

1449
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 2>a berry dollars a barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of the countries less than a</v>

1450
00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 2>buck flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck can they do then?</v>

1451
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Because the oil is right there here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and they found oil.</v>

1452
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 2>They were living in tents as better wins</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were looking for water cause</v>

1453
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:31.540
<v Speaker 2>they'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if they hadn't found water a hundred</v>

1454
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.373
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all be dead.</v>

1455
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't need the water cause they</v>

1456
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:39.841
<v Speaker 2>got the oil that they paid to take to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the water drinkable.</v>

1457
00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.230
<v Speaker 2>D salient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incorrect.</v>

1458
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the word I was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1459
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.350
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1460
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an amazing thing.</v>

1461
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:49.810
<v Speaker 2>So why is Exxon bothering to drill in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gulf coast?</v>

1462
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Because hope springs eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they want to plan for the future.</v>

1463
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drilled in the Gulf coast,</v>

1464
00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was winning a big oil company,</v>

1465
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1466
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's two parts of the Gulf coast.</v>

1467
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 2>There's the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a 600 feet deep.</v>

1468
00:57:07.211 --> 00:57:09.750
<v Speaker 2>And then there's beyond the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like 10,000 feet.</v>

1469
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big money to do all those tests.</v>

1470
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1471
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1472
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 2>the big guys like Exxon are looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>elephants.</v>

1473
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big reserves,</v>

1474
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 2>a smaller independence like I was was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for a,</v>

1475
00:57:22.241 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smaller reserves.</v>

1476
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 2>No want to Exxon goes and looks for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big reserves to what kind of equipment</v>

1477
00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:29.800
<v Speaker 2>did they use to dick to decide where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil is?</v>

1478
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1479
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.480
<v Speaker 2>an offshore drilling rig will cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>between a in the shallow at 25 to 40</v>

1480
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.410
<v Speaker 2>million and in the deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1481
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>75 to 250 million for just the rig.</v>

1482
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.920
<v Speaker 2>The thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do they know where the oil,</v>

1483
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 2>so they have geologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're like,</v>

1484
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.240
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a personal point of view.</v>

1485
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Geologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geophysicist.</v>

1486
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1487
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.560
<v Speaker 2>You're better off with a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they basically know there's a shit</v>

1488
00:57:57.561 --> 00:58:02.260
<v Speaker 2>load of oil out there somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drilling now what is oil?</v>

1489
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Explain to me what is oil?</v>

1490
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I read a book a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The confused the fuck out of me.</v>

1491
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:08.740
<v Speaker 2>It was called black gold stranglehold</v>
<v Speaker 2>and know if you've heard about it.</v>

1492
00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never read it.</v>

1493
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 2>It was a book that was saying that oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not fossil fuels and then it's not</v>

1494
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 2>what people think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually a renewal process that</v>

1495
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:22.330
<v Speaker 2>the earth creates this oil and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wells go dry.</v>

1496
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:23.860
<v Speaker 2>And then if you leave them alone for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

1497
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 2>they build up with the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1498
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 2>not why they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the theory.</v>

1499
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:32.020
<v Speaker 2>But nobody's ever left the well alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone long enough to find out if that's</v>

1500
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 2>true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1501
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 2>so we're talking about hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

1502
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 2>They're not talking about 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

1503
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but wells also this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be,</v>

1504
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like a wacky book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those books.</v>

1505
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I was reading of your word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the holographic universe.</v>

1506
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another book.</v>

1507
00:58:45.041 --> 00:58:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Quick halfway in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1508
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a goofy ass book.</v>

1509
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much goofiness in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that Black Gold's triangle hold,</v>

1510
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to a real oil man about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1511
00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:00.540
<v Speaker 2>So oil is created by what things dying</v>
<v Speaker 2>deteriorating from 40,</v>

1512
00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:02.320
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred million years ago.</v>

1513
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they sit under the ground and they a</v>

1514
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.160
<v Speaker 2>form hydrocarbons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1515
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:13.200
<v Speaker 2>two different kinds of hydrocarbons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either that's a gas and oil and uh,</v>

1516
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:17.740
<v Speaker 2>and when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes up that comes up one pipe</v>

1517
00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and there's a separator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you just have a pure oil</v>

1518
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:21.064
<v Speaker 2>wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you have it,</v>

1519
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 2>a pure gas well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly you have a mix.</v>

1520
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's a separator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a unit that is a,</v>

1521
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers,</v>

1522
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 2>a wet dream at the top that separates</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

1523
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Then it's put into a pipeline and taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a refinery or it's put into a truck</v>

1524
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:37.110
<v Speaker 2>and taken to a refinery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1525
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 2>and some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1526
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.501
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1527
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distillate,</v>

1528
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.940
<v Speaker 2>the actual or oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1529
00:59:42.941 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 2>depending on the gravity can go straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a car.</v>

1530
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how pure realist,</v>

1531
00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And doesn't have to be refined.</v>

1532
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Of course the refiners don't like those</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of wells because then they,</v>

1533
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 2>what is it when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have to refine it?</v>

1534
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been sat under the ground,</v>

1535
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 2>the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less time it's been under the</v>

1536
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've got moral that's been there</v>

1537
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:05.600
<v Speaker 2>40 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will look like kerosene.</v>

1538
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.390
<v Speaker 2>If you've got an oil that it's only been</v>
<v Speaker 2>there 10 million years,</v>

1539
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it look a black and gunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1540
01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>

1541
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.210
<v Speaker 2>we used to call it dead dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really animal matter as</v>

1542
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:18.170
<v Speaker 2>much as it is plant matter.</v>

1543
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that true plant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1544
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.480
<v Speaker 2>mostly planning on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1545
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:24.920
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a teary or rating leaves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trees and things along those lines.</v>

1546
01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>And then it's slowly but surely over</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of years becomes oil.</v>

1547
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.300
<v Speaker 2>What a weird thing to power our world</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1548
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1549
01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been around a long time,</v>

1550
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.050
<v Speaker 2>but if we really wanted to electric</v>
<v Speaker 2>batteries,</v>

1551
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.890
<v Speaker 2>we've had those 40 years longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had a gasoline cars.</v>

1552
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.270
<v Speaker 2>What are your feelings on solar solar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1553
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.900
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for every square foot on the earth,</v>

1554
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.620
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural sun with no nothing,</v>

1555
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1556
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:58.090
<v Speaker 2>advancing the Sun's light gives between</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and 13,000 times more energy than the</v>

1557
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:03.740
<v Speaker 2>planet needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 to 13,000 for every square foot just</v>

1558
01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:06.230
<v Speaker 2>from the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1559
01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

1560
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me sort that out.</v>

1561
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>So what you mean is if you put solar</v>
<v Speaker 2>panels on every square foot,</v>

1562
01:01:15.231 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 2>you'd have 10 to 13 times more than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet needs.</v>

1563
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein.</v>

1564
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you wouldn't really put solar powers</v>

1565
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>over the whole correct planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to be able to power a city,</v>

1566
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.210
<v Speaker 2>what would you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1567
01:01:29.211 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say,</v>

1568
01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] alley.</v>

1569
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.760
<v Speaker 2>How dare you call me Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1570
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the valley,</v>

1571
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:36.403
<v Speaker 2>the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1572
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need solar panels that would cover</v>

1573
01:01:39.471 --> 01:01:40.550
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1574
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>downtown Los Angeles to</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Diego,</v>

1575
01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's under current solar</v>

1576
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten much less expensive to do</v>

1577
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:52.810
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1578
01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Because then you've got to sell the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff into the grid.</v>

1579
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.170
<v Speaker 2>The grid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning the power thing,</v>

1580
01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:58.440
<v Speaker 2>like a scent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nuts.</v>

1581
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>What's the power thing up here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1582
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:02.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever the power company electric</v>
<v Speaker 2>company is.</v>

1583
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 2>So you sell into the grid and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you,</v>

1584
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the government was giving</v>

1585
01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were paying like 18 to 20 cents per</v>

1586
01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.900
<v Speaker 2>kilowatt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're paying two to 3 cents.</v>

1587
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 2>So people invested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schmucks,</v>

1588
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>banks lend out Shannon's schmucks,</v>

1589
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>lend out 10 hundreds of billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars to the solar guys because at the</v>

1590
01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>13 to 18 cents a megawatt and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply,</v>

1591
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>then we had too much supply because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's doing it and drove down the</v>

1592
01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now these poor bastards that</v>

1593
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>started these solar deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1594
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago,</v>

1595
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>can't make any money.</v>

1596
01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.080
<v Speaker 3>So they can't pay off their debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys that benefit the most from</v>

1597
01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:50.081
<v Speaker 3>solar or the farmers that own the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that lease to the solar companies.</v>

1598
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's another one of those unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 3>growth things where they felt like it</v>

1599
01:02:53.931 --> 01:02:57.800
<v Speaker 3>was 10 cents back then per kilowatt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's eventually going to be 20 and 30.</v>

1600
01:02:57.801 --> 01:02:59.540
<v Speaker 3>They kept thought it was going to go up</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead it went down.</v>

1601
01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.090
<v Speaker 3>And why did it go down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because oversupply,</v>

1602
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:05.600
<v Speaker 3>because everybody gets on a a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they make it bad.</v>

1603
01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.000
<v Speaker 3>But when you say you sell it back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>grid,</v>

1604
01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:09.890
<v Speaker 3>there's also ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be off the grid,</v>

1605
01:03:09.891 --> 01:03:11.600
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Craft a different system.</v>

1606
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:13.390
<v Speaker 3>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1609
01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bright guy put together a tax</v>

1610
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>incentive deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1611
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 1>in the Britain they called schemes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1612
01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1613
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took advantage of the system.</v>

1614
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in Germany for example,</v>

1615
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany has a 20,</v>

1616
01:03:31.081 --> 01:03:33.780
<v Speaker 1>25 year contracts and the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't any smarter.</v>

1617
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>They gave you a 25 year contract at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee 11 cents.</v>

1618
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now into the grid,</v>

1619
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>it's only 3 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got to pay you off and it was</v>

1620
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.570
<v Speaker 1>between three and 11 and uh,</v>

1621
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 3>contract's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once it's up,</v>

1622
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 3>everybody's screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

1623
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's screwed.</v>

1624
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1625
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:57.330
<v Speaker 3>do you think that it's a viable way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>power a city?</v>

1626
01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1627
01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.790
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's a mix.</v>

1628
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:01.860
<v Speaker 3>You need a mix really not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1629
01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:04.800
<v Speaker 3>not just solar undercurrent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technological solar,</v>

1630
01:04:04.801 --> 01:04:08.070
<v Speaker 3>wind and a hydrocarbons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Speaker 3>We were in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some were filming something for fear</v>

1632
01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:12.870
<v Speaker 3>factor wants and they had one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a windmill farms.</v>

1633
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.700
<v Speaker 3>It was the craziest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1634
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 3>like a bunch of robots that were up on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hill.</v>

1635
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're spinning around and was like,</v>

1636
01:04:18.871 --> 01:04:21.540
<v Speaker 3>you're getting there getting electricity</v>
<v Speaker 3>from these wind robots.</v>

1637
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Like how fucking weird is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And each one of those deals costs</v>

1638
01:04:24.731 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking of $1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1639
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Each one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1640
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.800
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology,</v>

1641
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:31.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

1642
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>has come a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long way and the 30 or 40 years that</v>

1643
01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:37.640
<v Speaker 1>they've had those wind when deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1644
01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:43.520
<v Speaker 1>supposedly the wind currents don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>change [inaudible] wrong,</v>

1645
01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.020
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do change.</v>

1646
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've built a hundred of these</v>

1647
01:04:48.441 --> 01:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>windmills facing a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1648
01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the wind changes for whatever</v>

1649
01:04:53.661 --> 01:04:56.750
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know the thing you're going to</v>

1650
01:04:56.751 --> 01:04:58.280
<v Speaker 1>hear first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1651
01:04:58.281 --> 01:05:00.380
<v Speaker 1>in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I,</v>

1652
01:05:00.381 --> 01:05:03.710
<v Speaker 1>we had our bows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew it at the South Pole magnetic</v>

1653
01:05:03.711 --> 01:05:07.130
<v Speaker 1>south pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to be married down and they have</v>

1654
01:05:07.131 --> 01:05:11.120
<v Speaker 1>a huge $500 million scientific research</v>
<v Speaker 1>lab,</v>

1655
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.460
<v Speaker 1>most of which is paid for by the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States government.</v>

1656
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>So we're down there and we're talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the goofball scientists around in</v>

1657
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tee shirts and flip flops.</v>

1658
01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's 40 below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1659
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause it sun never goes down.</v>

1660
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>This was December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1661
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and so they're giving us a presentation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're bringing out these cores of</v>

1662
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>ice cores of ice and they get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second or third corps and then he says,</v>

1663
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>this core is 55,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I'm a,</v>

1664
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1665
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>they explained and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 13,000 years ago.</v>

1666
01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>This was the temperature of 14,050 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1667
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>It was two degrees warmer Celsius than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is today.</v>

1668
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:53.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you go stop 55,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was two degrees warmer than it is</v>

1669
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1670
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about global warming?</v>

1671
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1672
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously all 10 and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

1673
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.840
<v Speaker 1>All 10 phds from Mit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caltech,</v>

1674
01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:12.841
<v Speaker 1>snapper started laughing when they laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>because global warming is a joke.</v>

1675
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>How's global warming a joke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you what they said.</v>

1676
01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It was warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two degrees Celsius,</v>

1677
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's a 55,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1678
01:06:19.971 --> 01:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>if you go back 65 million years ago is</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerably warmer than I understand</v>

1679
01:06:23.421 --> 01:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they were saying is that it's</v>

1680
01:06:24.891 --> 01:06:25.760
<v Speaker 1>cyclical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1681
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument is whether or not we're</v>

1682
01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>contributing to this cyclical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we are.</v>

1683
01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we wait 10,000 years,</v>

1685
01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>there won't be any global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll go back to cold.</v>

1686
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people,</v>

1687
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>you're descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my descendants,</v>

1688
01:06:42.351 --> 01:06:45.780
<v Speaker 1>if they're around 10,000 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll read about that.</v>

1689
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Who are those guys have believed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming.</v>

1690
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>So you think that people are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterical about a natural cycle that we</v>

1691
01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>probably are.</v>

1692
01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably helping it along.</v>

1693
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>We're helping it along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a natural cycle,</v>

1694
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to come back around</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1695
01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Another point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if global warming,</v>

1696
01:07:02.031 --> 01:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>we're for real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1697
01:07:03.021 --> 01:07:03.381
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

1698
01:07:03.381 --> 01:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>real that's going to happen is he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have next 20,</v>

1699
01:07:06.111 --> 01:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1700
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of Central America,</v>

1701
01:07:12.501 --> 01:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of the part of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be gone because there'll be</v>

1702
01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1703
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1705
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe,</v>

1706
01:07:19.851 --> 01:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>it's 30 meters of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hundred feet.</v>

1707
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>The less severe is 10 meters of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 feet.</v>

1708
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that were the case and you were</v>

1709
01:07:26.991 --> 01:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>building condominiums in Fort</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lauderdale,</v>

1710
01:07:29.121 --> 01:07:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be a disclaimer in the</v>

1711
01:07:32.221 --> 01:07:33.054
<v Speaker 1>prospectus.</v>

1712
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1713
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>there should be a disclaimer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next big way,</v>

1714
01:07:36.921 --> 01:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>the class action lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if global warming happens in the next 20</v>

1715
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:43.180
<v Speaker 1>to 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be the disclaimers that were</v>

1716
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>not written in an investment perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>for condominiums,</v>

1717
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.330
<v Speaker 1>buildings everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan's gone,</v>

1718
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you know London has gone well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only under severe forecast,</v>

1719
01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Severe forecasts.</v>

1720
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 1>The best forecast is it's going to be 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>meters,</v>

1721
01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.680
<v Speaker 1>10 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just dirty feet.</v>

1722
01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the best forecasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best forecasts over how many years?</v>

1723
01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>A 50 so you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that's going to happen?</v>

1724
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not likely to be here 50 years from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1725
01:08:09.241 --> 01:08:12.120
<v Speaker 1>so I had a pretty good dude if they keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing shit.</v>

1726
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm pretty good.</v>

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy cause I'm enjoying doing what</v>

1733
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:28.910
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you realize 87% Gallup poll came out</v>

1734
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 3>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's at 87% of the people on the planet</v>

1735
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:36.580
<v Speaker 3>or unhappy with what their life is all</v>
<v Speaker 3>about now on have the and 10% in</v>

1736
01:08:37.191 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 3>addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>87 to 97 hate what they do.</v>

1737
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 3>A little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that leaves 3% of the planet.</v>

1738
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're one of 3%.</v>

1739
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the 100000000th of a percent.</v>

1740
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy.</v>

1741
01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether to shit or go</v>
<v Speaker 3>blind.</v>

1742
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't do the second part.</v>

1743
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Every little behind a chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go blind.</v>

1744
01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:57.441
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1745
01:08:57.441 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that makes you happier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1746
01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 3>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to figure out how to give</v>

1747
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 3>me new eyes.</v>

1748
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.670
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think they're gonna figure out</v>

1749
01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:07.310
<v Speaker 3>how to give you new eyes or do you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to figure out how to shoot</v>

1750
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 3>some stem cells in your eyes or Ridgeway</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm uh,</v>

1751
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear after the program about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stem cells in Vegas.</v>

1752
01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:14.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got a lot of crazy shit going</v>

1753
01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:15.470
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing discs now.</v>

1754
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:16.370
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1755
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.620
<v Speaker 3>are just starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1756
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 3>talked to Dr. Davidson from the UFC and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're beginning trials.</v>

1757
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I think they were going to do it this</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday,</v>

1758
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 3>so past Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of days ago where they're going</v>

1759
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 3>to shoot stem cells directly into discs</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people with degenerative disc disease</v>

1760
01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 3>where their discs are shrinking because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the compression of the spine and you</v>

1761
01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:36.260
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just overall life and wearing down,</v>

1762
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.480
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to regenerate</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tissue.</v>

1763
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1764
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:40.790
<v Speaker 3>what's a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read a couple of days ago,</v>

1765
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a transgender guy broke the eye socket</v>

1766
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 3>of a girl in an MMA fight.</v>

1767
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a recent,</v>

1768
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.780
<v Speaker 3>the last 48 hours to know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1769
01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 3>And they're complaining because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>really a girl,</v>

1770
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a guy and he was just overpowered</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just,</v>

1771
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of a broken eye socket.</v>

1772
01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 3>And when those guys sockets are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>common,</v>

1773
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:07.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1774
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.970
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

1775
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 3>And can I soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's broken.</v>

1776
01:10:09.381 --> 01:10:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Orbitals very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very common.</v>

1777
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:15.310
<v Speaker 3>If you get punched or kicked or elbowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard in the eyeball,</v>

1778
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 3>which sounds horrible to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1779
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 3>you get a blowout fracture where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually blow out the bone in the back</v>

1780
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 3>of the eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have to literally take your eye</v>

1781
01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:27.230
<v Speaker 3>out and they have to go behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Repair usually at that,</v>

1782
01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they have to put like a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>plate or something that puts the bone</v>

1783
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 3>back together in the back of your eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put your eye back in.</v>

1784
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.470
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes when guys do get those</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of orbital fractures,</v>

1785
01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:40.220
<v Speaker 3>they have these weird eyes like the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>I that like pokes forward more than the</v>

1786
01:10:40.221 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 3>other eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks weird.</v>

1787
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Very Dangerous Sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous sport,</v>

1788
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:47.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just obviously it's a combat sport.</v>

1789
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Kind of smash each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1790
01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I've been pretty vocal about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

1791
01:10:51.231 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 3>a a pretty famous case of a guy who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been a guy for 30 years,</v>

1792
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.750
<v Speaker 3>became a woman for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1793
01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went transgender,</v>

1794
01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:02.060
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And started fighting MMA and wasn't</v>

1795
01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:06.620
<v Speaker 3>telling these women that she used to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a man for 30 fucking years and I was</v>

1796
01:11:06.621 --> 01:11:07.430
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's crazy.</v>

1797
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Like if you tell people and they still</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to fight,</v>

1798
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.300
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able do whatever</v>

1799
01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.680
<v Speaker 3>you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like I think you should be able to</v>

1800
01:11:12.681 --> 01:11:13.514
<v Speaker 3>ride a bull.</v>

1801
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I support your right to ride a</v>

1802
01:11:15.331 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to ride a bull.</v>

1803
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you you shouldn't do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't,</v>

1804
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck am I to tell you they</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't jump out of buildings and a</v>

1805
01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 3>and skydive or jump out of planes rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a jump off cliffs with one of those</v>

1806
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 3>wingsuits like my friend Andy does you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>

1807
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You should be able do whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do as long as you're informed,</v>

1808
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>but this idea that it's not something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you need to tell the other person</v>

1809
01:11:35.581 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 3>about because now you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that's bullshit.</v>

1810
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.370
<v Speaker 3>You're a biologically a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were born a man,</v>

1811
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:42.720
<v Speaker 3>you have an x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>y chromosome.</v>

1812
01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 3>You have all sorts of mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages.</v>

1813
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 3>You have different bone structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the fucking same.</v>

1814
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:52.680
<v Speaker 3>And if these people want to continue</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy narrative that once you</v>

1815
01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 3>decide that you identify with being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

1816
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.160
<v Speaker 3>he should be able to compete as a woman.</v>

1817
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1818
01:11:58.021 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you saw what happened with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid in high school.</v>

1819
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.500
<v Speaker 3>There was a kid in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:05.490
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wanted to be a boy and so they</v>

1821
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:07.200
<v Speaker 3>started giving her testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatments,</v>

1822
01:12:07.201 --> 01:12:11.220
<v Speaker 3>but she still has to compete as a girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>in wrestling while she's transitioning</v>

1823
01:12:11.221 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 3>to being a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they giving her these testosterone</v>

1824
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>treatments and she's just mauling these</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>

1825
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not fair.</v>

1826
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 3>What happened to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1827
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.920
<v Speaker 3>the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not her fault,</v>

1828
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:20.670
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid,</v>

1829
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.060
<v Speaker 3>that's the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that live there want her to</v>

1830
01:12:24.061 --> 01:12:26.190
<v Speaker 3>compete as a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that's the case,</v>

1831
01:12:26.191 --> 01:12:28.830
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't allow her to be competing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to taking testosterone.</v>

1832
01:12:28.831 --> 01:12:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if she wants to compete as a boy</v>

1833
01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 3>letter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compete as a boy,</v>

1834
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 3>or I let him compete as a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In your opinion,</v>

1835
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 3>what happened to the young girl?</v>

1836
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:38.820
<v Speaker 3>That was Ronda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1837
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.810
<v Speaker 3>The Olympian girl that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden went from the penthouse</v>

1838
01:12:42.811 --> 01:12:45.360
<v Speaker 3>to the Shit House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of things.</v>

1839
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long story.</v>

1840
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I was a big sign over her amazing judo</v>
<v Speaker 3>practitioner,</v>

1841
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:55.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dominant like no one else ever in</v>

1842
01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:58.950
<v Speaker 3>women's mma up to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the UFC at least.</v>

1843
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:04.370
<v Speaker 3>But there was some holes in her approach</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were exposed by Holly Holm.</v>

1844
01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 3>The point in the doctor out girl head</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked her.</v>

1845
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Holly had the perfect style to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda style.</v>

1846
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 3>She's really strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's fast,</v>

1847
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:16.050
<v Speaker 3>she's amazing athlete and she is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>outstanding striker and so ron does</v>

1848
01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 3>thing was to charge at you like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bull.</v>

1849
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.550
<v Speaker 3>And Holly just played the Matador,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliantly caught her,</v>

1850
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.960
<v Speaker 3>lit her up while she was coming in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then eventually had kicked her and</v>

1851
01:13:24.961 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 3>stopped her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get knocked out like that,</v>

1852
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:29.040
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was very,</v>

1853
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 3>very confident while she was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

1854
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And some people would say arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

1855
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:36.300
<v Speaker 3>there's all these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for you to fall.</v>

1856
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have much confidence and when they</v>

1857
01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:41.610
<v Speaker 3>see someone who's out there who's got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of confidence,</v>

1858
01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:44.580
<v Speaker 3>it's very compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a floyd mayweather or Latin conor</v>

1859
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:45.460
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1860
01:13:45.461 --> 01:13:47.250
<v Speaker 3>their confidence is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling.</v>

1861
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be near them.</v>

1862
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 3>But those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that person loses,</v>

1863
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 3>they're the first ones to attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1864
01:13:54.871 --> 01:13:56.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking loser.</v>

1865
01:13:56.101 --> 01:13:58.710
<v Speaker 3>I knew you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you go to Ronda Rousey's a</v>

1866
01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:01.260
<v Speaker 3>instagram page and read the comments</v>
<v Speaker 3>under her pictures.</v>

1867
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.740
<v Speaker 3>It's ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some fucking assholes.</v>

1868
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 3>This assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guarantee you all those people are</v>

1869
01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:13.011
<v Speaker 3>severely unaccomplished or really young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either young kids that don't understand</v>

1870
01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:14.770
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have this opportunity to be</v>

1871
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 3>able to talk shit or they're a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking losers.</v>

1872
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.790
<v Speaker 3>And they're finding this opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit on someone who was this incredible</v>

1873
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.070
<v Speaker 3>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shining star that fizzled out.</v>

1874
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:29.340
<v Speaker 3>So she lost to Holly Holm and then she</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back in a far worst matchup against</v>

1875
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought Nunez before Holly Holm</v>

1876
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:35.460
<v Speaker 3>beat or I thought Nunez was the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous matchup for cause.</v>

1877
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Nunez is a Brazilian Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>black belt and she has heavy,</v>

1878
01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:41.380
<v Speaker 3>heavy hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a dangerous striker and I was like</v>

1879
01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Ron is going to have to close the</v>
<v Speaker 3>distance or to grab her and take her to</v>

1880
01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when she does it's still fucking</v>

1881
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 3>picnic because Amanda Nunez is nasty on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

1882
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.980
<v Speaker 3>And then getting close to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got knockout power with her hands.</v>

1883
01:14:50.981 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm like this is a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible matchup.</v>

1884
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:56.020
<v Speaker 3>And it turned out to be right because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got knocked down 48 seconds and the</v>

1885
01:14:56.021 --> 01:14:59.140
<v Speaker 3>rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what she should've done is revamp or</v>

1886
01:14:59.141 --> 01:15:04.030
<v Speaker 3>camp or not fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>revamp re go to one of the masters.</v>

1887
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:08.230
<v Speaker 3>There's a few masters of mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts in this world is for Rasa Hobby and</v>

1888
01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Matt Hume and Duke Roufus is a few of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these striking mixed martial arts</v>

1889
01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:15.460
<v Speaker 3>masters and you have to go to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to them and you have to</v>

1890
01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 3>like submit yourself and say look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fix this.</v>

1891
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Let's fix whatever I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's see if we can take this to the</v>

1892
01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 3>next level because the sport evolved and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sport pastor by like she was at the</v>

1893
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 3>very top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you build it,</v>

1894
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:30.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like that field of dreams movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you build it,</v>

1895
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:34.690
<v Speaker 3>they will come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when she built the women's Bantam</v>

1896
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Weight Division and became this dominant</v>
<v Speaker 3>force and stopped all these people and</v>

1897
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.410
<v Speaker 3>looked invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those women were coming up below her</v>

1898
01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 3>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were getting better and they were</v>

1899
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 3>evolving and they were like the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>

1900
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.940
<v Speaker 3>they were reaching this incredibly high</v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

1901
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Where's the women's MMA movement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the early days,</v>

1902
01:15:52.150 --> 01:15:52.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1903
01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:54.760
<v Speaker 3>four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watched women's mma,</v>

1904
01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 3>this skill level was nowhere near</v>
<v Speaker 3>commensurate with the men skill level,</v>

1905
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 3>like demand skill level at the three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years ago.</v>

1906
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 3>They're better today but only a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit better.</v>

1907
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.960
<v Speaker 3>But the women are way better today than</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were because it's a new thing.</v>

1908
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like 1997 for mixed martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 3>from men.</v>

1909
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what like three or four years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1910
01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:18.100
<v Speaker 3>but now the women have essentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much caught up or close to it.</v>

1911
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.250
<v Speaker 3>There's very high level striking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high level submissions,</v>

1912
01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 3>very high level fluid overall mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts games that you're seeing in</v>

1913
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 3>the women's division and Rhonda in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways,</v>

1914
01:16:28.691 --> 01:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>a spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

1915
01:16:30.011 --> 01:16:33.100
<v Speaker 3>had a very limited approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't kick,</v>

1916
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 3>she punched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't necessarily like the most</v>

1917
01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:41.290
<v Speaker 3>brutal knockout puncher and she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily the most skillful boxer.</v>

1918
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:43.210
<v Speaker 3>She didn't really have a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of experience.</v>

1919
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.740
<v Speaker 3>What she had was incredible athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a worldclass mindset.</v>

1920
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.750
<v Speaker 3>She was a world class athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1921
01:16:49.751 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 3>she's a former Olympian and outstanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>judo.</v>

1922
01:16:52.751 --> 01:16:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Her judo and our arm bars are amongst</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best in the world.</v>

1923
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:59.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it transitions the way she</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks and attacks and tax and set</v>

1924
01:16:59.321 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 3>things up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's phenomenally talented and you</v>

1925
01:17:02.861 --> 01:17:04.960
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really accomplished in judo.</v>

1926
01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 3>But when you want to be a world mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts champion at the highest</v>

1927
01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 3>level of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have to be great at everything.</v>

1928
01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 3>There's people like Demetrius mighty</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouse Johnson I think is the best</v>

1929
01:17:15.591 --> 01:17:17.240
<v Speaker 3>fighter in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

1930
01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's great at everything and</v>

1931
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:21.800
<v Speaker 3>that's why he's the best cause you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what the fuck he's going to do.</v>

1932
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:25.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't know if he's going to kick you</v>
<v Speaker 3>or knee you or take you down or strangle</v>

1933
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:25.844
<v Speaker 3>you or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1934
01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:27.270
<v Speaker 3>or elbow you.</v>

1935
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.860
<v Speaker 3>And he's just got so many options and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's coming at you from all different</v>

1936
01:17:30.861 --> 01:17:32.780
<v Speaker 3>directions and he never gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1937
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:36.200
<v Speaker 3>he's the total full package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a demetrius mighty mouse,</v>

1938
01:17:36.201 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Johnson and women's mma yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's common.</v>

1939
01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 3>It's common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Brian does not that,</v>

1940
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda is more like maybe like a</v>

1941
01:17:43.911 --> 01:17:47.690
<v Speaker 3>chocolate dell or one of the early</v>
<v Speaker 3>pioneers of men's mma.</v>

1942
01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Super talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fun to watch,</v>

1943
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:54.860
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps limited in their approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to enjoy,</v>

1944
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy mighty mouse.</v>

1945
01:17:55.941 --> 01:17:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Now that you mentioned you met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's incredible.</v>

1946
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.050
<v Speaker 3>He's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1947
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many of them now.</v>

1948
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just this sport is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>exploding and it's exploding with towels</v>

1949
01:18:05.021 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 3>and changed his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sold well.</v>

1950
01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:09.470
<v Speaker 3>It has a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to like refine itself I</v>

1951
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:11.570
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the guys who sold it or the guys who</v>

1952
01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 3>bought it rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1953
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're savvy,</v>

1954
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:17.900
<v Speaker 3>intelligent dudes who are trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it their way and there's going to be</v>

1955
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.040
<v Speaker 3>some bumps along the way.</v>

1956
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.780
<v Speaker 3>There's Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've made a lot of changes and</v>

1957
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to do some things</v>
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

1958
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:26.000
<v Speaker 3>And some of the things I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like now I have a three man booth,</v>

1959
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 3>like it's me and a fighter and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>play by play commentator,</v>

1960
01:18:29.631 --> 01:18:31.760
<v Speaker 3>which we've done a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think is really good.</v>

1961
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm there.</v>

1962
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:38.690
<v Speaker 3>They've got a lot of match ups that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>fallen through unfortunately because of</v>

1963
01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:40.790
<v Speaker 3>weight cut issues and a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1964
01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:43.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's a tough business man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to be a promoter.</v>

1965
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do is easy.</v>

1966
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I just show up and things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about the things that are</v>

1967
01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a lot,</v>

1968
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to do a lot of work to get</v>

1969
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:53.564
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1970
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I just kind of get there and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch and I talk about the fights.</v>

1971
01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:00.710
<v Speaker 3>That promoting angle of it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably brutal.</v>

1972
01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:02.730
<v Speaker 3>You have to rely on so many people to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>their job.</v>

1973
01:19:02.731 --> 01:19:04.190
<v Speaker 3>So many people that have their shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

1974
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:08.480
<v Speaker 3>you've got to rely on these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive maniacs known as MMA fighters.</v>

1975
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:12.050
<v Speaker 3>They get their weight in order and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have their camp go through without</v>

1976
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:15.830
<v Speaker 3>severely injuring themselves and to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>things smartly and intelligently and</v>

1977
01:19:15.831 --> 01:19:20.180
<v Speaker 3>conservatively so that they can show up</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the dance and be able to perform at</v>

1978
01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:21.170
<v Speaker 3>their best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1979
01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:21.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1980
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:23.870
<v Speaker 3>you're asking a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different people and most of</v>

1981
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 3>them come through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1982
01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 3>most fighters are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional.</v>

1983
01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of them don't like that.</v>

1984
01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Habib number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>madoff,</v>

1985
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson fight that fell through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks ago or last week.</v>

1986
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just devastating that were,</v>

1987
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were all ready for that fight.</v>

1988
01:19:37.411 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 3>And then in the day of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he can't make it the day of the</v>

1989
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>weigh ins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather he can't make the weight and they</v>

1990
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.990
<v Speaker 3>send him to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those kinds of things do happen.</v>

1991
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 3>These guys that are running it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wme guys,</v>

1992
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're smart as hell.</v>

1993
01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 3>So we'll just see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll figure it out.</v>

1994
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:53.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they'll,</v>

1995
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.690
<v Speaker 3>he'll take a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be,</v>

1996
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a little bit of trial and</v>
<v Speaker 3>error.</v>

1997
01:19:58.190 --> 01:19:59.360
<v Speaker 3>Just understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1998
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.030
<v Speaker 3>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they spent 4 billion on the UFC.</v>

1999
01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:03.320
<v Speaker 3>They're going to want it run it their</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2000
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible investment.</v>

2001
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the fuck they're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make that money back.</v>

2002
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:09.990
<v Speaker 1>You're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a smart financial guy.</v>

2003
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.220
<v Speaker 1>How the hell they make that money back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2004
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Pena.</v>

2005
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Not likely.</v>

2006
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:19.623
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2007
01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the way I would do it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take it public.</v>

2008
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>

2009
01:20:24.421 --> 01:20:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I need to know where you heard it here</v>
<v Speaker 1>first on Joe Show,</v>

2010
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:33.590
<v Speaker 1>take it public and they that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make 50% on their money in a week.</v>

2011
01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean a week after they take it public</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the uh,</v>

2012
01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the average investor pays up to much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay up high multiples.</v>

2013
01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between a non a</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid investment and a liquid</v>

2014
01:20:46.921 --> 01:20:49.140
<v Speaker 1>investment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiples are normally 50 to a</v>

2015
01:20:49.141 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just asked me talk Chinese if he's,</v>

2016
01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say they bought it at 20</v>

2017
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>times earnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2018
01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Forbidden Equated to 20 times earnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2019
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:02.320
<v Speaker 1>20 Times per annual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2020
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:03.270
<v Speaker 1>that's correct.</v>

2021
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:04.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2022
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 1>they take it public and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the investment public,</v>

2023
01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:09.360
<v Speaker 1>the schmucks that buy stocks on the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York Stock Exchange,</v>

2024
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:11.150
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you 40 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>

2025
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they do that,</v>

2026
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem with taking things</v>

2027
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:19.110
<v Speaker 1>pulling out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose control depending on how much</v>

2028
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:20.580
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of the stock are they going to</v>

2029
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:22.710
<v Speaker 1>sell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to sell 10%.</v>

2030
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 1>They're certainly not gonna sell 50.1%</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then they lose total control.</v>

2031
01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:30.570
<v Speaker 1>But then there also have to adhere to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the SEC Securities Exchange Commission.</v>

2032
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:32.820
<v Speaker 1>There's rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2033
01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:35.610
<v Speaker 1>and they got to have to have audited</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements every,</v>

2034
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:37.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every 90 days.</v>

2035
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And if there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2036
01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:43.020
<v Speaker 1>if they gave you too much money for</v>
<v Speaker 1>expenses and it's down there as a</v>

2037
01:21:43.021 --> 01:21:44.010
<v Speaker 1>footnote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come.</v>

2038
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.170
<v Speaker 1>They come and investigate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you get Rogan that?</v>

2039
01:21:46.171 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do that most people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go public because of that?</v>

2040
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I went public because I could see that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to make a thousand times my</v>

2041
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:55.890
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2042
01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:58.770
<v Speaker 1>not even 100,000 times my money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a no brainer.</v>

2043
01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.770
<v Speaker 1>We made 100,000 times your money by</v>
<v Speaker 1>going public.</v>

2044
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:02.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2045
01:22:02.511 --> 01:22:06.180
<v Speaker 1>what's he actually better than that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>$1 million a year off your podcast.</v>

2094
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2097
01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.940
<v Speaker 2>now you want to take it public and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to take it public on one of the</v>

2098
01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 2>secondary tertiary exchanges because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2099
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.050
<v Speaker 2>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be big enough to take on the</v>

2100
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.790
<v Speaker 2>New York Stock Exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2101
01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to sell shares in your baby?</v>

2102
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.820
<v Speaker 2>A $4,000 a share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2103
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.570
<v Speaker 2>How many shares does one half?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2104
01:24:25.571 --> 01:24:27.320
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been used one if you want to.</v>

2105
01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 2>So he can make 100 million shares with</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,000 a share.</v>

2106
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:30.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2107
01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't equate that much value,</v>

2108
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 2>but you could do a thousand chairs at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand,</v>

2109
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:37.770
<v Speaker 2>$1,000 a share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2110
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.613
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2111
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And so you sell 20% off to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 20% of those shares are,</v>

2112
01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:45.640
<v Speaker 2>and I mean you've got millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that follow you.</v>

2113
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a slam dunk.</v>

2114
01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a no brainer.</v>

2115
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:51.940
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's done a bunch of people be telling</v>

2116
01:24:51.941 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 2>me to who I know as long as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to keep control,</v>

2117
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:56.620
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2118
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.310
<v Speaker 2>they would try to get that power though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got where they would,</v>

2119
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:03.760
<v Speaker 2>but as long as you held or your group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your consortium or you and your,</v>

2120
01:25:03.761 --> 01:25:07.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your buddies held more than 50%,</v>

2121
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 2>they could never take control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like that's,</v>

2122
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.040
<v Speaker 2>that's where hostile takeovers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

2123
01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:12.874
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2124
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:15.580
<v Speaker 2>People gather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started there.</v>

2125
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting excited myself.</v>

2126
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2127
01:25:18.051 --> 01:25:20.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll take over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>

2128
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll meet in the cage.</v>

2129
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.140
<v Speaker 2>You can put your best guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put my best gun,</v>

2130
01:25:25.150 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 2>then we'll settle it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like they do in the old days,</v>

2131
01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the two armies going to war</v>

2132
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.080
<v Speaker 2>the best night from this guy and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best night from this guy.</v>

2133
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Who would you pick the defense to defend</v>
<v Speaker 2>your honor.</v>

2134
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 2>My arm and the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you get the other side,</v>

2135
01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.410
<v Speaker 2>had a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would you pick?</v>

2136
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we doing wait clauses?</v>

2137
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:44.831
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2140
01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:50.650
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2156
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:22.600

<v Speaker 1>he had beaten up lesnar pretty bad,</v>

2157
01:26:22.601 --> 01:26:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still win the fight that guy</v>

<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>

2162
01:26:28.921 --> 01:26:32.190
<v Speaker 3>But he gassed out and then brock</v>
<v Speaker 3>survived and strangled him in a second</v>

2163
01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:37.170
<v Speaker 3>at Brock's a tough guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just was a guy who got into mma very</v>

2164
01:26:37.171 --> 01:26:40.950
<v Speaker 3>late in life and wasn't a natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>striker and really didn't have the,</v>

2165
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>the natural striking capability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not when I say natural,</v>

2166
01:26:44.161 --> 01:26:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean like fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2167
01:26:46.621 --> 01:26:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>effortless striking that you get when</v>

2168
01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:50.910
<v Speaker 3>you've been doing it for years and years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and years.</v>

2169
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.560
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the hardest things to</v>

2170
01:26:52.561 --> 01:26:55.440
<v Speaker 3>learn as guys get older when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in their thirties.</v>

2171
01:26:55.441 --> 01:26:58.320
<v Speaker 3>And then learning how to strike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning how to strike against someone</v>

2172
01:26:58.321 --> 01:27:01.170
<v Speaker 3>who's really seasoned and good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just going to be these openings</v>

2173
01:27:01.171 --> 01:27:03.240
<v Speaker 3>and it just takes a few shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2174
01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:03.841
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

2175
01:27:03.841 --> 01:27:06.480
<v Speaker 3>get in and all of a sudden you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>diminished in the leg kick and then the</v>

2176
01:27:06.481 --> 01:27:08.100
<v Speaker 3>fucking shot to the body and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>

2177
01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.110
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw what happened when he fought</v>

2178
01:27:10.111 --> 01:27:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Cain Velasquez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cain just overwhelmed them.</v>

2179
01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.790
<v Speaker 3>It just so much better with striking and</v>
<v Speaker 3>really grit,</v>

2180
01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:17.700
<v Speaker 3>great at wrestling as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So cain was able to get back up on its</v>

2181
01:27:17.701 --> 01:27:20.070
<v Speaker 3>feet when brock took them down and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>just brought,</v>

2182
01:27:20.071 --> 01:27:22.380
<v Speaker 3>could not handle the onslaught that</v>
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>

2183
01:27:22.381 --> 01:27:26.490
<v Speaker 3>was putting on him on the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wasn't prepared for it correctly.</v>

2184
01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:30.540
<v Speaker 3>You need years and years and years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>striking training and you need to spar</v>

2185
01:27:30.541 --> 01:27:32.300
<v Speaker 3>lightly and you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2186
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you need to develop fluidity and you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your movements,</v>

2187
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you need to have efficient striking</v>
<v Speaker 3>mood.</v>

2188
01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Now what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2189

2229
01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2230
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:12.840
<v Speaker 2>There's some people who have had</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries out there that says there's a</v>

2231
01:29:12.841 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 2>few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>few people that fell off the back of a</v>

2232
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:18.460
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle and the little girl booby</v>
<v Speaker 2>wound,</v>

2233
01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:23.740
<v Speaker 2>well it's all on Prague was number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is soon when they come down they</v>

2234
01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.730
<v Speaker 2>the the the runway amp and the fire and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

2235
01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Speaker 2>And then when they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be good,</v>

2236
01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:33.160
<v Speaker 2>good athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

2237
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:36.330
<v Speaker 2>When they bounce their heads and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things you hit him with chairs</v>

2238
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely good athletes.</v>

2239
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Does the guys are outstanding athletes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a fucking really hard way to</v>

2241
01:29:42.101 --> 01:29:44.440
<v Speaker 3>make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean w whatever it say,</v>

2242
01:29:44.441 --> 01:29:46.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you want about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>being choreographed.</v>

2243
01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:50.350
<v Speaker 3>They're still picking each other up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>slamming each other on the ground.</v>

2244
01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:53.560
<v Speaker 3>And hitting each other and it's got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt after a few weeks,</v>

2245
01:29:53.561 --> 01:29:54.430
<v Speaker 3>few months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>few years,</v>

2246
01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:56.710
<v Speaker 3>not only down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are on the road,</v>

2247
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:59.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 plus days a year doing that.</v>

2248
01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:03.760
<v Speaker 3>So it is a absolutely brutal business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard way to make a living and</v>

2249
01:30:03.761 --> 01:30:05.350
<v Speaker 3>they are tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough guys.</v>

2250
01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.650
<v Speaker 3>So they might not be really competing</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an MMA fighter is,</v>

2251
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.080
<v Speaker 3>but there's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have my respect.</v>

2252
01:30:11.081 --> 01:30:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough way to make a living.</v>

2253
01:30:13.991 --> 01:30:17.530
<v Speaker 3>They are earning their money and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it in a way where most</v>

2254
01:30:17.531 --> 01:30:19.180
<v Speaker 3>people don't even see them earn their</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2255
01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.550
<v Speaker 3>They mean they're out in these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these arenas.</v>

2256
01:30:21.551 --> 01:30:21.911
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2257
01:30:21.911 --> 01:30:24.760
<v Speaker 3>they're playing this state and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>state and they're going on the road and</v>

2258
01:30:24.761 --> 01:30:27.670
<v Speaker 3>they're slamming each other and throwing</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other into the turnbuckle and</v>

2259
01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:30.700
<v Speaker 3>elbowing each other in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard,</v>

2260
01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a hard way to make a living.</v>

2261
01:30:33.311 --> 01:30:37.690
<v Speaker 3>And a giant percentage of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>wind up having problems with pain pills,</v>

2262
01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:41.170
<v Speaker 3>severe pain and their body always</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly,</v>

2263
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back injuries,</v>

2264
01:30:42.401 --> 01:30:43.900
<v Speaker 3>knee injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck injuries,</v>

2265
01:30:43.901 --> 01:30:44.740
<v Speaker 3>elbow injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2266
01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:47.830
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking brutal way to get paid.</v>

2267
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Now are the a mea guys getting paid big</v>
<v Speaker 3>money now?</v>

2268
01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:55.660
<v Speaker 3>The best of the best are the guys like</v>
<v Speaker 3>conor Mcgregor and conor mcgregor.</v>

2269
01:30:55.661 --> 01:30:57.130
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people that fight conor</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor,</v>

2270
01:30:57.131 --> 01:30:58.600
<v Speaker 3>they're making millions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronda Rousey,</v>

2271
01:30:58.601 --> 01:31:00.520
<v Speaker 3>she's making millions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2272
01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:03.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's taken a while for the people that</v>

2273
01:31:03.941 --> 01:31:07.810
<v Speaker 3>are not known very well to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make that kind of money.</v>

2274
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

2275
01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:10.180
<v Speaker 3>they're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
01:31:10.181 --> 01:31:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for the average journeyman</v>

2277
01:31:12.881 --> 01:31:16.450
<v Speaker 3>fighter to not just pay their bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to put money away as well.</v>

2278
01:31:16.451 --> 01:31:17.284
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2279
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's like that in boxing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what people don't understand.</v>

2280
01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Boxing like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

2281
01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:23.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>floyd mayweather made $40 million for</v>

2282
01:31:23.771 --> 01:31:25.420
<v Speaker 3>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he did,</v>

2283
01:31:25.570 --> 01:31:28.360
<v Speaker 3>but floyd mayweather's one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one floyd mayweather.</v>

2284
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Gennady Golovkin can't sell 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper view bys.</v>

2285
01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.540
<v Speaker 3>And he's the one of the best fighters in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world today.</v>

2286
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:36.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vassily Limit Chanko same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2288
01:31:38.531 --> 01:31:40.660
<v Speaker 3>He's not making the kind of money to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conor Mcgregor's making.</v>

2289
01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.920
<v Speaker 3>So what boxing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like you see these very big marquee</v>

<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2293
01:31:52.421 --> 01:31:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Like Manny Pacquiao has made more money</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the best UFC guys.</v>

2294
01:31:55.511 --> 01:31:57.850
<v Speaker 3>But conor mcgregor is nipping at their</v>
<v Speaker 3>heels right now.</v>

2322
01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:01.330
<v Speaker 2>some would consider maybe like there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people that are more sensitive that</v>

2323
01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:03.190
<v Speaker 2>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's distasteful thing to even</v>

<v Speaker 2>significant challenge when your life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimately on the line.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just do.</v>

2332
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:28.750
<v Speaker 2>They just do that just to find out who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really are versus who you're</v>

2333
01:33:28.751 --> 01:33:30.040

01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I've had this conversation with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>before because you know,</v>

2366
01:34:53.831 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 2>if you have anybody on a podcast that</v>

2367
01:34:56.741 --> 01:34:58.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the saying anything controversial,</v>

2368
01:34:58.641 --> 01:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>like you're saying about global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>

01:35:02.571 --> 01:35:05.230
<v Speaker 2>denier on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not a climate change denier,</v>

2371
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 2>which you're saying is that it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated effect that human beings</v>

2372
01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:09.260
<v Speaker 2>have had.</v>

2373
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:11.480
<v Speaker 2>And regardless of whether or not we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>that effect at all,</v>

2374
01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.580
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like the end of the Ice</v>

<v Speaker 2>the box,</v>

2574
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've talked about,</v>

2575
01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.750
<v Speaker 2>we've talked briefly about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2576
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.390
<v Speaker 2>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus,</v>

2577
01:43:10.530 --> 01:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>hard work discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:12.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

2579
01:43:12.891 --> 01:43:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I made this country great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what makes people great.</v>

2580
01:43:15.330 --> 01:43:15.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2581
01:43:15.991 --> 01:43:18.540
<v Speaker 2>well people make a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comfort is not what makes people great.</v>

2582
01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.800
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2583
01:43:19.801 --> 01:43:20.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2584
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:23.160
<v Speaker 2>getting out of your comfort zone is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that millennials have such a hard</v>

2585
01:43:23.161 --> 01:43:23.911
<v Speaker 2>time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2586
01:43:23.911 --> 01:43:26.880
<v Speaker 2>They're all sitting on the couch playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games and Fox still limited food</v>

2587
01:43:26.881 --> 01:43:28.680
<v Speaker 2>delivered 34 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2588
01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2589
01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.460
<v Speaker 2>When I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get out of the house quick</v>

2590
01:43:32.461 --> 01:43:35.070
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that that's sort of</v>

2591
01:43:35.071 --> 01:43:37.770
<v Speaker 2>like what we always expect from the fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>of civilizations?</v>

2592
01:43:37.771 --> 01:43:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we always were taught about</v>

2593
01:43:39.211 --> 01:43:39.811
<v Speaker 2>Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2594
01:43:39.811 --> 01:43:42.930
<v Speaker 2>That Rome got to be incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>gluttonous and then it all collapsed the</v>

2595
01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:44.540
<v Speaker 2>way it's on bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2596
01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:45.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of like,</v>

2597
01:43:45.930 --> 01:43:49.740
<v Speaker 2>you don't think that's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the u s or it's America right now?</v>

2598
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't more.</v>

2599
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 2>But do you think it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be changed?</v>

2600
01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Can it be turned around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Be changed.</v>

2601
01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:57.010
<v Speaker 2>If we want to do it bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to pay the price to</v>

2602
01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be painful.</v>

2603
01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people just need to understand</v>

2604
01:44:01.271 --> 01:44:04.450
<v Speaker 3>that there's consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's consequences that you pay to</v>

2605
01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:09.070
<v Speaker 3>constantly seeking comfort and avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 3>discomfort and avoiding hard work.</v>

2606
01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:11.710
<v Speaker 3>And those consequences are you never</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to feel self realized.</v>

2607
01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.780
<v Speaker 3>He never going to feel like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplished anything.</v>

2608
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.640
<v Speaker 3>He never going to have this feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that difficulty and</v>

2609
01:44:18.641 --> 01:44:21.550
<v Speaker 3>struggle and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ability to push through that is</v>

2610
01:44:21.551 --> 01:44:24.340
<v Speaker 3>a muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you develop that muscle by doing it.</v>

2611
01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.770
<v Speaker 3>And once you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop a lot of self satisfaction</v>

2612
01:44:26.771 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 3>and you develop peace of mind and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand that you can overcome</v>

2613
01:44:30.611 --> 01:44:33.010
<v Speaker 3>obstacles if you don't have to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 3>obstacles.</v>

2614
01:44:33.011 --> 01:44:35.500
<v Speaker 3>You never know whether or not you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you were talking about with</v>

2615
01:44:35.501 --> 01:44:38.200
<v Speaker 3>trigger time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you were faced with actual</v>

2616
01:44:38.201 --> 01:44:40.150
<v Speaker 3>adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand how you're going to</v>

2617
01:44:40.151 --> 01:44:43.240
<v Speaker 3>feel and how you're gonna react when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome that adversity.</v>

2618

<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to say,</v>

2654
01:45:56.831 --> 01:45:59.170
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck were you doing when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were giving away free money?</v>

2655
01:45:59.710 --> 01:46:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally the people that are listening</v>

2656
01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:05.420
<v Speaker 2>to this 20 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their children and grandchildren are</v>

2657
01:46:05.421 --> 01:46:06.670
<v Speaker 2>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandma,</v>

2658
01:46:06.671 --> 01:46:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck were you doing other than</v>

2659
01:46:08.591 --> 01:46:11.770
<v Speaker 2>having your thumb up your ass during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>period of free money?</v>

2660
01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:13.270
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say interest rates are free,</v>

2661
01:46:13.271 --> 01:46:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you talking about business loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

2662
01:46:15.970 --> 01:46:16.803
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2663
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it's never going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2664
01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:20.860
<v Speaker 2>it can only go up from here.</v>

2665
01:46:20.890 --> 01:46:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2666
01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:24.700
<v Speaker 2>yellen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of the Fed Federal Reserve has</v>

2667
01:46:24.701 --> 01:46:27.100
<v Speaker 2>already up to him once and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

2668
01:46:27.101 --> 01:46:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I guess she's going to have a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>more times,</v>

2669
01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.910
<v Speaker 2>but historically interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which tried to be eight,</v>

2670
01:46:30.911 --> 01:46:31.744
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>

2671
01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:33.220
<v Speaker 2>not two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

2672
01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:37.540
<v Speaker 2>If you can't make a business proposition</v>
<v Speaker 2>work at two or 3% interest.</v>

2673
01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.190
<v Speaker 2>So you pay one or two points over that</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the vigorous or the interest</v>

2674
01:46:42.191 --> 01:46:45.940
<v Speaker 2>that they get you out to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm only mean this metaphorically</v>

2675
01:46:45.941 --> 01:46:48.190
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ought to swallow a fucking revolver.</v>

2677
01:46:52.891 --> 01:46:54.930
<v Speaker 2>make money now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ought to jump in front of a bus.</v>

2678
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Now when you go and do these seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like finally give him at the council.</v>

2679
01:46:59.431 --> 01:47:01.020

<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2680
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I stopped that in 2000 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to when the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But you just did this speech or speech,</v>

2682
01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they'd call it a solid that the</v>

2683
01:47:12.631 --> 01:47:13.100
<v Speaker 2>right word.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Solid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2687
01:47:16.411 --> 01:47:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a favor for the guy,</v>

2688
01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.520
<v Speaker 2>but so the seminars are only at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>castle,</v>

2689
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:22.380
<v Speaker 2>we will have to come to your castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2690
01:47:22.381 --> 01:47:23.700
<v Speaker 2>And when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what do you,</v>

2692
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:29.700
<v Speaker 2>About 120 pages of copious paperwork on</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2693
01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Psychological profiles and much of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2694
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.980
<v Speaker 2>And do you have someone go over that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you go with that?</v>

2695
01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have many people do you do this with</v>

2696
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:39.000
<v Speaker 2>20 to 24 per seminar.</v>

<v Speaker 2>how many days is the seminar?</v>

2698
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.573
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2699
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I have to dress in a</v>

2700
01:47:44.251 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 2>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to dress in a suit and the suit</v>

2701

<v Speaker 2>and you have to start at eight in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and it goes til midnight.</v>

2702
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you basically go on to sleep,</v>

2703
01:47:51.751 --> 01:47:52.980
<v Speaker 2>getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work again?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have two gymnasiums at the castle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't use the gymnasium unless</v>

2708
01:48:00.811 --> 01:48:03.310
<v Speaker 2>they earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to earn it.</v>

2709

<v Speaker 2>Most people are not successful.</v>

2725
01:48:41.341 --> 01:48:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Not because they run out of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial bank account.</v>

2726
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 2>They're not successful because they went</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the emotional bank account.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he had a closing.</v>

2867
01:54:06.630 --> 01:54:11.350

2868
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:14.070
<v Speaker 1>days ago and sally and I were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you close it financial,</v>

2869
01:54:14.071 --> 01:54:17.970
<v Speaker 1>do you have to have two sources of id</v>
<v Speaker 1>now because of money laundering,</v>

2870
01:54:17.971 --> 01:54:20.040
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a passport.</v>

2871
01:54:20.670 --> 01:54:25.410
<v Speaker 1>A second source of ID was a driver's</v>
<v Speaker 1>permit because he's not old enough to</v>

2872
01:54:25.411 --> 01:54:30.411
<v Speaker 1>have a driver's license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a driver's permit and a passport.</v>

01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:35.300
<v Speaker 1>He did a $3 million deal.</v>

2874
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.020
<v Speaker 1>he's a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why teenagers do better is</v>

2875
01:54:39.021 --> 01:54:40.940
<v Speaker 1>because they have less baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2876
01:54:40.941 --> 01:54:44.330
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't had as much life wearing</v>

2877
01:54:44.331 --> 01:54:46.460
<v Speaker 1>them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as much scar tissue,</v>

2878
01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.290
<v Speaker 1>scar tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar tissue.</v>

2879
01:54:48.291 --> 01:54:49.270
<v Speaker 1>That's real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2880
01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:52.400
<v Speaker 1>If you take a kid 18 it's got physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>

2881
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you can train him into being in a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably easier than you take a 38 year</v>

2882
01:54:56.661 --> 01:54:57.410
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

2883

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2884
01:54:58.190 --> 01:54:59.570
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost impossible.</v>

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

2908
01:55:45.301 --> 01:55:48.210
<v Speaker 2>that was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of two broken legs I've ever</v>

2909
01:55:48.211 --> 01:55:50.880
<v Speaker 2>seen like that live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him on videos before,</v>

2910
01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but being there live here at snap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not hear it snap,</v>

2911
01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.760
<v Speaker 2>but I saw a give out and I saw him fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2912
01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was the first time I'd ever seen</v>

2913
01:55:58.861 --> 01:56:02.130
<v Speaker 2>it was a guy named Corey Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He threw this kick and the same thing is</v>

2914
01:56:02.131 --> 01:56:02.791
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kicked,</v>

2915
01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:05.460
<v Speaker 2>got checked and his legs just snapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>out from under him.</v>

2916
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>And that time that the referee didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it,</v>

2917
01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.590
<v Speaker 2>the referee didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy had a broken leg and we were</v>

2918
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>screaming at the referee to stop the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2919
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:15.960
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at Mike Tyson's,</v>

2920
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:17.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you win the championship in</v>

2921
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:20.840
<v Speaker 2>bringing really wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was in the third row and uh,</v>

2922
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Deniro and a bunch of Italian guys were</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind me Devito and he was,</v>

2923
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:28.290
<v Speaker 2>well he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that lost that,</v>

2924
01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.730
<v Speaker 2>he looked like he was going to lose.</v>

2925
01:56:29.730 --> 01:56:33.870
<v Speaker 2>He looked afraid at Tyson and Tyson was</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting him with such velocity.</v>

2926
01:56:33.871 --> 01:56:38.871
<v Speaker 2>The perspiration on the guys head was</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying over the first two rows on to me</v>

2927
01:56:39.121 --> 01:56:41.370
<v Speaker 2>in the third bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was hitting like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>illustrated.</v>

2932

2953
01:57:35.041 --> 01:57:37.190

<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>

2957
01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:46.320
<v Speaker 2>And he said something about white</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2958
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So I had been tuned up pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then back in [inaudible] 78,</v>

2959
01:57:49.951 --> 01:57:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was pretty tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stood up and I said something back to</v>

2960
01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:55.440
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this went over like a Turd in a</v>

2961
01:57:55.441 --> 01:57:56.880
<v Speaker 2>punch bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2962
01:57:56.950 --> 01:58:01.950

<v Speaker 2>And so I go,</v>

2965
01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:10.640
<v Speaker 2>and then Muhammad Ali was sitting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>six tables over and he protected me.</v>

2966
01:58:11.070 --> 01:58:13.200
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to let this white boy alone.</v>

2967
01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want a problem here.</v>

2968
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:16.290
<v Speaker 2>So then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2969
01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:17.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
