<v Speaker 2>It's Alonzo Boden,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know Joe.</v>

31
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:46.781
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

32
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 2>ever since Obama took over,</v>

33
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean he gave me a call.</v>

34
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:50.261
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

35
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 2>look alive,</v>

36
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 2>so we need a brother on the weather.</v>

37
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:52.091
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

38
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

39
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

40
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 2>So this is part of that whole thing.</v>

41
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's part of like black lives matter.</v>

42
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I just want to let you in.</v>

43
00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

44
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

45
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

46
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.803
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

47
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

48
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you gotta do what you gotta do in this crazy world.</v>

49
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 2>And a little weather modification is on the menu.</v>

50
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

52
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.431
<v Speaker 2>then I'm kicking,</v>

54
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting some of the ski resort money from mammoth.</v>

55
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

56
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 2>that's like a side hustle.</v>

57
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Speaker 2>They say this winter is going to be fucking crazy.</v>

58
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>The weather modification experts.</v>

59
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm just here to let you know El Nino,</v>

60
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in an El Nino?</v>

61
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.973
<v Speaker 2>But is that real?</v>

62
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

63
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.244
<v Speaker 2>I think that is,</v>

64
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.671
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

65
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:25.504
<v Speaker 2>but whether,</v>

66
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 2>you know what's so funny about the weather?</v>

67
00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:28.024
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

68
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 2>they really don't know it at best it's an educated guess.</v>

69
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

70
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 2>So when they say something like there's a change in an ocean current,</v>

71
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>like that's what El Nino is,</v>

72
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

73
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Like there's warm water flowing through the ocean where it's normally cold and</v>

74
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 2>that's going to bring more water vapor.</v>

75
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 2>And I get that on the large scale,</v>

76
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 2>but they can never say,</v>

77
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:51.761
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

78
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 2>it's going to rain Tuesday between noon and four o'clock.</v>

79
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Like th there are times when they're so wrong.</v>

80
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.171
<v Speaker 2>It's comical.</v>

81
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Like in any other job you'd be fired for being that far off and they're like,</v>

82
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

83
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.603
<v Speaker 2>we missed.</v>

84
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 2>But compared to like how they used to be,</v>

85
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking amazing when they used to just look up at the sky and when there</v>

86
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 2>are clouds are running well we better get inside.</v>

87
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

88
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 2>They knew a tornado was coming cause you could see the tornado coming like that</v>

90
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:22.924
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

91
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

93
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 2>but then you have the other things like a,</v>

94
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 2>in Phoenix they have whether people,</v>

95
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Like what is your job from April through November in Phoenix.</v>

97
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.050

<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

108
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

137
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 2>think of 300 different ways to say partly cloudy in the morning,</v>

<v Speaker 2>sunny in the afternoon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a lot of time to write jokes.</v>

00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.001
<v Speaker 2>the club,</v>

151
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.834

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

154
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Like it's an instant recognition kind of Gig.</v>

155
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 2>But he's got to like keep it super clean,</v>

157
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

158
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

159
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.361

00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he's nice.</v>

161
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.243
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

162
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're a weather guy or a news guy.</v>

163
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 2>just straight slightly outside the lines,</v>

166
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 2>people are looking at take you down,</v>

167
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 2>but they still do it.</v>

168
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.761
<v Speaker 2>That's what's funny.</v>

169
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:06.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>You always hear about the,</v>

171
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:12.961
<v Speaker 2>the little small town where the guy that was in some weird thing like got caught</v>

172
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>with a prostitute at a massage.</v>

173
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.413
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>

174
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

175
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.741
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

176
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:18.150
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

177
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.983
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

178
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but when you know you're that guy,</v>

179
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.571
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

180
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you like gave that up,</v>

181
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.641
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

182
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:25.121
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

183
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

184
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to do that.</v>

185
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 2>You won't get crazy.</v>

186
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

187
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:28.421
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

188
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

189
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be on TV every day so I can't,</v>

190
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I got to give up the hookers and blow.</v>

192
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>You're not in the paid off.</v>

194
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

195
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

196
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're even a comic or a comic,</v>

197
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

198
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 2>We can get busted.</v>

199
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And just you now you have a new bit,</v>

201
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 2>like you can't exactly hymns.</v>

202
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

203
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of that.</v>

204
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what a comic could do.</v>

205
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I guess violence would be the only thing unforgivable for a comic.</v>

206
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to like sex scandals or you know,</v>

207
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 2>cheating on your wife or,</v>

208
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 2>or drunk at the airport or whatever,</v>

209
00:04:58.961 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 2>like for comics,</v>

210
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

211
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.491
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

212
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 2>well just makes it better.</v>

213
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.913
<v Speaker 2>He's</v>

214
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

215
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>more material like looking at Kat Williams,</v>

216
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.901
<v Speaker 2>look at Kat Williams,</v>

217
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 2>last special half of the special was all this shit that he got arrested for over</v>

218
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 2>the last two years.</v>

219
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

221
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

222
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.433
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

223
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.281
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

224
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.001
<v Speaker 2>that's a trip.</v>

225
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Like I worked on this cruise line and they said,</v>

226
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

227
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.491
<v Speaker 2>cat came,</v>

228
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 2>but he had a gun.</v>

229
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.611
<v Speaker 2>And you're just like,</v>

230
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

231
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 2>You brought a gun to a cruise ship?</v>

232
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

233
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 2>What did you expect to happen on a cruise ship?</v>

234
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

235
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe somebody could throw him off.</v>

236
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what freaked me out about a crew shot.</v>

237
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Somebody throwing you off because that has happened.</v>

238
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Like some guy through his wife off and he's like,</v>

239
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:42.191
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

240
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:42.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>

241
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>She was young,</v>

242
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>she went out to get a drink and then,</v>

243
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.653
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

245
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.931
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

246
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

247
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 2>It was like the reaction the guy had to his wife falling over more,</v>

248
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 2>the crocodile tears and they were like,</v>

249
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:53.314
<v Speaker 2>okay dude,</v>

250
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.513
<v Speaker 2>how was he?</v>

251
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.060
<v Speaker 2>This is a question.</v>

252
00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 2>So how,</v>

253
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>how will you,</v>

254
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.521
<v Speaker 3>and Debbie,</v>

255
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 3>how are you guys getting along?</v>

256
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.913
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

257
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I guess fight a lot.</v>

258
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I do these charter cruises,</v>

259
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 3>jazz cruises and stuff,</v>

260
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

261
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 3>after the cruise,</v>

262
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 3>the guy who runs it will tell some of the funny stories of what happened while</v>

263
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>we were at sea and on one cruise,</v>

264
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:18.671
<v Speaker 3>newlyweds get into a fight the first night she threw all of his clothes</v>

265
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.514
<v Speaker 3>overboard,</v>

266
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 3>everything of his thrown overboard dad to bring him to the ship's store and he</v>

267
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:24.921
<v Speaker 3>had to wear,</v>

268
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:25.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

269
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:30.161
<v Speaker 3>they sell like the little shorts and Polo shirts from the cruise line and he had</v>

270
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 3>to wear that all week.</v>

271
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

272
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I hope he stayed with her,</v>

273
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.763
<v Speaker 3>I hope.</v>

274
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

275
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it worked out in the long run.</v>

276
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 3>The crews little throwing clothes overboard.</v>

277
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I hope it didn't wreck a beautiful future relationship.</v>

278
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful matrimony,</v>

279
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 3>beautiful nuptials in the Lord's eyes.</v>

280
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 3>You had to know that was in her though,</v>

281
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.294
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

282
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.141
<v Speaker 3>You'd never know,</v>

283
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:54.441
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

284
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:54.591
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

285
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I've met people that got married and then immediately afterwards there checked</v>

286
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.014
<v Speaker 3>became a nightmare.</v>

287
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

288
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

289
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

290
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that more than I've heard.</v>

291
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.401
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

292
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I've heard some things but not,</v>

293
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
<v Speaker 3>but like to that extent I would think that'd be flashes of psycho prior to that</v>

294
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

295
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.191
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

296
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 3>My Buddy said when his girl got pregnant,</v>

297
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 3>like she was a little irritable because you know she was pregnant,</v>

298
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:19.611
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

299
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 3>but then after the baby came like the whole,</v>

300
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 3>once she realized that he was never going to leave,</v>

301
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 3>cause he loves the baby and he loves,</v>

302
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.720
<v Speaker 3>he loves that,</v>

303
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

304
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.611
<v Speaker 3>having a family.</v>

305
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 3>She just started ordering them around,</v>

306
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.513
<v Speaker 3>yelling at him,</v>

307
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 3>barking orders on and telling him what he can and can't do now.</v>

308
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.391
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

309
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck happened to you?</v>

310
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Like we're the same people.</v>

311
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 3>We just have a baby now.</v>

312
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 3>But in your mind,</v>

313
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

314
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 3>the relationships change.</v>

315
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to reorganize and restructure this deal.</v>

316
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to sit down and uh,</v>

317
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.341
<v Speaker 3>this is how it's going to go.</v>

318
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:50.031
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm ready to go.</v>

319
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 3>See your mouth is time to renegotiate and you have no negotiating power in this</v>

320
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:55.484
<v Speaker 3>negotiation.</v>

321
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 3>She kept threatening to take the kid away.</v>

322
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 3>That was her big thing.</v>

323
00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.241
<v Speaker 3>Take the kid away.</v>

324
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna move in with my parents,</v>

325
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 3>like all kinds of crazy shit,</v>

326
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:02.530
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

327
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

328
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 3>And just immediately,</v>

329
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

330
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 3>he went from being like the happiest guy.</v>

331
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:07.251
<v Speaker 3>I'm sighing.</v>

332
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 3>She's perfect.</v>

333
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 3>We get along so well.</v>

334
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a baby together.</v>

335
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be amazing too.</v>

336
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Dude.</v>

337
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>

338
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.111
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

339
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Like he was just constantly stressed down.</v>

340
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 3>His eyes were darting around the room and yeah.</v>

341
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

342
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like the old days when you had to stay married,</v>

343
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.883
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

344
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.551
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

345
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 3>that was our parents' generation.</v>

346
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 3>They stayed married.</v>

347
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 3>They hated each other.</v>

348
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying specifically,</v>

349
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:31.371
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean,</v>

350
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 3>like that divorce,</v>

351
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't do it.</v>

352
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 3>They just stayed married.</v>

353
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 3>They would like,</v>

354
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.681
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

355
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 3>we've been married for 50 years.</v>

356
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Don't particularly like each other,</v>

357
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.151
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

358
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

359
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 3>we gotta stay married because we made a vow,</v>

360
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.130
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

361
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

362
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

363
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.861
<v Speaker 3>that's how it was.</v>

364
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 3>It was a generational pressure.</v>

365
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>And now they say the opposite is true.</v>

366
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Like you have one bad day.</v>

367
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

368
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:52.934
<v Speaker 3>It's enough of this shit.</v>

369
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

370
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a religious thing too,</v>

371
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

372
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

373
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people don't want to get like Catholics especially did not want to</v>

374
00:08:59.371 --> 00:08:59.881
<v Speaker 2>get divorced.</v>

375
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:00.650
<v Speaker 2>That was a big thing.</v>

376
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

377
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

378
00:09:01.211 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 2>It was like the like an unforgivable sin.</v>

379
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 2>When I was young that was a big deal,</v>

382
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

383
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Someone talk about but getting divorced,</v>

384
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was a little kid,</v>

385
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of it was like they would start bringing up the church about the</v>

386
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:15.290
<v Speaker 2>church doesn't want you to getting divorced.</v>

387
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 2>You know in the eyes of the Lord you're married,</v>

388
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you should work this out and you don't,</v>

389
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem is who you are when you meet.</v>

390
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Say If you meet your 25 you know you fall in love,</v>

391
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.800
<v Speaker 2>you get married and you're 30 who you are at 30 is not who you are at 40 you</v>

392
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

393
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you are a different fucking human being but you have a much better chance then.</v>

394
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Then really young,</v>

395
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 2>like I have a niece,</v>

396
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:42.441
<v Speaker 2>she's 26 and she's engaged and I'm still waiting to see how this plays out</v>

397
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.050
<v Speaker 2>because he's 23 and I'm just like too young like you know it because just think</v>

398
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:54.501
<v Speaker 2>who you are at 23 to who you are at 30 completely different totally though.</v>

399
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's like if you grow up together,</v>

400
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

401
00:09:59.461 --> 00:09:59.761
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

402
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:00.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you go through those bumps together but it's too easy to be like a whole</v>

404
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 2>different person.</v>

405
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I moved out here,</v>

406
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>when I came to La I,</v>

407
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I worked uh,</v>

408
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 2>an aircraft so I went to aviation high school in New York.</v>

409
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Lockheed aircraft discovered this high school that trains airplane mechanics.</v>

410
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>So they literally hired hundreds of us like move to La,</v>

411
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:21.444
<v Speaker 2>you got a job.</v>

412
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I knew more guys 18 and 19 who married their girlfriend cause they didn't want</v>

413
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 2>to like they will leave at home,</v>

414
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

415
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm starting life,</v>

416
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get married.</v>

417
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.851
<v Speaker 2>Consequently,</v>

418
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I knew more guys who were divorced at 21</v>

419
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine my girlfriend in high school,</v>

420
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 2>my my eight when I was 18,</v>

421
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I would have definitely married her really 100%.</v>

422
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 2>How long you think it would last a week?</v>

423
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 2>A couple of months at the most sheet.</v>

424
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 2>She was a very nice girl,</v>

425
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:52.344
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

426
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>she moved across town,</v>

427
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

428
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.081
<v Speaker 2>not across town.</v>

429
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.741
<v Speaker 2>Across the state,</v>

430
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>like an hour and a half away and just,</v>

431
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I was so sad.</v>

432
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.523
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it.</v>

433
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 2>God Damn saw the way over there.</v>

434
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 2>If she wanted to get married and we would be together,</v>

435
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.013
<v Speaker 2>I would have done it.</v>

436
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 2>I will say without exaggeration,</v>

437
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.510
<v Speaker 2>without exaggeration of a hundred guys I knew married before they were 20.</v>

438
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I only know two.</v>

439
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.124
<v Speaker 2>Still buried.</v>

440
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I only know 200 guys got married.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you out of jail for a Dui back then?</v>

472
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.291
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

473
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>That was early eighties.</v>

474
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Probably about four or 500 bucks.</v>

475
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't,</v>

476
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.971
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>

477
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:01.181
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

478
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Back then it wasn't yet the big crime.</v>

479
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 3>It is now like back in around,</v>

480
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.881
<v Speaker 3>this is 80,</v>

481
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:07.391
<v Speaker 3>81,</v>

482
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 3>82 getting a DUI was like a really bad ticket,</v>

483
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.221
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't,</v>

484
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:12.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

485
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 3>you went to jail for one night,</v>

486
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't like it is now where you,</v>

487
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

488
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 3>now it's,</v>

489
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.280
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

490
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 3>it was a matter of fact,</v>

491
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I taught comedy traffic school and what the late nineties,</v>

492
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.750
<v Speaker 3>and they said a Dui then costs you 10,000 bucks by the time you paid for the</v>

493
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 3>fine and drunk driving school and a lawyer and all of that,</v>

494
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be a lot more than that now.</v>

495
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 3>It's probably 10 to 15 pedals,</v>

496
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:37.920
<v Speaker 3>a big crime now crime.</v>

497
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 3>When I was in high school,</v>

498
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 3>a kid I went to school with,</v>

499
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.453
<v Speaker 3>Nice Kid,</v>

500
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

501
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 3>gotten a drunk driving accident,</v>

502
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:45.724
<v Speaker 3>killed his friend.</v>

503
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Never forget that.</v>

504
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

505
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the worst part.</v>

506
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.081
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

507
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 3>if you have that because you gotta live with that.</v>

508
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

509
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.731
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

510
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 3>And I can't imagine it's bad enough if you have an accident,</v>

511
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 3>but if you're drunk and you have an accident or you kill your friend in the car</v>

512
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 3>or some shit like that,</v>

513
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.380
<v Speaker 3>having to live with that,</v>

514
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:06.214
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be the worst.</v>

515
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

516
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:07.294
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

517
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're any older than 17 or 18 at the time.</v>

518
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just learning how to drive really.</v>

519
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:13.841
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

520
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:14.674
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

521
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I heard about it,</v>

522
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 3>heard the whole story and I knew that he had tried to commit suicide in the</v>

523
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:20.411
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>

524
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 3>He tried to jump out the window.</v>

525
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 3>The cops told him they came up to him while he's in the hospital bed and said,</v>

526
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

527
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 3>you're a murderer now.</v>

528
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.121
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

529
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

530
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:28.901
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

531
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 3>your friend's dead.</v>

532
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 3>You're a murderer now.</v>

533
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

534
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:31.751
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

535
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:32.584
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

536
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:32.921
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

537
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 3>And he just freaked out and he just ran towards the window and they grabbed him</v>

538
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 3>and I was walking down the street in my neighborhood and,</v>

539
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:41.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

540
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.340
<v Speaker 3>he was walking towards me and I saw him and he saw me and we looked at each</v>

541
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 3>other and I said,</v>

542

543
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:47.891

00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:48.724

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget the sadness.</v>

548
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 3>The sadness was oozing out of his body.</v>

549
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.081
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

550
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:57.170
<v Speaker 3>They had this bastard,</v>

551
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.640
<v Speaker 3>they had this commercial and it was like the last text of people who died</v>

552

<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that one?</v>

554
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.191
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

555
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:07.024
<v Speaker 3>but there was a guy,</v>

556
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.763

00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Hilton's publicist drove off the fucking mountain in Malibu.</v>

562
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.010
<v Speaker 3>You know that that was a crazy winding roads and he was a,</v>

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 2>you don't think when you're driving and you're drunk,</v>

588
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:02.954
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

589
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 2>you don't think it's going to happen to you.</v>

590
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

591
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the real [inaudible].</v>

592
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Everyone thinks it's,</v>

593
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>everyone thinks that someone else I can drive.</v>

594
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

595
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:10.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

596
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 2>that's what alcohol does to you though.</v>

597
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol has you convinced that everything's going to be fine.</v>

598
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:14.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 2>You hold all of your perceptions off so you think it.</v>

600
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

601
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>

602
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Which is like the exact opposite of pot.</v>

603
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.071
<v Speaker 2>When you smoke pot,</v>

604
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:22.281
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

605
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking drive,</v>

606
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:23.980
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

607
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.240
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I can drive like drive.</v>

608
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 2>When you're high,</v>

609
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 2>everything works like you can hit the brakes.</v>

610
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 2>You can make turns,</v>

611
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 2>but you're convinced that there's no fucking way you're going to be able to make</v>

612
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:34.274
<v Speaker 2>this exit.</v>

613
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.570
<v Speaker 2>The exit's over there.</v>

614
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I got to get over there.</v>

615
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:37.334
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

616
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the first times I ever drove when I was high.</v>

617
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't believe I was driving.</v>

618
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:41.661
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

619
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 2>this is so bad.</v>

620
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.574
<v Speaker 2>This is so bad.</v>

621
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

622
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I was going 55 miles an hour,</v>

623
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 2>staying in the lane was very aware of everything.</v>

624
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:49.431
<v Speaker 2>Looking left,</v>

625
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:49.941
<v Speaker 2>looking right,</v>

626
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 2>looking in the rear view mirror.</v>

627
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 2>But if I was drunk I'd been like,</v>

628
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.030
<v Speaker 2>I got this guy wouldn't,</v>

629
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 2>when I used to get loaded,</v>

630
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I could drive high.</v>

631
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I never liked to be a drunk cause I always felt out of control.</v>

632
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

633
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:03.000
<v Speaker 2>just let,</v>

634
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 2>not like crazy out of control but sloppy out of control.</v>

635
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 2>He wants terrible drug.</v>

636
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

637
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.420
<v Speaker 2>So especially the next morning when you wake up sober in jail or you realize</v>

638
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:17.804

<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Crip,</v>

720
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going back looking for the guy and the cop swooped on the street and</v>

721
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>they come in from both sides with cars,</v>

722
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.530

725
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>It hits the gutter above the window and lands in my lap.</v>

726
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.793
<v Speaker 2>When the cop,</v>

727
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I had a rock my lap,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know how you think a cut like a rock.</v>

730
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 2>If your windows open a rock,</v>

731
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 2>you can just flick it like a bugger.</v>

732
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>

733
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 2>He tried to throw it out the side window passenger.</v>

734
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

735
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

736
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Drivers bounced off.</v>

737
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Literally hit that gutter or you know that little rail above the window and</v>

738
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:41.971
<v Speaker 2>bounced right.</v>

739
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Landed right in my lap to daddy's shit.</v>

740
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Luck man.</v>

741
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Great lucky.</v>

742
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Great luck in the long run.</v>

743
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 2>But in the moment,</v>

744
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 2>not good.</v>

745
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.663
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

746
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 2>So Dan was the moment you decided to quit when I,</v>

747
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:54.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

748
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 2>that night in jail.</v>

749
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:59.520
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those things where like it's one of those moments where you</v>

750
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 2>realize I'm not supposed to be here.</v>

751
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.031
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

752
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

753
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 2>like with everything that had transpired in my life,</v>

754
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:08.180
<v Speaker 2>like I was still in aerospace then,</v>

755
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.023
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

756
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 2>licensed airplane mechanic,</v>

757
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:11.790
<v Speaker 2>good job,</v>

758
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.001
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

759
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:12.121
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

760
00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

761
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.230
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

762
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.940
<v Speaker 2>It just hit me in that moment.</v>

763
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not how it's supposed to end because I knew guys who had gone down</v>

764
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 2>that road,</v>

765
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

766
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I knew guys who were doing time and shit like that.</v>

767
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

768
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.540
<v Speaker 2>and for a lot of guys,</v>

769
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 2>jail is just part of life.</v>

770
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.871
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

771
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I go away for a couple of years,</v>

772
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:30.211
<v Speaker 2>come back,</v>

773
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not that guy.</v>

774
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.101
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

775
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't want to,</v>

776
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to become that guy.</v>

777
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:40.551
<v Speaker 2>I had no aspiration when I was a kid that one of the neighbors' sons,</v>

778
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.690
<v Speaker 2>he was in Attica,</v>

779
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and I will never forget this.</v>

780
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 2>We were going somewhere upstate New York and we went to visit him.</v>

781
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.650
<v Speaker 2>And when you go in and that gate closest behind you,</v>

782
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:55.320
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know if you've ever been in a maximum security prison,</v>

783
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 2>but when that gate,</v>

784
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.113
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

785
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 2>toluene never forgot that sound for the rest of my was like,</v>

786
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck no.</v>

787
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 2>They say whatever I do,</v>

788
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 2>this ain't where I'm going to end up.</v>

789
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Where did he go to Attica for a robbery.</v>

790
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.493
<v Speaker 2>Armed robbery.</v>

791
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

792
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 2>He was in the armed robbery.</v>

793
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.491
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

794
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:14.700
<v Speaker 2>he was a habitual criminal.</v>

795
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 2>He'd spent the rest of his life.</v>

796
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 2>He was never out of jail for more than a year.</v>

797
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Because once you get in that system,</v>

798
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 2>then you're always getting picked up for something.</v>

799
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

800
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>and the people that you know and the people that you surround yourself with,</v>

801
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.230
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a pattern that you're constantly around.</v>

802
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.700
<v Speaker 2>People that are doing things like that.</v>

803
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 2>It becomes normal.</v>

804
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.110
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

805
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

806
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:34.981
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

807
00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 2>It becomes normal.</v>

808
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.270
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

809
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 2>and once it becomes normal,</v>

810
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:38.001
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

811
00:20:38.001 --> 00:20:39.090
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to crack.</v>

812
00:20:39.091 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 2>So how old were you when you first tried crack?</v>

813
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

814
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

815
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of tough to crack 22,</v>

816
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe 23,</v>

817
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

818
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 2>And what was the scenario?</v>

819
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

820
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.900
<v Speaker 2>well actually the first time I tried,</v>

821
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.181
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

822
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:56.014
<v Speaker 2>It started out,</v>

823
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:56.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

824
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 2>like just party and as a kid smoking weed,</v>

825
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

826
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.740
<v Speaker 2>drink a beer,</v>

827
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.151
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

828
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and then get into a little cocaine</v>

829
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:06.783
<v Speaker 2>here and there,</v>

830
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

832
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.003
<v Speaker 2>snorting it.</v>

833
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I had a friend and this had to be [inaudible] 84,</v>

834
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe 83,</v>

835
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

836
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.400
<v Speaker 2>when people were still just starting to get into freebase and,</v>

837
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 2>and crack and stuff like that.</v>

838
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>And he hit it and he gave me the pipe and I hit it and I was like,</v>

839
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

840
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

841
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.431
<v Speaker 2>it scared me.</v>

842
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:27.731
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

843
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:28.564
<v Speaker 2>this is too good.</v>

844
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.291
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

845
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:29.561
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

846
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:30.394
<v Speaker 2>you better.</v>

847
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 2>You better get off this shit.</v>

848
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 2>This is gonna like you're gonna lose everything.</v>

849
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

850
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause the high was so good,</v>

851
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.361
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

852
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 2>And what does it feel like?</v>

853
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Describe it?</v>

854
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.873
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

855
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a rush.</v>

856
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.360
<v Speaker 2>It's an overpowering rush of energy and I don't,</v>

857
00:21:49.821 --> 00:21:50.381
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

858
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 2>like a lightning bolt hitting you with no pain but,</v>

859
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:54.574
<v Speaker 2>but just like,</v>

860
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 2>like you're,</v>

861
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.081
<v Speaker 2>you're buzzing.</v>

862
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Like your whole body is just,</v>

863
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess cocaine works on whatever the,</v>

865
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:01.804
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

866
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.070
<v Speaker 2>the receptors of good feelings and your,</v>

867
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it's called me scientifically,</v>

868
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:07.361
<v Speaker 2>it's dopamine,</v>

869
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 2>but they're also like nerve during nerve endings that make you feel good and</v>

870
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 2>cocaine works on these and,</v>

871
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 2>and crack is such,</v>

872
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.880
<v Speaker 2>such an intense hit.</v>

873
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like doing it all at once and as opposed to when you're snorting it,</v>

874
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 2>you're getting high a little here a little bit.</v>

875
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Now it's concentrated and it's a,</v>

876
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a rush but it,</v>

877
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's beyond anything else.</v>

878
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:30.730
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

879
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.800
<v Speaker 2>it is instantly addicting.</v>

880
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.140
<v Speaker 2>It is because it's a rush that you've never felt before any or whatnot.</v>

881
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I've never shot up so I can't compare it to shooting drugs.</v>

882
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.260
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

883
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I had never felt anything like that and it literally scared me.</v>

884
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And then like a year and a half later is when I got into doing it myself,</v>

885
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:51.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 2>with some other guys.</v>

887
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 2>And it was like me and this other guy,</v>

888
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 2>we kind of said we're going to watch each other.</v>

889
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.181
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

890
00:22:58.181 --> 00:22:59.014
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

891
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 2>like he'll tell me when to stop or I'll tell him when the state,</v>

892
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:06.940
<v Speaker 2>and it actually worked for as long as we were both in the same room,</v>

893
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

894
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 2>But then so you decided to be like sitters for each other?</v>

895
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:10.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:10.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

897
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 2>With cause you knew because you,</v>

898
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.660
<v Speaker 2>cause we'd seen people,</v>

899
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 2>we've seen people get sprung and lose everything.</v>

900
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 2>The first guy who,</v>

901
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 2>who turned me on to it,</v>

902
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I watched him lose,</v>

903
00:23:20.741 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>he had this incredibly beautiful girlfriend.</v>

904
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>She dumped him.</v>

905
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Then he lost his card and he lost his apartment.</v>

906
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Like it literally crack.</v>

907
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:29.051
<v Speaker 2>We'll take,</v>

908
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

909
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

910
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor's jokes like that shit is true to pipe would tell you that ain't</v>

911
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:35.480
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

912
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.313
<v Speaker 2>You and me,</v>

913
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.480
<v Speaker 2>it's you and me.</v>

914
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:37.961
<v Speaker 2>You Ain't,</v>

915
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:39.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't need this bitch.</v>

916
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't need that fucking car.</v>

917
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.441
<v Speaker 2>You don't need,</v>

918
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:41.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:42.001
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

920
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I sold a crack car,</v>

921
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I sold a car I had for five bucks,</v>

922
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:46.540
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

924
00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>to smoke that up.</v>

925
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 2>How often were you smoking at the end?</v>

926
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

927
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I was daily.</v>

928
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 2>As much as often as I could get the money daily.</v>

929
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

930
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.171
<v Speaker 2>As,</v>

931
00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 2>as often as I could get.</v>

932
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I still had a job almost to the end,</v>

933
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.851
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

934
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 2>And I got laid off from my job,</v>

935
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 2>so when I got my paycheck,</v>

936
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.000
<v Speaker 2>that's when it would start and it,</v>

937
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 2>and it was always the same bullshit.</v>

938
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

939
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.321
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

940
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm only going to do like one eight ball.</v>

941
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

942
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.323
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

943
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 2>it's been 150 bucks that's going to be it,</v>

944
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.751
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

945
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 2>So you get that and then you smoke that up,</v>

946
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:17.061
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

947
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:17.331
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

948
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm on gone 20 more like I'm only gonna do 20 more.</v>

949
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm only gonna do 20 more.</v>

950
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:21.710
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

951
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.200
<v Speaker 2>you do that and then next thing you know,</v>

952
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:24.561
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

953
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the next day and it's all gone and the money's gone.</v>

954
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

955
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>

956
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.141
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

957
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a criminal.</v>

958
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't come from that.</v>

959
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 2>That's where my head was.</v>

960
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

961
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>my next stop was,</v>

962
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.321
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

963
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.380
<v Speaker 2>how do I steal something or rip somebody off or whatever.</v>

964
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

965
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:44.893
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

966
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:45.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

967
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's totally,</v>

968
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

969
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:46.851
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

970
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>but the bad thing is once you get to that point,</v>

971
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting high anymore because your brain's so fried that the drug's</v>

972
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.181
<v Speaker 2>not working,</v>

973
00:24:56.181 --> 00:24:57.060
<v Speaker 2>like whatever the,</v>

974
00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.860
<v Speaker 2>the nerves and need the brain cells and stuff are fried.</v>

975
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 2>So you're smoking it,</v>

976
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 2>but you're not getting that,</v>

977
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 2>that rush anymore.</v>

978
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:05.691
<v Speaker 2>You're chasing it,</v>

979
00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you want it,</v>

980
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but you can't find it.</v>

981
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 2>So the initial rush that you get,</v>

982
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 2>the first time you do it,</v>

983
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>it's just overwhelming.</v>

984
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 2>And then everything else has to diminish his more and more never,</v>

985
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

986
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:15.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

987
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 2>like shot a song.</v>

988
00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's never as good as the first time that,</v>

989
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

990
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.960
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

991
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.710
<v Speaker 2>and that's the whole thing with drug addiction.</v>

992
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.970
<v Speaker 2>With any drug.</v>

993
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so good that first time that you're chasing it and you can't get that feel.</v>

994
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

995
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the difference between addicts and regular people.</v>

996
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Like regular people.</v>

997
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Like you get high and you're like,</v>

998
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

999
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:36.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1000
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1001
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm a high,</v>

1002
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1003
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm in jail.</v>

1004
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a good time,</v>

1005
00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:40.641
<v Speaker 2>but it said that,</v>

1006
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:41.180
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1007
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.750
<v Speaker 2>but when you're an addict it's like you want that ultimate feeling that you got</v>

1008
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 2>that one time and you will,</v>

1009
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 2>you'll sacrifice everything to get it.</v>

1010
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never fucked with coke.</v>

1012
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1013
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that feeling is it coke in general is an up drug.</v>

1014
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.610
<v Speaker 2>It ups your energy and a heightened sense of awareness.</v>

1015
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 2>That's why like you get coke,</v>

1016
00:26:03.381 --> 00:26:04.041
<v Speaker 2>paranoia.</v>

1017
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I had coke bugs one time cook bugs,</v>

1018
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:06.961
<v Speaker 2>coke,</v>

1019
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:07.794
<v Speaker 2>the crawling on you.</v>

1020
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 2>It feels like something's crawling in your skin and you're scratching.</v>

1021
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.940
<v Speaker 2>But people have cut themselves open.</v>

1022
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1023
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.111
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1024
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Could but,</v>

1025
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>but I'll never forget that.</v>

1026
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 2>That was the weirdest thing cause it literally felt like there were bugs</v>

1027
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:22.910
<v Speaker 2>crawling out of my skin and I'm just like,</v>

1028
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

1029
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:23.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1030
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.613
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1031
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 2>but it does that like,</v>

1032
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 2>cause it affects your nervous system.</v>

1033
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 2>And this is the extreme.</v>

1034
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:29.834
<v Speaker 2>This is beat.</v>

1035
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the,</v>

1036
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1037
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 2>snort coke would a chick in the bathroom of a club.</v>

1038
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1039
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:37.670
<v Speaker 2>that this is beyond that.</v>

1040
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1041
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 2>this is beyond the fun part.</v>

1042
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Did the snorting grab you as much as the smoking or was smoking it?</v>

1043
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>We're really good.</v>

1044
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.470
<v Speaker 2>A snorting was,</v>

1045
00:26:45.471 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 2>the snorting was good,</v>

1046
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 2>but snorting is also hard on you.</v>

1047
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Like your nose gets fucked up.</v>

1048
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:50.851
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1049
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:51.061
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1050
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:56.061
<v Speaker 2>in the 80s there were a lot of deviated septums and there were a lot of plastic</v>

1051
00:26:56.341 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 2>surgeons putting noses back together in the 80s.</v>

1052
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 2>But what eats through your nose?</v>

1053
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:00.891
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

1054
00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:01.900
<v Speaker 2>It literally each three.</v>

1055
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 2>If that was true,</v>

1056
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:03.751
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1057
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 2>that's center membrane goes away and you know,</v>

1058
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 2>it just becomes one big nostril and probably better for cardio.</v>

1059
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 2>What day you go,</v>

1061
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.031
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1062
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I used to work out,</v>

1063
00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:13.021
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1064
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I used to get coked up and work out at a 24 hour gym.</v>

1065
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.943
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1066
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.940
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't in shape,</v>

1067
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:20.270
<v Speaker 2>my heart would have exploded with somebody.</v>

1068
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Shit I used to do.</v>

1069
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 2>But you do it for the rush cause you're coked up and then you start lifting and</v>

1070
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:25.891
<v Speaker 2>you know how it is.</v>

1071
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 2>You get that pump and now you're like that and you just feel like you can</v>

1072
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 2>fucking explode,</v>

1073
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:31.951
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1074
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:32.101
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1075
00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:32.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1076
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1077
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure my heart was doing 150 beats a minute late.</v>

1078
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 2>You were coked up lifting weights.</v>

1079
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1080
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1081
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.140
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1082
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.830
<v Speaker 2>and that was one of the reasons I think that I was able to hide it because I</v>

1083
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:46.810
<v Speaker 2>didn't look like a crackhead cause I didn't lose weight cause I,</v>

1084
00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1085
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I got coked up and worked out.</v>

1086
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.483
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1087
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I ate when I wasn't on it.</v>

1088
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat when I was on it,</v>

1089
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 2>but I ate when I wasn't on it.</v>

1090
00:27:57.511 --> 00:27:57.991
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1091
00:27:57.991 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1092
00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>you were doing it every day?</v>

1093
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.011
<v Speaker 2>But well,</v>

1096
00:28:01.011 --> 00:28:01.844
<v Speaker 2>every day is,</v>

1097
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 2>as long as I had the money,</v>

1098
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the money would run out.</v>

1099
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 2>So if I got paid Thursday,</v>

1100
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 2>every day lasted til Saturday,</v>

1101
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe Sunday.</v>

1102
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And then you just get a little chip here in that little piece,</v>

1103
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 2>but nothing to keep your high all day.</v>

1104
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:14.560
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I,</v>

1105
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

1106
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot to hide it.</v>

1107
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:17.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1108
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I led this dual life.</v>

1109
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I worked during the day and I was the airplane mechanic and then when I got</v>

1110
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:23.071
<v Speaker 2>off work,</v>

1111
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I just lock myself up in my apartment coke.</v>

1112
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.410
<v Speaker 2>I lived like that for</v>

1113
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 2>my life was fully like that for a little over a year.</v>

1114
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:35.761
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1115
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:36.930
<v Speaker 2>but the worst part,</v>

1116
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the last two years was when it,</v>

1117
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.833
<v Speaker 2>when it was bad,</v>

1118
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.363
<v Speaker 2>it was bad.</v>

1119
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So you went crazy for a year or you just dude,</v>

1120
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 2>what you drink and just try to calm your heart to know you drink because first</v>

1121
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:49.351
<v Speaker 2>of all you,</v>

1122
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:50.820
<v Speaker 2>your torch was um,</v>

1123
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.210
<v Speaker 2>a little cotton ball dipped into one 51 rum.</v>

1124
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1125
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Speaker 2>so you had one 51 there.</v>

1126
00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:01.140
<v Speaker 2>So you would drink that cause you have it and you drink torch.</v>

1127
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.290
<v Speaker 2>And then other words like you didn't,</v>

1129
00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't cook crack with a lighter,</v>

1130
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1131
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I hate giving crack lessons.</v>

1132
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Please do on the podcast.</v>

1133
00:29:07.681 --> 00:29:08.650
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1134
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't hope you don't hold the lighter.</v>

1135
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.101
<v Speaker 2>You need a torch.</v>

1136
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>You needed like a hotter flame.</v>

1137
00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So you would take,</v>

1138
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to remember</v>

1139
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 2>how we did it.</v>

1140
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1141
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember what you dipped into the rum and it's great that I don't</v>

1142
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:22.591
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>

1143
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Cause I remember the screen.</v>

1144
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Was this a chore boy,</v>

1145
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 2>which was like a steel wool but no soap in it.</v>

1146
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what you used as a screen in the pipe.</v>

1147
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.783
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

1148
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I forget how I did the torch,</v>

1149
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:35.071
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1150
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:40.071
<v Speaker 2>the torch you would dip it into one 51 rum and light that because that was a</v>

1151
00:29:40.621 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 2>hotter than using a lighter.</v>

1152
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1153
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:44.543
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1154
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1155
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 2>they came out with those,</v>

1156
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 2>they came out with a torch lighters later.</v>

1157
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 2>But like you knew certain crackhead things and you would like when you were at a</v>

1158
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 2>crackhead liquor store,</v>

1159
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.411
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1160
00:29:55.411 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1161
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 2>you could tell by stuff they sold.</v>

1162
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Like they would just have shore boy scrub brushes and they would have like one</v>

1163
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 2>51 rum,</v>

1164
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 2>but like in,</v>

1165
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 2>in half pints,</v>

1166
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 2>know who's buying a half pint out at one 51 you know what I mean?</v>

1168
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:10.174
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1169
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.830
<v Speaker 2>you get bic lighters,</v>

1170
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 2>you get that pack of five cause you'd go through lighters all the time.</v>

1171
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 2>So you just,</v>

1172
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1173
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>

1174
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

1175
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.081
<v Speaker 2>That was the life.</v>

1176
00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 2>But it was the,</v>

1177
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 2>it was the initial rush man.</v>

1178
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 2>The rush was like,</v>

1179
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and once you hit it,</v>

1180
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 2>once you hit that,</v>

1181
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 2>then nothing else mattered.</v>

1182
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.681
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1183
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:30.041
<v Speaker 2>Like in,</v>

1184
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

1185
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 2>once you got that first hit,</v>

1186
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 2>then you didn't care about and that's,</v>

1187
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.320
<v Speaker 2>that's why you hear about those stories about people you know,</v>

1188
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 2>leaving the tragic stuff,</v>

1189
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 2>leaving their kid in the car while they are in the crack house or you know,</v>

1190
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:47.650
<v Speaker 2>the guy who never comes home or whatever because you are out of your,</v>

1191
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:48.110
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1192
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1193
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:49.531
<v Speaker 2>it took over.</v>

1194
00:30:49.531 --> 00:30:49.800
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

1195
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.800
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't very rarely did you come across a social crack user crack dominated</v>

1196
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.763
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1197
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1198
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1199
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 2>what you saw,</v>

1200
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 2>what you saw happened to Chris Rock and new Jack City.</v>

1201
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

1202
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.573
<v Speaker 2>That was real.</v>

1203
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it was done.</v>

1204
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 2>That's how it would take you over.</v>

1205
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that you kicked it just from one arrest.</v>

00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:04.360
<v Speaker 2>I just did it again.</v>

1253
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't show up for this.</v>

1254
00:32:06.221 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't show up for that.</v>

1255
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm missing work,</v>

1256
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.183
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1257
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:09.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1258
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 2>pay bills aren't paid.</v>

1259
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:11.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1260
00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:13.510
<v Speaker 2>I went through bankruptcy the whole bit.</v>

1261
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1262
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:16.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you're destroying your life.</v>

1264
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.260
<v Speaker 2>And so the arrest was just like the,</v>

1265
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1266
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 2>when it all came to a head,</v>

1267
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:23.651
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1268
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:28.651
<v Speaker 2>Cause it now I'm just in jail by myself sitting in Van Nuys jail with nothing</v>

1269
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:29.711
<v Speaker 2>but nothing.</v>

1270
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:31.890
<v Speaker 2>But my thoughts of this is how,</v>

1271
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.793
<v Speaker 2>this is what I did.</v>

1272
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:33.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:35.200
<v Speaker 2>They say that you need a rock bottom,</v>

1274
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:36.034
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1275
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's different for,</v>

1277
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it's different for everybody,</v>

1278
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 2>but you that bottom.</v>

1279
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing I remembered after that when I went to rehab was I never want</v>

1280
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 2>to feel like that again.</v>

1281
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:48.321
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1282
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:48.921
<v Speaker 2>like whatever,</v>

1283
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens in my life,</v>

1284
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to feel like that again.</v>

1285
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.793
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1286
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 2>So bad timing on the Rehab.</v>

1287
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a good rock bottom though to good rock bottom story too.</v>

1288
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a real rock bottom.</v>

1289
00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to rehab,</v>

1290
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 2>if I had walked out of the house on last comic,</v>

1291
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 2>standing into celebrity Rehab,</v>

1292
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 2>how fucking famous would I be now?</v>

1293
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

1294
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.671
<v Speaker 2>Pretty famous.</v>

1295
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1296
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.833
<v Speaker 2>I blew it.</v>

1297
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.340
<v Speaker 2>He timed it more timing.</v>

1298
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.820
<v Speaker 2>When did you start doing stand up?</v>

1299
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1300
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the funny thing.</v>

1301
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's literally one of those cases where the worst thing in your life leads</v>

1302
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 2>to the best thing in your life.</v>

1303
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So I go to Rehab.</v>

1304
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1305
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.190
<v Speaker 2>and when you're in re I was in outpatient,</v>

1306
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 2>so you're in these meetings and there's psychologists and whatever.</v>

1307
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:33.620
<v Speaker 2>And so it was,</v>

1308
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 2>this was in court appointed.</v>

1309
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 2>This was like your own decision?</v>

1310
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:36.681
<v Speaker 2>My thing.</v>

1311
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1312
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause I had gone when I had my job,</v>

1313
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I had tried rehab once and I didn't make it,</v>

1314
00:33:41.901 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't give a shit,</v>

1315
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 2>so I went back to the same place and they let me back in.</v>

1317
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.870
<v Speaker 2>So four hours a day you're doing the psychology thing and the meetings and</v>

1318
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.853
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>

1319
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And this woman came in and she,</v>

1320
00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.490
<v Speaker 2>she was from the people who are in recovery go to rehabs and they tell people</v>

1321
00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 2>like this is how it works,</v>

1322
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 2>this is what it's like,</v>

1323
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.613
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah.</v>

1324
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.000
<v Speaker 2>So she was hot as all I remember is she was hot as hell,</v>

1325
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:09.800
<v Speaker 2>and she was from New York.</v>

1327
00:34:09.801 --> 00:34:10.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1328
00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1329
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.990
<v Speaker 2>so after she talks,</v>

1330
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I make my move,</v>

1331
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:13.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1332
00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm sober like three fucking days.</v>

1333
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1334
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.363
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1335
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:17.481
<v Speaker 2>but she said,</v>

1336
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:17.841
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1337
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm married but there are a lot of women like me to go to a place called studio</v>

1338
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:24.980
<v Speaker 2>12 and studio 12 was a rehab for the crew.</v>

1339
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:27.050
<v Speaker 2>So the stars went to Betty Ford.</v>

1340
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 2>But the crew that the electricians,</v>

1341
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:31.190
<v Speaker 2>the lighting guys,</v>

1342
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 2>the makeup artists,</v>

1343
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:32.924
<v Speaker 2>the clothes,</v>

1344
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 2>they all went to this place called studio 12 and that's where she was from.</v>

1345
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.900
<v Speaker 2>So she took me over there and I met these guys and I started going to meetings</v>

1346
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 2>there and I got,</v>

1347
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 2>that's where I got sober.</v>

1348
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Those were the guys who helped me,</v>

1349
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.060
<v Speaker 2>who showed me,</v>

1350
00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 2>who I sponsored me with everything else.</v>

1351
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 2>But they were also,</v>

1352
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:52.890
<v Speaker 2>they were in the entertainment business and,</v>

1353
00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and I always had a sense of humor.</v>

1354
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I could make people laugh,</v>

1355
00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 2>but I had never thought about it.</v>

1356
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you're not like,</v>

1357
00:34:58.641 --> 00:34:58.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1358
00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in blue collar home and then you,</v>

1359
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:01.971
<v Speaker 2>you grow up,</v>

1360
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:02.541
<v Speaker 2>you go to school,</v>

1361
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:03.231
<v Speaker 2>you get a job,</v>

1362
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:04.700
<v Speaker 2>like entertainment show business,</v>

1363
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 2>nowhere on the radar.</v>

1364
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Speaker 2>That's something that other people do and you watch on TV.</v>

1365
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.420
<v Speaker 2>But now I know guys who were in it,</v>

1366
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I know people who are doing it.</v>

1367
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>And I was teaching aerospace and making people laugh and shit like that.</v>

1368
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:17.271
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1369
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a comic.</v>

1370
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And my AA sponsor was like,</v>

1371
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:20.601
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1372
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:21.171
<v Speaker 2>go for it,</v>

1373
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 2>try it.</v>

1374
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1375
00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:26.630
<v Speaker 2>and I literally did one of those writing classes and I did the five minute</v>

1376
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 2>graduation hooked and from then on that,</v>

1377
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 2>so that's how my comedy career started.</v>

1378
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.360
<v Speaker 2>So it was it a writing like a sandy shore type class and it was a,</v>

1379
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Len Ostvich,</v>

1380
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 2>he to write for rich Jenny.</v>

1381
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1382
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And he was um,</v>

1383
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 2>he was in somewhere in Santa Monica.</v>

1384
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:45.621
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

1385
00:35:45.621 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>they used to be a theater in Santa Monica where they used to do,</v>

1386
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1387
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.911
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was,</v>

1388
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 2>this comedy central half hour comedy thing,</v>

1389
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was called,</v>

1390
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.450
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1391
00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:56.011
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1392
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 2>he used to work there and that's where he did the class.</v>

1393
00:35:58.441 --> 00:35:59.310
<v Speaker 2>So I did the,</v>

1394
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I did his six week writing class and a five minute graduation show.</v>

1395
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.411
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1396
00:36:05.411 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 2>and just absolutely knew it.</v>

1397
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:08.311
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>

1398
00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm going to do.</v>

1399
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm never going to fix an airplane again.</v>

1400
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.203
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this.</v>

1401
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.691
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1402
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:13.524
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1403
00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:14.041
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1404
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1405
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 2>that's how it started.</v>

1406
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Then it was just open mikes and grinding and everything else.</v>

1407
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1408
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of dudes who got into it because they would go to Aa and then</v>

1409
00:36:23.121 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 2>they'd have those meetings and they go up in the meetings and they would tell</v>

1410
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 2>funny stories about shit they did when they were fucked up.</v>

1411
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:29.791
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1413
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I got laughs in meetings,</v>

1414
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

1415
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.330
<v Speaker 2>it was almost unintentional.</v>

1416
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:34.051
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

1417
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling a story,</v>

1418
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's coming out funny.</v>

1419
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not trying to be funny.</v>

1420
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1421
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.090
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1422
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It just comes out that because you know how it is,</v>

1423
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:43.410
<v Speaker 2>if you have a sense of humor when you tell a story,</v>

1424
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be funny,</v>

1425
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know what I was doing,</v>

1426
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1427
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

1428
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I had this sense of humor and what recovery did,</v>

1429
00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 2>it changed my sense of humor from like this,</v>

1430
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 2>this anger,</v>

1431
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 2>belittling,</v>

1432
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.670
<v Speaker 2>ripping on people thing to jokes.</v>

1433
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm in on the joke,</v>

1434
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:01.800
<v Speaker 2>like now it's just funny,</v>

1435
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 2>like instead of being an attack,</v>

1436
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:05.101
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1437
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 2>so before when you were doing coke,</v>

1438
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.940
<v Speaker 2>it was like aggressive,</v>

1439
00:37:08.941 --> 00:37:10.340
<v Speaker 2>like angry at everybody.</v>

1440
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.423
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

1441
00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 2>because you're paranoid and you're fucked up and,</v>

1442
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 2>and when you do talk to people or whatever,</v>

1443
00:37:16.831 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 2>you're just kind of separate from him,</v>

1444
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1445
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1446
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:20.843
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1447
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1448
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:21.781
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1449
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 2>that literally it had I not gotten sober,</v>

1450
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have become a comic.</v>

1451
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1452
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.721
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1453
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:28.590
<v Speaker 2>can you throw some tea on?</v>

1454
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck is going on in my throat,</v>

1455
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.150
<v Speaker 2>but I know that people listening to this probably like,</v>

1456
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 2>we stopped fucking clear on your throat.</v>

1457
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.751
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1458
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't help her folks.</v>

1459
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1460
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it might,</v>

1461
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 2>you might have gone a little heavy with the grass fed butter and today's coffee.</v>

1462
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1463
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.063
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's it,</v>

1464
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 2>but I'm never tried to butter in coffee.</v>

1465
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:47.664
<v Speaker 2>I heard it's better.</v>

1466
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>It's better than sugar.</v>

1467
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:49.481
<v Speaker 2>Try some,</v>

1468
00:37:49.481 --> 00:37:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you might start Fleming up to maybe some of my age.</v>

1469
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1470
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.203
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1471
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1472
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1473
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.190
<v Speaker 2>when I was starting out,</v>

1474
00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:58.320
<v Speaker 2>when I was an open mic or if there was a lot of guys,</v>

1475
00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy named Dave Fitzgerald who was a really funny guy.</v>

1476
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1477
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1478
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.211
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

1479
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:08.211
<v Speaker 2>his whole life he was just doing blow and partying and drinking and fucking up.</v>

1480
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.190
<v Speaker 2>And then he finally got himself cleaned up,</v>

1481
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1482
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:12.991
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>

1483
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:13.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1484
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1485
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.070
<v Speaker 2>going to meetings and then started making people laugh at these meetings.</v>

1486
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.031
<v Speaker 2>And he was a,</v>

1487
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:18.811
<v Speaker 2>he was a good writer,</v>

1488
00:38:18.811 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1489
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 2>a funny comic.</v>

1490
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.020
<v Speaker 2>And then he got sick.</v>

1491
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.161
<v Speaker 2>He got sick one.</v>

1492
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:23.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying of cancer.</v>

1493
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 2>He would've been,</v>

1494
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 2>he would've been a big comic.</v>

1495
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.843
<v Speaker 2>He would have made it.</v>

1496
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 2>He had a real good sense of humor.</v>

1497
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:29.400
<v Speaker 2>He's a funny dude,</v>

1498
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.511
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1528
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:20.380

<v Speaker 2>The gloves they did.</v>

1535
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.680
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1536
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.051
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1537
00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1538
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.150
<v Speaker 2>this is a real procedure.</v>

1539
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:28.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1540
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 2>it's funny that you said that you,</v>

1541
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.270
<v Speaker 2>you grew up in a blue collar house and that you didn't know like entertainment</v>

1542
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 2>was never on the radar because I think that's the case for a lot of people that</v>

1543
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 2>once you're around someone,</v>

1544
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 2>like when you're around those people that were working in show business,</v>

1545
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1546
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.380
<v Speaker 2>oh these are just regular people.</v>

1547
00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a job.</v>

1548
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:45.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1549
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:46.380
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

1550
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1551
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.733
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

1552
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 2>That's the case with a lot of things,</v>

1553
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:50.261
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1554
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It's all absolutely.</v>

1555
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:51.851
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1556
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:53.440
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this the other day,</v>

1557
00:39:53.441 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about race car drivers,</v>

1558
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1559
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Cause a lot of drivers,</v>

1560
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 2>their kids,</v>

1561
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:00.940
<v Speaker 2>their father was a race car driver.</v>

1562
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So to them that's normal.</v>

1563
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.471
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1564
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:05.711
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1565
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:05.951
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1566
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:07.450
<v Speaker 2>but to most people,</v>

1567
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 2>the idea of driving a car to 150,</v>

1568
00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 2>200 miles an hour,</v>

1569
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 2>they out Yada your mind.</v>

1570
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.200
<v Speaker 2>But like if you grow,</v>

1571
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.520
<v Speaker 2>but if your dad did it,</v>

1572
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 2>then you start driving go karts when you're like three years old.</v>

1573
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:19.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1574
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:20.201
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1575
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:22.120
<v Speaker 2>And then you grow up and you do it and it's,</v>

1576
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:24.670
<v Speaker 2>you never think about like,</v>

1577
00:40:24.671 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 2>this is unusual.</v>

1578
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that movie?</v>

1579
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.820

1643
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 3>The knock on Danica Patrick.</v>

1644
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And it is true.</v>

1645
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like she ain't gonna win and she has an attitude about it.</v>

1646
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like she did all the go daddy,</v>

1647
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1648
00:42:10.711 --> 00:42:12.650
<v Speaker 3>to bikini stuff and this and that.</v>

1649
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.731
<v Speaker 3>And then she's like,</v>

1650
00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:13.851
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1651
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 3>why do you treat me like a girl selling bikini pictures like you?</v>

1652
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1653
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything,</v>

1654
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1655
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.140
<v Speaker 3>people will say there's something that the,</v>

1656
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 3>there's like it lessens a girl to sell herself in bikinis or something like</v>

1657
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1658
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that is total bullshit.</v>

1659
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I know my take on it a girl's body,</v>

1660
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:39.070
<v Speaker 3>like when a girl has a hot body like keys for a guy that is the most desirable</v>

1661
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 3>thing to look at on the planet.</v>

1662
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 3>When you see a girl like,</v>

1663
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 3>like it has like Jennifer Lopez,</v>

1664
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:45.314
<v Speaker 3>his ass,</v>

1665
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.660
<v Speaker 3>you know that little thin waist and big ass and like good luck.</v>

1666
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a girl in line to take pictures with us after the show,</v>

1667
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 3>the House of Blues in Houston and me and Ian Edwards talked about her every 20</v>

1668
00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:58.760
<v Speaker 3>minutes for the rest of the weekend.</v>

1669
00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.683
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1670
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.401
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1671
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:01.821
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1672
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 3>This waste leg is like your arm.</v>

1673
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 3>And then came and it was insane.</v>

1674
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>

1675
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.740
<v Speaker 3>And we would be,</v>

1676
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 3>we would be in the car and I would go that it just didn't seem like a real body.</v>

1677
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:14.631
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1678
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:16.040
<v Speaker 3>it didn't seem like a real body was like,</v>

1679
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:16.910
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck,</v>

1680
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:17.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1681
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not knocking her for doing it.</v>

1682
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 3>This is my thing.</v>

1683
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it.</v>

1684
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:23.330
<v Speaker 3>And then complain when people talk about it.</v>

1685
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.021
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1686
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1687
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.670
<v Speaker 3>like in other words,</v>

1688
00:43:25.671 --> 00:43:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Jennifer Lopez can never say,</v>

1689
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 3>why aren't you looking at my ass?</v>

1690
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:29.091
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1695
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.121
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them,</v>

1696
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 3>they started out,</v>

1697
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 3>they start out trying to sell it that way and then they want to be taken</v>

1698
00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

1710
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:51.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's part of you.</v>

1711
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.550

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1718
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.690
<v Speaker 3>beach volleyball players and they said,</v>

00:43:59.691 --> 00:43:59.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1720
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:01.390
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to wear bikinis.</v>

1721
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.900
<v Speaker 3>You can change the uniform.</v>

1722
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:03.681
<v Speaker 3>And all of them were like,</v>

1723
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:03.831
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1724
00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:03.951
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1725
00:44:03.951 --> 00:44:04.101
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1726
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:04.221
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1727
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:04.610
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1728
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 3>We were wearing the Bikini's cause they knew that they were like,</v>

1729
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.211
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1730
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 3>we want people to watch if we're wearing sweats.</v>

1731
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's watching beach volleyball.</v>

1732
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:19.751
<v Speaker 3>So I remember a knock when I first started doing comedy especially,</v>

1733
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I always was like real nervous about people seeing the fact that I had muscles</v>

1734
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 3>seeing the fact that it worked out because I always felt like that working out</v>

1735
00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.020
<v Speaker 3>and comedy word,</v>

1736
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.130
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't go together.</v>

1737
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:31.831
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

1738
00:44:31.831 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't,</v>

1739
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't have,</v>

1740
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't be built right.</v>

1741
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 3>And do stand up,</v>

1742
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:36.211
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1743
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 3>But then I met guys like you and then I met Nick Depaulo was the first one I met</v>

1744
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Nick Dipaolo in Boston does back when he was young.</v>

1745
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Speaker 3>He used to play football players,</v>

1746
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 3>big giant neck fucking,</v>

1747
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 3>and he was killing.</v>

1748
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1749
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:47.611
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1750
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:48.241
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>

1751
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is just be funny.</v>

1752
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1753
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.823
<v Speaker 3>To hide it.</v>

1754
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Early in my career I used to acknowledge it.</v>

1755
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 3>I've stopped even acknowledging it,</v>

1756
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's always funny to me when people are like,</v>

1757
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:57.384
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1758
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.351
<v Speaker 3>if they don't laugh,</v>

1759
00:44:58.351 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 3>you could just beat him up.</v>

1760
00:44:59.340 --> 00:44:59.611
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1761
00:44:59.611 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1762
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 3>that's my second strategy.</v>

1763
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what we do.</v>

1764
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.401
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1765
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 3>that's absolutely what I was going to do because I'm a fucking Viking and I'm</v>

1766
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:10.450
<v Speaker 3>just going to jump into the crowd and start beating the shit out of this is</v>

1767
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.870
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

1768
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:11.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1769
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1770
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 3>The idea that uh,</v>

1771
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another like a person who's fit or you have a good body or something</v>

1772
00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 3>that that precludes you from being smart.</v>

1773
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a big thing with girls.</v>

1774
00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Like if a girl is a hot body,</v>

1775
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:27.060
<v Speaker 3>thinks she's gotta be a fucking idiot instantaneously you see grown in the</v>

1776
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:29.280
<v Speaker 3>beginning a bikini with a nice body,</v>

1777
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 3>a good percentage of the population wants to write her off because it's an easy</v>

1778
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:33.924
<v Speaker 3>ride for her.</v>

1779
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Cause if,</v>

1780
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 3>cause we know that if you are built like that,</v>

1781
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 3>the odds that you're doing the work,</v>

1782
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:42.030
<v Speaker 3>the odds that you're really studying shit and reading shit and paying attention</v>

1783
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 3>and really analyzing your thoughts and being objective and correcting mistakes,</v>

1784
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1785
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 3>probably not cause you got dick thrown at you like javelins all day long.</v>

1786
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 3>You're just dodging deck.</v>

1787
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean a girl like that,</v>

1788
00:45:52.811 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1789
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to rest on your laurels,</v>

1790
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.130
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean that,</v>

1791
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.510
<v Speaker 3>that to judge them on that.</v>

1792
00:45:58.511 --> 00:45:58.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1793
00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 3>if you've met enough people in your life,</v>

1794
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 3>you realize that there's some really hot chicks that are smart as fuck.</v>

1795
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1796
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.613
<v Speaker 3>It's confusing.</v>

1797
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

1798
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.353
<v Speaker 3>But they're out there,</v>

1799
00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.231
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>

1800
00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1801
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.213
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1802
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like they say,</v>

1803
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:14.040
<v Speaker 3>and I found this to be true to the most amazing women are the ones who got hot</v>

1804
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 3>after high school.</v>

1805
00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1806
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:16.941
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1808
00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1809
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.570
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1810
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:17.980
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1811
00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1812
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.890
<v Speaker 3>because they had to,</v>

1813
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.860
<v Speaker 3>they had a personality and they were smart or this or that.</v>

1814
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:26.880
<v Speaker 3>And then they hit their 20s and they kind of figured out how all the parts come</v>

1815
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:28.170
<v Speaker 3>together and became like,</v>

1816
00:46:28.171 --> 00:46:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit hot.</v>

1817
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 3>They still have that.</v>

1818
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 3>They develop that personality or whatever.</v>

1819
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you're born hot and you just look great all your life,</v>

1820
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:37.614
<v Speaker 3>and I've met,</v>

1821
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.080
<v Speaker 3>I've met women like this that they have no clue.</v>

1822
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Like they really think life is that easy for everyone.</v>

1823
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1824
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

1825
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 3>it's like you understand like everyone,</v>

1826
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:53.571
<v Speaker 3>like some people have to wait in line for shit club is some people like,</v>

1827
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:54.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1828
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1829
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 3>it's no knock against him.</v>

1830
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:56.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1831
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1832
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.460
<v Speaker 3>certain people when the birth lottery,</v>

1833
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:00.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1834
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:04.800
<v Speaker 3>you just want like Michael Jordan ability to fly.</v>

1835
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1836
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.290
<v Speaker 3>But Michael Jordan is a perfect example.</v>

1837
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:07.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1838
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jordan didn't even make his high school team,</v>

1839
00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:10.134
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jordan,</v>

1840
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 3>he failed like a lot and then become obsessed,</v>

1841
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 3>became obsessed with success.</v>

1842
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.440
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1843
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 3>but then he also happened to grow to six,</v>

1844
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:20.670
<v Speaker 3>seven with the jumping ability.</v>

1845
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:21.211
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1846
00:47:21.211 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like that was that,</v>

1847
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.641
<v Speaker 3>that helped.</v>

1848
00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:24.001
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1849
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:24.271
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1850
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:25.920
<v Speaker 3>it's great when you do all of that,</v>

1851
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 3>but you still have to have,</v>

1852
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.340
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to have some talent.</v>

1853
00:47:29.341 --> 00:47:29.791
<v Speaker 3>It's like being,</v>

1854
00:47:29.791 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like comics,</v>

1855
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1856
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought Dave Chappelle had an unfair advantage because Dave looked</v>

1857
00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:38.440
<v Speaker 3>funny when he came out and I don't,</v>

1858
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz,</v>

1859
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that as a knock.</v>

1860
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean like when you see him on stage before he opened his mouth,</v>

1861
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1862
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:43.751
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1863
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 3>this guy's,</v>

1864
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 3>this guy looks funny.</v>

1865
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.630
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be fun.</v>

1866
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:48.040
<v Speaker 3>You know Joey's like that.</v>

1867
00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:49.690
<v Speaker 3>When Joey starts talking,</v>

1868
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:50.441
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1869
00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:53.470
<v Speaker 3>this guy's hilarious because you think Joey,</v>

1870
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Joey's one of those guys.</v>

1871
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:57.030
<v Speaker 3>You he'd like a rocky look ports.</v>

1872
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Another one where you think they're playing a character and then you find out,</v>

1873
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:01.121
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1874
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 3>this is really him.</v>

1875
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 3>He's really that guy.</v>

1876
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 3>So it makes it even funnier if Joey's a human cartoon.</v>

1877
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just walks out and as soon as he walks on stage,</v>

1878
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 3>people start laughing.</v>

1879
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 3>They start smiling.</v>

1880
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1881
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.150
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is this guy been doing for the past 15 years?</v>

1882
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I love Joey Man.</v>

1883
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 3>He's my favorite of all time.</v>

1884
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the funniest guy that's ever lived.</v>

1885
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.893
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1886
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:23.451
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1887
00:48:23.451 --> 00:48:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anybody any funnier because I think if you look at common</v>

1888
00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:27.820
<v Speaker 3>and you look at stand up comedy,</v>

1889
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I really think that we're right now we're in the golden age.</v>

1890
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's ever been more funny comics.</v>

1891
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I think too because of the great comics because the Internet guys like Joey that</v>

1892
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 3>probably would have never made it on television and they wouldn't have gotten a</v>

1893
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 3>shot on the tonight show back in the day.</v>

1894
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Now you get to find out how funny they really are from podcasts and you get to</v>

1895
00:48:45.371 --> 00:48:50.371
<v Speaker 3>go see them do stand up and I think if you look at like all the greats,</v>

1896
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.840
<v Speaker 3>like if you go back in time,</v>

1897
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Speaker 3>comedy gets better over the years,</v>

1898
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 3>like the greatest of all time.</v>

1899
00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Like only Richard Pryor is,</v>

1900
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 3>he's the one guy that like,</v>

1901
00:49:00.851 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll go back and I'll listen to his old stuff and it's still really funny.</v>

1902
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 3>It's still really funny but like you go back and listen to Lenny Bruce,</v>

1903
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

1904
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.410
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to listen to them and it's not really funny anymore.</v>

1905
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I think Carlin was always funny once he,</v>

1906
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.140
<v Speaker 3>once he got past that Hippie weatherman thing,</v>

1907
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.220
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>

1908
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 3>once he put that down,</v>

1909
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Carlin became just these,</v>

1910
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean the observations he made were hilarious.</v>

1911
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:25.371
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1912
00:49:25.371 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 3>and Cosby and I,</v>

1913
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1914
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.210
<v Speaker 3>obviously everything,</v>

1915
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 3>everything with Cosby is now tainted.</v>

1916
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1917
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:32.111
<v Speaker 3>Cause,</v>

1918
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:33.060
<v Speaker 3>but he's still omic.</v>

1919
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1920
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Was,</v>

1921
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.630
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

1922
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 3>he was a beast.</v>

1923
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you listen to it,</v>

1924
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Noah's Ark and some of that old shit and it's like genius.</v>

1925
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.421
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

1926
00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Like it would still be,</v>

1927
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:41.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1928
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 3>we had this argument once somebody threw it out,</v>

1929
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:44.651
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

1930
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:46.330
<v Speaker 3>if caused me started today,</v>

1931
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 3>would he have made it?</v>

1932
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:47.891
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1933
00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:48.540
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

1934
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1935
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1936
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.630
<v Speaker 3>He knew the adjusted,</v>

1937
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.120
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1938
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:51.420
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1939
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 3>they all would have adjusted to the new level of comedy.</v>

1940
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 3>The level of comedy is hire people expect more.</v>

1941
00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:58.481
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1942
00:49:58.481 --> 00:49:59.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's higher now.</v>

1943
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1944
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I just think that as time goes on,</v>

1945
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.033
<v Speaker 3>things get better.</v>

1946
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1947
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 3>but at all the guys that I've ever seen,</v>

1948
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 3>and I saw Kennison live,</v>

1949
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 3>I s I worked with prior at the end a bunch of times at the comedy store,</v>

1950
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't really prior anymore.</v>

1951
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.840
<v Speaker 3>He was real sick and he was in a wheelchair at the time and they,</v>

1952
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.210
<v Speaker 3>they would literally carry him chewy from the comedy store and,</v>

1953
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.803
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1954
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.703
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1955
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:24.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1956
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.270
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1957
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:26.140
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is her name?</v>

1958
00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1959
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.311
<v Speaker 3>Martinez,</v>

1960
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is her name?</v>

1961
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Anyone.</v>

1962
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 3>They would carry her,</v>

1963
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.201
<v Speaker 3>they would carry him,</v>

1964
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:34.034
<v Speaker 3>they would carry,</v>

1965
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 3>her husband would carry,</v>

1966
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1967
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor through the audience and sit him down and then they would crank</v>

1968
00:50:41.151 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 3>the microphone.</v>

1969
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1970
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Shh,</v>

1971
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 3>real loud.</v>

1972
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Cause he,</v>

1973
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 3>he could barely talk and he was on medication and he would drink and he would</v>

1974
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 3>drink and he would talk.</v>

1975
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 3>And it just wasn't that good and it was sad.</v>

1976
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1977
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.510
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1978
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 3>but I did get a chance to see him,</v>

1979
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1980
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 3>when I was younger,</v>

1981
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:56.791
<v Speaker 3>I saw him,</v>

1982
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1983
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.130
<v Speaker 3>live in the sunset strip.</v>

1984
00:50:58.131 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I saw the movies and then I saw prior,</v>

1985
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I saw Carlin live a few times.</v>

1986
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 3>No one has ever made me laugh.</v>

1987
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Like Joey Diaz when that guy's on,</v>

1988
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 3>when he's on and he went,</v>

1989
00:51:10.221 --> 00:51:13.490
<v Speaker 3>his face is red and he's fucking screaming and going crazy.</v>

1990
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1991
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anybody better.</v>

1992
00:51:15.561 --> 00:51:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the funny,</v>

1993
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I think overall he's the funniest guy that's ever lived.</v>

1994
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1995
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.493
<v Speaker 3>I got to,</v>

1996
00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:22.443
<v Speaker 3>I got to work with,</v>

1997
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1998
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Carlin and I met Cosby.</v>

1999
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Never got to work with him,</v>

2000
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 3>but I never got to meet prior.</v>

2001
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:33.050
<v Speaker 3>He was the only one last summer I worked with Rickles railing.</v>

2002
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Rickles is,</v>

2003
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 3>he's in his late eighties and it's the same thing.</v>

2004
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Like he's off stage.</v>

2005
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:38.960
<v Speaker 3>They haven't been a wheelchair.</v>

2006
00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:39.681
<v Speaker 3>He can walk,</v>

2007
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:43.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's like they helped them get around and then they bring them out and then</v>

2008
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 3>he sits at a piano and the minute the lights hit,</v>

2009
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking Rickles.</v>

2010
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.161
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2011
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 3>One of the highlights of my life,</v>

2012
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I got it on video is backstage.</v>

2013
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Rickles was ripping on me.</v>

2014
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.533
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2015

2021
00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:08.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2023

2030
00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 3>He said once he went to the lights are on and the microphone's on.</v>

2031
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:25.940
<v Speaker 3>He comes alive.</v>

2047
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

2048
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2049
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I was on the show,</v>

2050
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to say shoemaker was on his show.</v>

2051
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.353
<v Speaker 3>And Anyway,</v>

2052
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.400
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just outside.</v>

2053
00:52:58.401 --> 00:52:59.510
<v Speaker 3>This is when I still smoke,</v>

2054
00:52:59.511 --> 00:53:00.380
<v Speaker 3>so I'm having a cigarette.</v>

2055
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 3>So Buddy Hackett walks up,</v>

2056
00:53:01.641 --> 00:53:01.851
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2057
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 3>I've never met him.</v>

2058
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody.</v>

2059
00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 3>It's right after dawn and I missed it.</v>

2060
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:07.320
<v Speaker 3>The nappy headed hosting.</v>

2061
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.211
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2062
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 3>So he comes up to me,</v>

2063
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:09.531
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2064
00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:09.771
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2065
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:10.604
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2066
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.770
<v Speaker 3>I know you're going to let it happen.</v>

2067
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.011
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2068
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Cause you black comics when it comes to being funny,</v>

2069
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean the colors you colored guys are just so hilarious when you negro start,</v>

2070
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Jesse keeps going says keeps going.</v>

2071
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Saying the same thing.</v>

2072
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Different words for black and I am fucking cracking up because it's like,</v>

2073
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:30.323
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

2074
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:34.260
<v Speaker 3>But it was great.</v>

2075
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.093
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

2076
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

2077
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 3>those guys were,</v>

2078
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:37.770
<v Speaker 3>they had a thing,</v>

2079
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2080
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 3>it's different time at a different time and they had a camaraderie and a,</v>

2081
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and when they were,</v>

2082
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.020
<v Speaker 3>when they weren't on TV or on screen or whatever,</v>

2083
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:49.520
<v Speaker 3>they had no filter like they just did.</v>

2084
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 3>That's why he was doing that because you know back in the day that's what you,</v>

2085
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:54.503
<v Speaker 3>that's what you did,</v>

2086
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 3>what you did.</v>

2087
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 3>They fucked around with each other and they,</v>

2088
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 3>those guys didn't even have comedy clubs.</v>

2089
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:00.960
<v Speaker 3>Those guys had to start off on variety shows.</v>

2090
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2091
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Whether it'd be like a dancer or a band and they'd be like the NMC and they'd</v>

2092
00:54:05.461 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 3>have to come out and you know,</v>

2093
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 3>shuck and Jive and it would mc strip clubs and jazz clubs.</v>

2094
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 3>You ever had to a strip club?</v>

2095
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.133
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2096
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I did once I did a Jack and Jill Strip club in Woonsocket,</v>

2097
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:18.204
<v Speaker 3>Rhode Island,</v>

2098
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Jack and Jill means a guy goes out and the girl goes out.</v>

2099
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.201
<v Speaker 3>It was atrocious.</v>

2100
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:25.770
<v Speaker 3>There was no one in the audience and there was maybe like a no,</v>

2101
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:26.460
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit.</v>

2102
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Like six people in the audience spread out like two here,</v>

2103
00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 3>one over there,</v>

2104
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.413
<v Speaker 3>three over there.</v>

2105
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.270
<v Speaker 3>It was so bad that I couldn't even,</v>

2106
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't even say I bombed because there was no response.</v>

2107
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2108
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 3>it didn't feel like a bombing.</v>

2109
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.830
<v Speaker 3>It felt like they weren't even acknowledging that I was alive.</v>

2110
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 3>It was the strangest thing ever.</v>

2111
00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 3>And then this guy and this girl who are both equally unattractive,</v>

2112
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.270
<v Speaker 3>the guy would dance first.</v>

2113
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who danced first guy or the girl,</v>

2114
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.250
<v Speaker 3>but they were both disgusting and they both had terrible tattoos.</v>

2115
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 3>The guy was coverage tattoos up with like I on his arm and the girl had like the</v>

2116
00:54:57.331 --> 00:54:59.310
<v Speaker 3>way I described it on her ass,</v>

2117
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:04.311
<v Speaker 3>it looked like someone tried to chew into her ass like that ubid into hand,</v>

2118
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 3>got the ink on your teeth and tried to chew a snake into her ass.</v>

2119
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 3>That's how bad the tattoo looked.</v>

2120
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.010
<v Speaker 3>It was just a,</v>

2121
00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:13.800
<v Speaker 3>it was one of those moments where I go,</v>

2122
00:55:13.801 --> 00:55:14.161
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2123
00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to forget this place.</v>

2124
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 3>I did have a moment.</v>

2125
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I worked with the chip and Dales guys.</v>

2126
00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:18.640
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

2127
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is hosting a straight,</v>

2128
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:20.611
<v Speaker 3>anybody try to blow,</v>

2129
00:55:20.611 --> 00:55:21.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2130
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.280
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know I wasn't their type,</v>

2131
00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.253
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2132
00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 3>it was some little casino,</v>

2133
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:27.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
00:55:27.751 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 3>one of those sides of the road casino is about an hour and a half north of</v>

2135
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:32.124
<v Speaker 3>Sacramento.</v>

2136
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.780
<v Speaker 3>So we're in the middle of farm country and you know what,</v>

2137
00:55:35.781 --> 00:55:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

2138
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.811
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2139
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:38.340
<v Speaker 3>here's a casino for no reason.</v>

2140
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Had to be 1500 farmers' wives,</v>

2141
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 3>chicks in this crowd waiting for the chip and Dales guys.</v>

2142
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:48.091
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2143
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 3>So I go out there,</v>

2144
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:54.950
<v Speaker 3>so I'm out there for about maybe 12 seconds before the first take it off,</v>

2145
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:56.400
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2146
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.730
<v Speaker 3>And it just was one of those did just screaming right.</v>

2147
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:00.001
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2148
00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:00.751
<v Speaker 3>so whatever.</v>

2149
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't,</v>

2150
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even do jokes.</v>

2151
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I just yelled back at him and,</v>

2152
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 3>and something in and I would like open a button on my shirt,</v>

2153
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:09.953
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2154
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.820
<v Speaker 3>But the funny thing was like it was almost like they weren't in on it.</v>

2155
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Like they were trying to fuck the chip and Dales guys,</v>

2156
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.010
<v Speaker 3>you know these guys are like,</v>

2157
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of like it's a lottery thing to find.</v>

2158
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.921
<v Speaker 3>Which one of these,</v>

2159
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:24.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a straight guy.</v>

2160
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing was these guys were kids.</v>

2161
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:28.954
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

2162
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:29.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2163
00:56:29.771 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's a Chippendale's road crew.</v>

2164
00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the main guys.</v>

2278
00:59:09.281 --> 00:59:11.810
<v Speaker 3>There's no one nighter where you,</v>

2279
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.480
<v Speaker 3>where it is a possibility of you sucking a guy's Dick because they know us.</v>

2280
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:16.241
<v Speaker 3>You're a gay dude.</v>

2281
00:59:16.241 --> 00:59:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're a gate and you're trying to hook it up if you're trying.</v>

2282
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:19.061

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2287
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Nor is there a Gig for chicks where they wind up,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's,</v>

2293
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 3>it's different for women on the road though,</v>

2294
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:35.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2295
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't go out and get,</v>

2296
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.440
<v Speaker 3>their whole energy is different.</v>

2297
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:41.590
<v Speaker 3>They get sad there.</v>

2298
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Their whole energy is,</v>

2299
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:43.991

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 3>They know and don't like,</v>

2302
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:47.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't want Dick.</v>

2303
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you showing me a dick.</v>

2304
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Don't they usually bring dogs with them?</v>

2305
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:52.340
<v Speaker 3>They bring a little dog.</v>

2306
00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them have dogs and little tiny dog.</v>

2307
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 3>The weirdest thing I heard after we did last comic,</v>

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like,</v>

2453
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 3>like genuinely confused.</v>

2454
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.820
<v Speaker 3>He never figured it out.</v>

2455
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy who needed someone to take care of him.</v>

2456
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:46.460
<v Speaker 3>He needed a manager.</v>

2457
01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:46.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:03:46.651 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 3>He needed a man in here that would,</v>

2459
01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2460
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.560
<v Speaker 3>handle and take care of him,</v>

2461
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:50.680
<v Speaker 3>which he didn't book them.</v>

2462
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Just get them booked.</v>

2463
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:52.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2464
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:55.230
<v Speaker 3>it's just like having him manage his career on his own.</v>

2465
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Did he ever have a manager?</v>

2466
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.240
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2467
01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.570
<v Speaker 3>he was with Barry briefly.</v>

2468
01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.453
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2469
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:01.543
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2470
01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.101
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2472
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>

2473
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.300
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2474
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:03.720
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2475
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 3>we toured with him for a while,</v>

2476
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:08.630
<v Speaker 3>meet him and Gary Goldman toward for about six months really.</v>

2477
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.653
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2478
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.010
<v Speaker 3>me and Goldman would call it London itis where you just get tired of Jay.</v>

2479
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:14.821
<v Speaker 3>Like you love him.</v>

2480
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:15.301
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

2481
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it anymore,</v>

2482
01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2483
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.040
<v Speaker 3>But he knew he needed somebody to help him.</v>

2484
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 3>It was fucked up because it was,</v>

2485
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.580
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those cases where if somebody worked with him,</v>

2486
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 3>he could have sustained it.</v>

2487
01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:25.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2488
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy who could just come in and do 10 minute guest spots forever and</v>

2489
01:04:30.661 --> 01:04:31.530
<v Speaker 3>people would love him.</v>

2490
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:31.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2491
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:36.951
<v Speaker 3>he opened up for Louie recently in La at the comedy store when Louie was warming</v>

2492
01:04:37.111 --> 01:04:37.891
<v Speaker 3>up for his,</v>

2493
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:40.140
<v Speaker 3>a standup special that he filmed there.</v>

2494
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.280
<v Speaker 3>And he was really funny,</v>

2495
01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2496
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:42.950
<v Speaker 3>He's got some great one liners.</v>

2497
01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 3>He's got some killer one had crabs.</v>

2498
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I bought a fishnet stockings.</v>

2499
01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:49.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll be over here,</v>

2500
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:51.080
<v Speaker 3>like move the microphone.</v>

2501
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:51.871
<v Speaker 3>He went in on a joke,</v>

2502
01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:52.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't go well.</v>

2503
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.860
<v Speaker 3>He's the only guy I know who could honestly do the same joke twice in,</v>

2504
01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.070
<v Speaker 3>in one set because he forgot.</v>

2505
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 3>And the crowd would laugh because everyone knew,</v>

2506
01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:03.090
<v Speaker 3>like he honestly forgot.</v>

2507
01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 3>He's already told that joke,</v>

2508
01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.570
<v Speaker 3>but they were all nonsequitors.</v>

2509
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.060
<v Speaker 3>It was like one after the other that didn't,</v>

2510
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 3>that didn't make sense.</v>

2511
01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:11.760

2535
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:41.951
<v Speaker 4>Like those are jokes.</v>

2536
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Like you did a joke from a movie,</v>

2537
01:05:43.331 --> 01:05:44.470
<v Speaker 4>the movie boiler room,</v>

2538
01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 4>which I guess they stole from Jim David,</v>

2539
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 4>who's a comic in New York.</v>

2540

2541
01:05:51.311 --> 01:05:51.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2542

2552
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't even make any sense out of it yet.</v>

2553
01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2554

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:08.030
<v Speaker 4>when you're onstage,</v>

2561
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be your point of view.</v>

2562
01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:10.780
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what everybody wants to go say.</v>

2563
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:11.261
<v Speaker 4>They want to see,</v>

2564
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 4>here's the world through your eyes.</v>

2565
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Buddy Hackett just started screaming at me.</v>

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 4>They all would steal each other's shit and they would go from town to town and</v>

2571
01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:28.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2572
01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:32.350
<v Speaker 4>they would do jokes to Jews walking into a bar and then they would have like a</v>

2573
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 4>little thing that they would piece together because no one did television back</v>

2574
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:36.010

<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew.</v>

2577
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.793
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew anything.</v>

2578
01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 4>He just had a bunch of gags.</v>

2579
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:42.670
<v Speaker 4>It was like your toolbox that you'd bring with you need to go and do it.</v>

2580
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.760
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2581
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.593
<v Speaker 4>this is the only,</v>

2582
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:45.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2583
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.380
<v Speaker 4>we all knew that everyone knew that as comics.</v>

2587
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:51.190
<v Speaker 4>They would always talk about that.</v>

2588
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Like the Milton Berle thing was the classic one,</v>

2589
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2590

<v Speaker 4>He had gloves on.</v>

2596
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.280
<v Speaker 4>And I remember trying to figure out what I was going to do.</v>

2597
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2598
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:08.600
<v Speaker 4>am I going to yell back at Buddy Hall?</v>

2599
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.861
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2600
01:07:08.861 --> 01:07:09.850
<v Speaker 4>fucking our buddy,</v>

2601
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:10.684
<v Speaker 4>a hacker brother.</v>

2602
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 4>He's like 80 something years old.</v>

2603
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 4>He means it looks like he's on death's door and he's a legend.</v>

2604
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:16.181
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2605
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:17.830
<v Speaker 4>he's a comedy legend and you know,</v>

2606
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 4>and he's screaming at me and I,</v>

2607
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:23.590
<v Speaker 4>and I know why screaming at me and am I going to say you're just pissed off</v>

2608
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 4>because your entire career stole.</v>

2609
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 4>That's what you guys did.</v>

2610
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.290
<v Speaker 4>You guys all still,</v>

2611
01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:27.980
<v Speaker 4>you weren't,</v>

2612
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.400
<v Speaker 4>you're with standup was back then is not stand up now.</v>

2613
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:31.000
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2614
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.560
<v Speaker 4>this is all in my mind and I'm not,</v>

2615
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:33.394
<v Speaker 4>I can't say that.</v>

2616
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.091
<v Speaker 4>I just can't say it.</v>

2617
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:34.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2618
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.351
<v Speaker 4>it's not my place.</v>

2619
01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll be crucified.</v>

2620
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 4>So I decided to just eat it.</v>

2621
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to say a word.</v>

2622
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 4>So I just sit there while he's screaming at me and I'm looking at them and I</v>

2623
01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:43.541
<v Speaker 4>don't say a word,</v>

2624
01:07:43.541 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 4>and I think to myself like,</v>

2625
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:45.100
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2626
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:45.671
<v Speaker 4>did I do the right?</v>

2627
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:45.851
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2628
01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

2629
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.030
<v Speaker 4>And then fucking Barry came over.</v>

2630
01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:49.330
<v Speaker 4>W who I've never liked.</v>

2631
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.291
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like me,</v>

2632
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:51.124
<v Speaker 4>I don't like him.</v>

2633
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Speaker 4>And he was the producer of the show and it was that weird controversy where all</v>

2634
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:55.150
<v Speaker 4>the people that got on the show,</v>

2635
01:07:55.151 --> 01:07:56.350
<v Speaker 4>even though we didn't vote for him,</v>

2636
01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.080
<v Speaker 4>they wound up getting in because Barry was managing them.</v>

2637
01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:02.350
<v Speaker 4>It was a disaster because he was producing the show and managing people that</v>

2638
01:08:02.351 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 4>were on the show.</v>

2639
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking gross.</v>

2640
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 4>That was when drew Carey and Brett Butler walked off the show in the second</v>

2641
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:09.200
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>

2642
01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.033
<v Speaker 4>Reason.</v>

2643
01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk to you about that.</v>

2644
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:12.401
<v Speaker 4>We'll do that next.</v>

2645
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2646
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 4>So I decide,</v>

2647
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:14.674
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2648
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.921
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna say anything.</v>

2649
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:17.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna say it and bury him.</v>

2650
01:08:17.121 --> 01:08:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Come,</v>

2651
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.263
<v Speaker 4>came over to me.</v>

2652
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2653
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 4>you're such a professional,</v>

2654
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:21.141

2659
01:08:24.001 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 4>And then way you did and that was beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>

2661

<v Speaker 4>you just handled it perfect.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

2664
01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:29.234
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

2665
01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:29.470

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.911
<v Speaker 4>like I'm so,</v>

2667
01:08:29.911 --> 01:08:30.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

2668
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2669
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:31.791
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

2670
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:32.091
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

2671
01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:33.110
<v Speaker 4>I definitely did the wrong thing.</v>

2672
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:34.490
<v Speaker 4>If Barry comes over and tells me that,</v>

2673
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.731
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

2674
01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:38.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2675
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:38.834
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2676
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 4>and then Monique was like,</v>

2677
01:08:40.581 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 4>you made those jokes.</v>

2678
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:42.463
<v Speaker 4>You all sugar.</v>

2679
01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:44.000
<v Speaker 4>Those are your jokes now.</v>

2680
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.020
<v Speaker 4>You made them yours.</v>

2681
01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2682
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Speaker 4>you made them yours.</v>

2683
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking George Carlin joke.</v>

2684
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.033
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

2685
01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:52.670
<v Speaker 4>He's doing the choke about George Carlin talking about how fighters fight for a</v>

2686
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:53.091
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

2687
01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:53.924
<v Speaker 4>They wear a belt.</v>

2688
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.040
<v Speaker 4>That's a Goddamn George Carlin bit and he's doing this and he's going to do it</v>

2689
01:08:58.041 --> 01:08:58.821
<v Speaker 4>on television.</v>

2690
01:08:58.821 --> 01:08:59.001
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2691
01:08:59.001 --> 01:08:59.331
<v Speaker 4>do you know what?</v>

2692
01:08:59.331 --> 01:08:59.750
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2693
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.830
<v Speaker 4>what's happening here?</v>

2694
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't say a word.</v>

2695
01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I just let it all happen.</v>

2696
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:03.913
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2697
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.880
<v Speaker 4>two weeks later,</v>

2698
01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 4>Buddy Hackett's dead two weeks.</v>

2699
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:12.670
<v Speaker 4>So his health was so fragile that him screaming at me at that moment,</v>

2700
01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 4>if I screamed back at him,</v>

2701
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.690
<v Speaker 4>he could've died on that show.</v>

2702
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:18.051
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2703
01:09:18.051 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 4>that's how fragile his health was.</v>

2704
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:20.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2705
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:20.864
<v Speaker 4>he was dead.</v>

2706
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to say two weeks.</v>

2707
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:23.240
<v Speaker 4>I might be wrong,</v>

2708
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 4>but it was no more than two months and he was dead.</v>

2709
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:28.460
<v Speaker 4>And so I was thinking like if I yelled at him there,</v>

2710
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.171
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

2711
01:09:29.171 --> 01:09:30.004
<v Speaker 2>you'll cut.</v>

2712
01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:32.100
<v Speaker 2>That would be a worst.</v>

2713
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2714
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.390
<v Speaker 2>His heart thing explodes.</v>

2715
01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2716
01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan kills Buddy Hackett.</v>

2717
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2718
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Literally killed him.</v>

2719
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Literally killed him.</v>

2720
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:41.930
<v Speaker 4>And this was all,</v>

2721
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2722
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I want to say this is all pre them and see,</v>

2723
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:45.584
<v Speaker 4>I think too,</v>

2724
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.700
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2725
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.500
<v Speaker 4>it was right when was the last comic standing?</v>

2726
01:09:48.501 --> 01:09:49.334
<v Speaker 4>What year?</v>

2727
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh five oh four oh five.</v>

2728
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 4>So this was pre cause of them and see anything was like 2007.</v>

2729
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2730
01:09:55.250 --> 01:10:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Well what happened with Brett and a drew Carey and I always felt that they set</v>

2731
01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:01.094
<v Speaker 2>them up,</v>

2732
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2733
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.680
<v Speaker 2>kind of set them up for this to happen.</v>

2734
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:06.470
<v Speaker 2>So we're doing it the semifinals in Vegas,</v>

2735
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.801
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2736
01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 2>There's 20 of us there and 10 of us are going to go forward into the house and</v>

2737
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:12.254
<v Speaker 2>do the show.</v>

2738
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So it came down to,</v>

2739
01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a,</v>

2740
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Dan that are Herman and somebody else.</v>

2741
01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It was between the two of them.</v>

2742
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:24.830
<v Speaker 2>And Nat Herman had had a killer set.</v>

2743
01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:25.664
<v Speaker 2>And I love anatomy.</v>

2744
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Anatomy is really funny,</v>

2745
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think they didn't see everything that led up to that.</v>

2746
01:10:32.721 --> 01:10:33.381
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2747
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:36.320
<v Speaker 2>we had done our auditions in our various cities.</v>

2748
01:10:36.321 --> 01:10:39.980
<v Speaker 2>We had done New York and they had us do some shit backstage.</v>

2749
01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Like we had a gambling night,</v>

2750
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.370
<v Speaker 2>we had a party and Dan doesn't really interact like it's,</v>

2751
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2752
01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot of comics.</v>

2753
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.730
<v Speaker 2>You stay to yourself like it's a thing.</v>

2754
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 2>And I think all of that made a difference in them picking.</v>

2755
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:58.040
<v Speaker 2>But they had Brett and drew under the impression that they were going to pick</v>

2756
01:10:58.041 --> 01:11:02.540
<v Speaker 2>the 10 that went cause like one of the other comics they picked wasn't going to</v>

2757
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:06.500
<v Speaker 2>get on cause they did the same set at both auditions and they kill you for that.</v>

2758
01:11:06.501 --> 01:11:06.891
<v Speaker 2>They would like,</v>

2759
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:07.101
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2760
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:10.160
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have two different three minutes sets,</v>

2761
01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:10.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2762
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:12.110
<v Speaker 2>you're not ready for the show or whatever.</v>

2763
01:11:12.111 --> 01:11:12.780
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

2764
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>So I felt they set uh,</v>

2765
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.161
<v Speaker 2>Brett up.</v>

2766
01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause I remember when Britain got pissed and got up out the chair and walked off</v>

2767
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 2>because I think we all knew that they weren't making the final decision.</v>

2768
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.591
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2769
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>They were like celebrity judges but they weren't going to,</v>

2770
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2771
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:29.430
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

2772
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you weren't really judging,</v>

2773
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.840
<v Speaker 2>they didn't take you into consideration at all producer's decision,</v>

2774
01:11:33.841 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 2>which is why it was so frustrating for people when they found out the barrier</v>

2775
01:11:37.321 --> 01:11:38.370
<v Speaker 2>was managing people.</v>

2776
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2777
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:39.331
<v Speaker 2>That one,</v>

2778
01:11:39.331 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 2>that one thing I can say when all that went down,</v>

2779
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.680
<v Speaker 2>I had no connection with anybody cause cause Barry managed some.</v>

2780
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm Ross,</v>

2781
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2782
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Bob and uh,</v>

2783
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Ross from the tonight show,</v>

2784
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.910
<v Speaker 2>they had had a management company before they were scouts for the tonight show.</v>

2785
01:11:57.150 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Speaker 2>And I think one or two of the comics had been with their management company</v>

2786
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:01.801
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2787
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:02.551
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

2788
01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.384
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

2789
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 2>check my history.</v>

2790
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.363
<v Speaker 2>I got nobody,</v>

2791
01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 2>no one pulling for me here.</v>

2792
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 2>But then I went back a few years later,</v>

2793
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 2>season five and I was one of the judges.</v>

2794
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 2>And so now I'm on the other side of the table and I got to say,</v>

2795
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it was when you did it.</v>

2796
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.430
<v Speaker 2>They didn't interfere with that.</v>

2797
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Like they didn't tell us who they want it,</v>

2798
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.841
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2799
01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Like they didn't really,</v>

2800
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Speaker 2>the only thing they would tell us if somebody did that act before,</v>

2801
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:28.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2802
01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:29.071
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

2803
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:34.071
<v Speaker 2>like they tried out with it in oh five and now they're back in Oh six with the</v>

2804
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:35.004
<v Speaker 2>same act.</v>

2805
01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:35.761
<v Speaker 2>Cause they were like,</v>

2806
01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:35.941
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2807
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And then there were a couple of times I'll never forget,</v>

2808
01:12:38.191 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 2>there was this one,</v>

2809
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2810
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.070
<v Speaker 2>this chick had been like Miss New Jersey or something like that.</v>

2811
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Like she was a beauty queen and she was hot as hell.</v>

2812
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Not Funny at all,</v>

2813
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 2>but just fucking amazing to look at.</v>

2814
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:50.791
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2815
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:51.624
<v Speaker 2>So they were like,</v>

2816
01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:52.800
<v Speaker 2>are going to go in the house?</v>

2817
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.731
<v Speaker 2>I got to pass it.</v>

2818
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:53.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:12:53.861 --> 01:12:54.211
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2820
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:55.100
<v Speaker 2>you got a passer,</v>

2821
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you got to bring her back to the ninth audition.</v>

2822
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.043
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

2823
01:12:58.090 --> 01:12:58.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2824
01:12:58.530 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2825
01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2826
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not going to,</v>

2827
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 2>we brought her in when we were at Gotham's in New York.</v>

2828
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.943
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

2829
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 2>it was the most awkward silence like her act.</v>

2830
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:13.650
<v Speaker 2>It was like this monologue and just the crowd was just like,</v>

2831
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.050
<v Speaker 2>it's where it's not even bombing with it.</v>

2832
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2833
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 2>The look on your face right now.</v>

2834
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's a camera on you,</v>

2835
01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:20.401
<v Speaker 2>but if people,</v>

2836
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 2>if you saw the face Joe,</v>

2837
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:22.344
<v Speaker 2>just me.</v>

2838
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:24.091
<v Speaker 2>That was the whole,</v>

2839
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:24.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2840
01:13:24.331 --> 01:13:25.164
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that</v>

2841
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:27.511
<v Speaker 2>painful feeling.</v>

2842
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful little hidden short</v>

2843
01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

2844
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Look at her hair,</v>

2845
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:33.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2846
01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:33.984
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those,</v>

2847
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:34.840
<v Speaker 2>one of those,</v>

2848
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

2849
01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 2>What if she got good,</v>

2850
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:38.303
<v Speaker 2>like really good?</v>

2851
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Could have maybe.</v>

2852
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2853
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2854
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I think she would have,</v>

2855
01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.040
<v Speaker 2>she had been plucked into the actress pool if she was funny at all and even</v>

2856
01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:48.180
<v Speaker 2>remotely decent.</v>

2857
01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2858
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:50.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2859
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>They didn't tell us anything who they want and who they didn't,</v>

2860
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 2>but it was real obvious when we all like,</v>

2861
01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:58.110
<v Speaker 2>we would talk about it like before buddy got mad at me,</v>

2862
01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2863
01:13:59.311 --> 01:13:59.791
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2864
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:00.630
<v Speaker 2>did you guys pick them?</v>

2865
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:01.150
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>

2866
01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 2>how did this guy get through?</v>

2867
01:14:02.011 --> 01:14:02.401
<v Speaker 2>Like it was,</v>

2868
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:02.620
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2869
01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:02.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2870
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:05.400
<v Speaker 2>there was a conversation when we were trying to figure out how someone got</v>

2871
01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:05.731
<v Speaker 2>through that.</v>

2872
01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:07.560
<v Speaker 2>We didn't pick that none of us pick,</v>

2873
01:14:07.561 --> 01:14:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Monique didn't pick him.</v>

2874
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:09.391
<v Speaker 2>That was what it was.</v>

2875
01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I was talking to a buddy.</v>

2876
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I think Monique didn't pick him and I didn't pick them.</v>

2877
01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:12.791
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2878
01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you didn't pick them down and pick them.</v>

2879
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2880
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:14.381
<v Speaker 2>It goes,</v>

2881
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:16.300
<v Speaker 2>well how this guy get through that doesn't make any sense.</v>

2882
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:17.231
<v Speaker 2>And then there was,</v>

2883
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:18.064
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2884
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:18.641
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2885
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2886
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.490
<v Speaker 2>the Brett Butler thing and then we had read that the,</v>

2887
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:27.190
<v Speaker 2>the judges would really just sort of for show and that really is the producer's</v>

2888
01:14:27.191 --> 01:14:29.070
<v Speaker 2>decision who to get on and knocking on the shelf.</v>

2889
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately.</v>

2890
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately it was because part of it,</v>

2891
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:32.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2892
01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 2>like I was talking with Jay,</v>

2893
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Katie Anderson about it,</v>

2894
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>cause KP was working on a show.</v>

2895
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>He was writing for Jay,</v>

2896
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:42.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2897
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:43.383
<v Speaker 2>And Kp say,</v>

2898
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.661
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2899
01:14:43.661 --> 01:14:43.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2900
01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 2>well part of it is you gotta have a balance in comics,</v>

2901
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.771
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2902
01:14:47.771 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So you can't have like all white guys are all black guys or is it like they had</v>

2903
01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:54.190
<v Speaker 2>an idea of how many slots,</v>

2904
01:14:54.191 --> 01:14:57.850
<v Speaker 2>cause he told me to think when the season I went on with Corey Holcomb.</v>

2905
01:14:57.851 --> 01:14:58.121
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2906
01:14:58.121 --> 01:14:58.954
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2907
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:01.560
<v Speaker 2>they only thought there'd be one black comic.</v>

2908
01:15:01.561 --> 01:15:02.320
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2909
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:07.320
<v Speaker 2>but you and Cory were both so funny and so completely different that they were</v>

2910
01:15:08.351 --> 01:15:08.951
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2911
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2912
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 2>bring them both on.</v>

2913
01:15:10.391 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 2>And then when it came down to,</v>

2914
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.760
<v Speaker 2>there were six of us and fought going to be five finalists.</v>

2915
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2916
01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.840
<v Speaker 2>And me and Cory were both still in the running and we were like,</v>

2917
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.500
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2918
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.580
<v Speaker 2>one of us ain't gonna make it.</v>

2919
01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Like it ain't gonna be two brothers in the final five on NBC.</v>

2920
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 2>That just ain't going to happen.</v>

2921
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:28.300
<v Speaker 2>So whichever one of us makes it,</v>

2922
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:29.231
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2923
01:15:29.231 --> 01:15:29.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2924
01:15:29.531 --> 01:15:30.850
<v Speaker 2>we were back the other one,</v>

2925
01:15:30.851 --> 01:15:31.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2926
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:32.341
<v Speaker 2>cause we knew,</v>

2927
01:15:32.341 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 2>we knew that doesn't make any sense.</v>

2928
01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:35.560
<v Speaker 2>If you guys were the two best,</v>

2929
01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>it should be a possibility.</v>

2930
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2931
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:39.343
<v Speaker 2>Should be.</v>

2932
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:40.811
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

2933
01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:41.111
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2934
01:15:41.111 --> 01:15:42.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just that show.</v>

2935
01:15:42.431 --> 01:15:43.001
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2936
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:43.181
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2937
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:44.440
<v Speaker 2>that's how TV works.</v>

2938
01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:44.891
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

2939
01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2940
01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:49.690
<v Speaker 2>I've always said that like when people talk about discrimination and TV,</v>

2941
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:51.760
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely discrimination in TV,</v>

2942
01:15:51.761 --> 01:15:52.541
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it,</v>

2943
01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:54.580
<v Speaker 2>but one of the colors they see as green,</v>

2944
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:55.961
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2945
01:15:55.961 --> 01:15:57.190
<v Speaker 2>And some of the shit they do,</v>

2946
01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 2>like when they do stereotypes,</v>

2947
01:15:58.511 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about it earlier,</v>

2948
01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2949
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.230
<v Speaker 2>like Friday night I was one doctor Ken show as a bouncer.</v>

2950
01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2951
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I fucking nail bouncer.</v>

2952
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.111
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2953
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I've been a bouncer on most sitcoms in more movies have,</v>

2954
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2955
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:12.311
<v Speaker 2>could I,</v>

2956
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:13.450
<v Speaker 2>could I get mad and say,</v>

2957
01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:13.631
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2958
01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:13.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2959
01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I can play a professor.</v>

2960
01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:15.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I could,</v>

2961
01:16:15.811 --> 01:16:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but I damn sure I could play bouncer.</v>

2962
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:18.390
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2963
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:20.230
<v Speaker 2>And it's like that's how TV works,</v>

2964
01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:20.441
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2965
01:16:20.441 --> 01:16:25.441
<v Speaker 2>Like every hot blonde is dumb on TV and every Sitcom Dad is a bumbling idiot,</v>

2966
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2967
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.140
<v Speaker 2>And it's like that's,</v>

2968
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:28.993
<v Speaker 2>that's how they,</v>

2969
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.820
<v Speaker 2>that's how they play the game.</v>

2970
01:16:30.821 --> 01:16:33.250
<v Speaker 2>So you can get mad at it to an extent.</v>

2971
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:35.020
<v Speaker 2>And I understood like,</v>

2972
01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 2>like the Emmy speech that Viola Davis made,</v>

2973
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:38.920
<v Speaker 2>like I get that.</v>

2974
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:39.671
<v Speaker 2>Like she's like,</v>

2975
01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>if we had more opportunities,</v>

2976
01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.940
<v Speaker 2>there would be more black actresses like me and that,</v>

2977
01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:49.260
<v Speaker 2>and I never want to insult people who act on that level by lumping myself in</v>

2978
01:16:50.621 --> 01:16:51.311
<v Speaker 2>that category.</v>

2979
01:16:51.311 --> 01:16:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not an actor like the,</v>

2980
01:16:52.931 --> 01:16:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I am a,</v>

2981
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I love playing the bouncer.</v>

2982
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.460
<v Speaker 2>It's easy and I get health insurance,</v>

2983
01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:58.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2984
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:59.561
<v Speaker 2>but as a common,</v>

2985
01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:03.550
<v Speaker 2>so you're a professional comics and legit professional comic and the idea that</v>

2986
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2987
01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have you and Corey Holcomb,</v>

2988
01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.350
<v Speaker 2>who's also a legit professional comic.</v>

2989
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:09.184
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

2990
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:09.921
<v Speaker 2>You too.</v>

2991
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:10.581
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious guys.</v>

2992
01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 2>That it's not possible that you can get it to the finals.</v>

2993
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:14.090
<v Speaker 2>That's fuck it was possible.</v>

2994
01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 2>But we kind of knew he knew of the possible who you like this,</v>

2995
01:17:17.961 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 2>this the on UPN.</v>

2996

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.540

2998
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It would've been,</v>

2999
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 2>they would've been,</v>

3000
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3001
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.431
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3002
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:28.930

01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:29.160

<v Speaker 2>we got to see you later.</v>

3005
01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Corey got business to take care of.</v>

3006
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3007
01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:33.941
<v Speaker 2>at least half.</v>

3008
01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Ron's funny.</v>

3010
01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 2>And after all the dust settled,</v>

3011
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 2>like we were all cool with it.</v>

3012
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:41.661
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3013
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Like it was,</v>

3014
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:45.560
<v Speaker 2>it was what it was and it was a great shot for all of us.</v>

3015
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.540
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

3016
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I liked it better than than I do now.</v>

3017
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I think the show was better when you had all the reality and all that cause I</v>

3018
01:17:53.751 --> 01:17:56.950
<v Speaker 2>think now it's just straight stand up really.</v>

3019
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.351
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3020
01:17:57.351 --> 01:17:57.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3021
01:17:57.661 --> 01:18:02.661
<v Speaker 2>it's like they just get up and do stand up against each other and America votes.</v>

3022
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

3023
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 2>America don't even know if America votes or I don't even know how they do it now</v>

3024
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:08.241
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>

3025
01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:08.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3026
01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:09.081
<v Speaker 2>when we did it,</v>

3027
01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:10.880
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have Twitter and shit like that.</v>

3028
01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:11.960
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

3029
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't lie.</v>

3030
01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I did it when we had my space and I had a girlfriend who would get mad at me</v>

3031
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.540
<v Speaker 2>because of things chicks would post on my space after they saw me on TV.</v>

3032
01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I got no control over this.</v>

3033
01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:28.370
<v Speaker 2>She would get mad at you for things.</v>

3034
01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Other people posted it.</v>

3035
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:30.254
<v Speaker 2>She gets,</v>

3036
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:30.981
<v Speaker 2>she never,</v>

3037
01:18:30.981 --> 01:18:33.980
<v Speaker 2>she was never able to adjust to TV.</v>

3038
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:35.181
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3039
01:18:35.181 --> 01:18:35.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3040
01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3041
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.853
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3042
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:41.270
<v Speaker 2>cause you know how TV is like pretty women are like a decoration on TV,</v>

3043
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:42.291
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3044
01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:43.700
<v Speaker 2>They're always around.</v>

3045
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:45.650
<v Speaker 2>And whenever there's an event,</v>

3046
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 2>there's hot chicks there that nobody really knows how they got there.</v>

3047
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.061
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3048
01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3049
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who invited them or what.</v>

3050
01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.950
<v Speaker 2>They're just here but that,</v>

3051
01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.860
<v Speaker 2>but that's how it is.</v>

3052
01:18:54.861 --> 01:18:55.001
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3053
01:18:55.001 --> 01:18:56.450
<v Speaker 2>it's always like that.</v>

3054
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.030
<v Speaker 2>And she was never comfortable with that.</v>

3055
01:18:59.031 --> 01:18:59.571
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3056
01:18:59.571 --> 01:18:59.781
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3057
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:00.950
<v Speaker 2>if they're going to fuck anybody,</v>

3058
01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they're going to fuck a producer.</v>

3059
01:19:02.061 --> 01:19:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Like they know,</v>

3060
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 2>they know how this game works.</v>

3061
01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:08.540
<v Speaker 2>They know they only going to get so far fucking the winner of last comic</v>

3062
01:19:08.541 --> 01:19:11.510
<v Speaker 2>standing that that's not a career.</v>

3063
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 2>You might be a step though.</v>

3064
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 2>I might be a stepping stone.</v>

3065
01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>So at best to get you across the creek,</v>

3066
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I might be able to get you backstage where you could meet somebody,</v>

3067
01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:22.551
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3068
01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:22.881
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3069
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:23.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3070
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:23.841
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3071
01:19:23.841 --> 01:19:24.260
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

3072
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:24.771
<v Speaker 2>she never,</v>

3073
01:19:24.771 --> 01:19:25.490
<v Speaker 2>and she was hot,</v>

3074
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:25.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3075
01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>but she never couldn't handle it,</v>

3076
01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:27.831
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>

3077
01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get used to it.</v>

3078
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:29.391
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3079
01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3080
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>there's some of those things,</v>

3081
01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:34.430
<v Speaker 2>some of those events where they bring in girls and I knew girls that would get</v>

3082
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:35.264
<v Speaker 2>hired,</v>

3083
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:36.410
<v Speaker 2>they would literally get hired.</v>

3084
01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:40.580
<v Speaker 2>They'd get paid like 1000 bucks to go to these events and parties and mingle</v>

3085
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.500
<v Speaker 2>cause they want to just be,</v>

3086
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.531
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying,</v>

3087
01:19:42.531 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just filled with hot chicks but they're not like,</v>

3088
01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I used to always say they're not real.</v>

3089
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:49.760
<v Speaker 2>They're just here like not meaning they're not real.</v>

3090
01:19:49.761 --> 01:19:50.511
<v Speaker 2>They're real people.</v>

3091
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they have a life and stuff but in this atmosphere they're here to make</v>

3092
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 2>this room look good.</v>

3093
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.360
<v Speaker 2>They're here too.</v>

3094
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.193
<v Speaker 2>They're also here.</v>

3095
01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 2>They also here to find some sort of a producer that might be able to take care</v>

3096
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:01.220
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

3097

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.830
<v Speaker 2>they would find this to make it work.</v>

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3111
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:27.660

3113
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:31.171
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3114
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you can concentrate on other people's problems way too long and you get lost.</v>

3115
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.790
<v Speaker 2>You lose yourself.</v>

3116
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 2>It's cheese to eat that.</v>

3117
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing about social media.</v>

3118
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy to get caught up in nonsense that really shouldn't affect you at</v>

3119
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

3120
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3121
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:47.060
<v Speaker 2>And some people do more than like,</v>

3122
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.480
<v Speaker 2>like it's unreasonable.</v>

3123
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.781
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3124
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:49.081
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3125
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:52.530
<v Speaker 2>we can't save everyone from everything.</v>

3126
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Like in a perfect world we could,</v>

3127
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.220
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

3128
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:57.061
<v Speaker 2>the world's not perfect.</v>

3129
01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3130
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3131
01:20:57.650 --> 01:20:58.201
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3132
01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:01.690
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same way with Hollywood and show business like you,</v>

3133
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 2>you have to remember this shit ain't real.</v>

3134
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3135
01:21:05.071 --> 01:21:06.300
<v Speaker 2>it is on some level,</v>

3136
01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:10.320
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it is just glamorous and they treat you good and they love you.</v>

3137
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:10.950
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

3138
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3139
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3140
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I think what helped me was the fact that I worked in the real world before I got</v>

3141
01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:19.800
<v Speaker 2>into this because I remember my first job,</v>

3142
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I was a truck driver for the show power rangers for the kid show and I'd never</v>

3143
01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:27.330
<v Speaker 2>worked in TV and I didn't know anything about it.</v>

3144
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And we go and there's breakfast and then there's lunch and I'm like,</v>

3145
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.054
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

3146
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.511
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3147
01:21:34.511 --> 01:21:34.981
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3148
01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing,</v>

3149
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing someone complained and I wanted to say,</v>

3150
01:21:37.771 --> 01:21:38.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3151
01:21:38.071 --> 01:21:39.090
<v Speaker 2>in the real world,</v>

3152
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get your own food.</v>

3153
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:44.580
<v Speaker 2>They feed you every day.</v>

3154
01:21:44.581 --> 01:21:49.581
<v Speaker 2>You might want to show a little gratitude when you're on the power rangers.</v>

3155
01:21:49.591 --> 01:21:50.580
<v Speaker 2>You wish you were on friends.</v>

3156
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just how it is.</v>

3157
01:21:52.381 --> 01:21:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Everybody always wants better.</v>

3158
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:54.990
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever happy.</v>

3159
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:56.190
<v Speaker 2>There's always a bigger,</v>

3160
01:21:56.191 --> 01:21:57.570
<v Speaker 2>better deal around the corner.</v>

3161
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I had fun with that,</v>

3162
01:21:58.951 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 2>showed that that show was actually,</v>

3163
01:22:00.811 --> 01:22:03.180
<v Speaker 2>that's where I learned everything about TV.</v>

3164
01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I learned to whatever,</v>

3165
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:04.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3166
01:22:04.831 --> 01:22:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I learned what the best boy is and what the key grip.</v>

3167
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Like you see all those titles and you're like,</v>

3168
01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that?</v>

3169
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:13.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I learned who all those people are.</v>

3170
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:18.270
<v Speaker 2>I learned what upstage Matt while I was on a television show told me,</v>

3171
01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:19.640
<v Speaker 2>could you move upstage?</v>

3172
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:20.483
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3173
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:21.503
<v Speaker 2>which way is that?</v>

3174
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Which way's upstage?</v>

3175
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:24.330
<v Speaker 2>It's off.</v>

3176
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:25.163
<v Speaker 2>And you know they were,</v>

3177
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.250
<v Speaker 2>they were a bunch of people.</v>

3178
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez,</v>

3179
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:28.500
<v Speaker 2>fuck did he get here?</v>

3180
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.770
<v Speaker 2>And Comics Mad.</v>

3181
01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:30.871
<v Speaker 2>They were mad to,</v>

3182
01:22:30.871 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I worked with some actress.</v>

3183
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It really didn't like the fact that I had never really done any acting before.</v>

3184
01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.330
<v Speaker 2>And then it was easy.</v>

3185
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.171
<v Speaker 2>It's not that hard,</v>

3186
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:38.730
<v Speaker 2>but upstage the way it used to be.</v>

3187
01:22:38.731 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 2>And those Victorians,</v>

3188
01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Shakespearian stages,</v>

3189
01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:41.881
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

3190
01:22:41.881 --> 01:22:42.750
<v Speaker 2>a ramp,</v>

3191
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.910
<v Speaker 2>like the stage was not flat.</v>

3192
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:47.610
<v Speaker 2>It was like it was elevated in the back.</v>

3193
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And the idea being that you could see it through the entire complex as they move</v>

3194
01:22:52.031 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 2>to the back of the stage upstage.</v>

3195
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.840
<v Speaker 2>You could see in the back right there,</v>

3196
01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.800
<v Speaker 2>otherwise the ramp so everyone could see it.</v>

3197
01:22:58.830 --> 01:22:59.161
<v Speaker 2>Then they just,</v>

3198
01:22:59.161 --> 01:23:01.170
<v Speaker 2>they were flat figured out,</v>

3199
01:23:01.171 --> 01:23:01.351
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3200
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:01.861
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

3201
01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:03.840
<v Speaker 2>If we put the seats in a ramp,</v>

3202
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.690
<v Speaker 2>we can make the stage floods.</v>

3203
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:10.030
<v Speaker 2>One of those great moments in theater that nobody got credit for,</v>

3204
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:11.560
<v Speaker 2>that the guy who said,</v>

3205
01:23:11.561 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3206
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 2>how about if we put the seats up hill and we can keep the stage each flat.</v>

3207
01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.760
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to tell you my great Joe Rogan story cause I don't know if you</v>

3208
01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:25.930
<v Speaker 2>remember this story.</v>

3209
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I will always remember this story.</v>

3210
01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:28.901
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

3211
01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:29.531
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

3212
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3213
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:34.630
<v Speaker 2>this was a great that this is my second year at Montreal.</v>

3214
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I had gone once and I had done new faces and then um,</v>

3215
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3216
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:41.530
<v Speaker 2>just doing whatever.</v>

3217
01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It was great for me and that's when I became a comic fulltime,</v>

3218
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.701
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

3219
01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3220
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:51.300
<v Speaker 2>so I come back the next year and I bumped into you and I think you were either</v>

3221
01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 2>your still on news radio or you had just finished news radio or something like</v>

3222
01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:56.620

3223
01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 2>What year was it?</v>

3224
01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:00.340

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>He's probably on it still.</v>

3227
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it ended at nine nine and then Kevin James showed up and I think Kevin's</v>

3228
01:24:07.091 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 2>show was about to hit or it just hit or something like that.</v>

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And I rode around in a cab.</v>

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm hanging out with Joe Rogan and Kevin James.</v>

3237
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.400

<v Speaker 2>Nice fun</v>

3246
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.583
<v Speaker 4>comic.</v>

3247
01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.461
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

3248
01:24:47.461 --> 01:24:48.061
<v Speaker 4>I remember being,</v>

3249
01:24:48.061 --> 01:24:49.430
<v Speaker 4>I remember driving around with you,</v>

3250
01:24:49.431 --> 01:24:50.264
<v Speaker 4>but to me,</v>

3251
01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:53.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean I never wanted to be on TV,</v>

3252
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:53.491
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3253
01:24:53.491 --> 01:24:54.960
<v Speaker 4>So being on TV was just something like,</v>

3254
01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:55.321
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3255
01:24:55.321 --> 01:24:55.740
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3256
01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.400
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that.</v>

3257
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.210
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of money.</v>

3258
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:57.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3259
01:24:57.541 --> 01:24:57.811
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

3260
01:24:57.811 --> 01:24:58.644
<v Speaker 4>I'm on TV.</v>

3261
01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:03.660
<v Speaker 4>But any moment while I was on t stand up when I was on TV rather I was thinking</v>

3262
01:25:03.661 --> 01:25:06.300
<v Speaker 4>this is going to end and I'm gonna go right back to being a stand up.</v>

3263
01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I always thought of myself as a standup.</v>

3264
01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3265
01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I love being a standup.</v>

3266
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:11.660
<v Speaker 2>You know it's,</v>

3267
01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would love that everyone would love that hit TV thing.</v>

3268
01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3269
01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the lottery payoff,</v>

3270
01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:17.881
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3271
01:25:17.881 --> 01:25:19.290
<v Speaker 2>When you get one of those and you,</v>

3272
01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:20.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3273
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:21.000
<v Speaker 2>make a ton of money.</v>

3274
01:25:21.001 --> 01:25:24.720
<v Speaker 2>But there's nothing like being on stage and,</v>

3275
01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:25.190
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3276
01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:29.280
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing I've always loved is the respect of the good comics.</v>

3277
01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:31.860
<v Speaker 2>That's everything that's ever when,</v>

3278
01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.250
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

3279
01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:33.061
<v Speaker 2>when the good ones,</v>

3280
01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:33.900
<v Speaker 2>when the pros,</v>

3281
01:25:33.901 --> 01:25:34.660
<v Speaker 2>the masters,</v>

3282
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.550
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>

3283
01:25:35.551 --> 01:25:36.470
<v Speaker 2>when Hitler and,</v>

3284
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

3285
01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:37.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3286
01:25:37.381 --> 01:25:37.951
<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>

3287
01:25:37.951 --> 01:25:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Cause they just treat you like you're one of them.</v>

3288
01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.540
<v Speaker 2>You know that that was always the thing.</v>

3289
01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:43.590
<v Speaker 2>When they talk to you,</v>

3290
01:25:43.591 --> 01:25:44.520
<v Speaker 2>they treat you like you're like,</v>

3291
01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3292
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3293
01:25:45.271 --> 01:25:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3294
01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:46.101
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3295
01:25:46.101 --> 01:25:51.101
<v Speaker 4>I was in the parking lot of the comedy store in like 94 or something like that.</v>

3296
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:52.940
<v Speaker 4>And Damon Wayans,</v>

3297
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.050
<v Speaker 4>he had seen me on stage and he looked at me,</v>

3298
01:25:55.051 --> 01:25:55.580
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3299

<v Speaker 4>Funny motherfucker.</v>

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.920

01:26:00.921 --> 01:26:01.754
<v Speaker 4>that was funny.</v>

3303
01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 4>And I remember like my whole was tingling.</v>

3304
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:04.420
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3305
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3306
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Damon Wayans had that.</v>

3307
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Like to me that was like just the most,</v>

3308
01:26:09.561 --> 01:26:11.630
<v Speaker 3>like the most elevating thing that could've ever happened.</v>

3309
01:26:11.631 --> 01:26:11.871
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3310
01:26:11.871 --> 01:26:12.561
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

3311
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm legit now.</v>

3312
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Can you leave this?</v>

3313
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:17.420
<v Speaker 3>And then you become that guy crazy.</v>

3314
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:17.871
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3315
01:26:17.871 --> 01:26:19.520
<v Speaker 3>like in the past five years,</v>

3316
01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I've definitely become the old guy,</v>

3317
01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:22.280
<v Speaker 3>black guy.</v>

3318
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.900
<v Speaker 3>There's so many young comics.</v>

3319
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3320
01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:24.651
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

3321
01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I was watching you and oh man,</v>

3322
01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:27.321
<v Speaker 3>just talking to you.</v>

3323
01:26:27.321 --> 01:26:27.921
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning.</v>

3324
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:28.371
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3325
01:26:28.371 --> 01:26:28.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3326
01:26:28.431 --> 01:26:29.264
<v Speaker 3>I got you.</v>

3327
01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Cause I remember like George Wallace was my guy.</v>

3328
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to see George at the laugh factory and I talked to him and this or</v>

3329
01:26:35.811 --> 01:26:36.051
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3330
01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:37.700
<v Speaker 3>And he's still fucks with me about it.</v>

3331
01:26:37.701 --> 01:26:38.511
<v Speaker 3>Like we were in Vegas,</v>

3332
01:26:38.511 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 3>we were having lunch or something.</v>

3333
01:26:39.471 --> 01:26:39.681
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3334
01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:39.861
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3335
01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:40.400
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot.</v>

3336
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 3>So just sitting around waiting for me to die.</v>

3337
01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:43.310
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3338
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Damn Right George.</v>

3339
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:48.530
<v Speaker 3>I take over this whole Las Vegas operation.</v>

3340
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 3>He hated that operation man toward the end I talked more about it at the comedy</v>

3341
01:26:53.331 --> 01:26:53.931
<v Speaker 3>Magic Club.</v>

3342
01:26:53.931 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 3>He came back backstage and I was there and we were hanging out and talking and</v>

3343
01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 3>he said it.</v>

3344
01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:58.071
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3345
01:26:58.071 --> 01:26:59.000
<v Speaker 3>it is not easy.</v>

3346
01:26:59.060 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 3>He said it was hard.</v>

3347
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 3>You know why they for Wallet?</v>

3348
01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Because he had a pay for everything to promote it because he was going up again.</v>

3349
01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 3>He said the reason he stopped doing it because other clubs,</v>

3350
01:27:08.211 --> 01:27:09.500
<v Speaker 3>they were giving it away free,</v>

3351
01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 3>so he's four wall and then trying to sell tickets when they're giving away free</v>

3352
01:27:14.451 --> 01:27:19.451
<v Speaker 3>tickets to so and so show because they're backed by the casino and he said</v>

3353
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 3>that's why he said you just got to where you couldn't.</v>

3354
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:24.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't compete with free also.</v>

3355
01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you got to go on the road and you haven't really established yourself on</v>

3356
01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:32.780
<v Speaker 3>the road and decades because all this time he's been in Vegas doing this one</v>

3357
01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:33.614
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

3358
01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 3>just trying to pack this one place with people out of town.</v>

3359
01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.130
<v Speaker 3>So he's got the billboards,</v>

3360
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.991
<v Speaker 3>he's got the,</v>

3361
01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:38.191
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3362
01:27:38.191 --> 01:27:40.820
<v Speaker 3>the things on top of the cabs and all that shit and he's,</v>

3363
01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 3>he's got a good hustle.</v>

3364
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I'd keeping it together in Vegas,</v>

3365
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 3>but that shit doesn't mean anything when you go to Philly.</v>

3366
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3367
01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:48.320
<v Speaker 3>the people that haven't gone to Vegas,</v>

3368
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:49.160
<v Speaker 3>they're like George who?</v>

3369
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:50.030
<v Speaker 3>George Wallace.</v>

3370
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.311
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3371
01:27:50.311 --> 01:27:51.144
<v Speaker 3>I remember that guy.</v>

3372
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:52.063
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to come.</v>

3373
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:52.290
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

3374
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:52.690
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to cut.</v>

3375
01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:54.210
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what's better there.</v>

3376
01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Was he on comedy central last year?</v>

3377
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3378
01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 3>w when was the last time you had a special,</v>

3379
01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>that's always been my weakest thing.</v>

3380
01:27:59.281 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I never been great at marketing.</v>

3381
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:02.083
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

3382
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Marketing.</v>

3383
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Marketing's a tough Gig,</v>

3384
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:05.020
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

3385
01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.290
<v Speaker 3>he had a great run in Vegas,</v>

3386
01:28:07.291 --> 01:28:09.960
<v Speaker 3>so for a long time he had a great run there.</v>

3387
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:11.503
<v Speaker 3>I think nine.</v>

3388
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3389
01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.220
<v Speaker 3>I think nine years.</v>

3390
01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:16.940
<v Speaker 3>But I talked to another guy who had one of those shows and he told me,</v>

3391
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:17.211
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3392
01:28:17.211 --> 01:28:18.044
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3393
01:28:18.570 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 3>you said you'd see them taxis.</v>

3394
01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I get a bill for that.</v>

3395
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Like every month,</v>

3396
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:23.960
<v Speaker 3>like the casino gives me a bill.</v>

3397
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:25.183
<v Speaker 3>The Casino?</v>

3398
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:25.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3399
01:28:25.841 --> 01:28:30.841
<v Speaker 3>Cause the casino puts up the money to put your picture on top of a hundred taxi</v>

3400
01:28:30.951 --> 01:28:31.784
<v Speaker 3>cabs,</v>

3401
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:32.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3402
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:36.950
<v Speaker 3>and then at the end of the month you get a bill for that or they take it out of</v>

3403
01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 3>what you've made in the box office.</v>

3404
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3405
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.821
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

3407
01:28:40.821 --> 01:28:41.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3408
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:41.850
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough,</v>

3409
01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:42.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3410
01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:43.040
<v Speaker 3>unless you're,</v>

3411
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:45.680
<v Speaker 3>unless you're a big name,</v>

3412
01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3413
01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:48.770
<v Speaker 3>unless you're one of those big Vegas shows going in,</v>

3414
01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.500
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be like Hosni spears or something like that.</v>

3415
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Like I never hear about a comic having a big name.</v>

3416
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess carrot top he does well,</v>

3417
01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.150
<v Speaker 3>he's more of a variety show.</v>

3418
01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a comic for sure,</v>

3419
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:05.190
<v Speaker 3>but he's more of a variety show because he's got the props and he's been in</v>

3420
01:29:05.191 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Vegas long enough.</v>

3421
01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Like he's built,</v>

3422
01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 3>he's built a show there.</v>

3423
01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.081
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3424
01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Like people know him.</v>

3425
01:29:11.311 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like Siegfried and Roy type thing.</v>

3426
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Like carrot top is a Vegas show.</v>

3427
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3428
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:17.370

3429
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 3>how long has he been in there?</v>

3430
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

3431
01:29:19.411 --> 01:29:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Probably like 10 years.</v>

3432
01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.840
<v Speaker 3>He's been there longer than George.</v>

3433
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:24.300
<v Speaker 3>So does no one else though.</v>

3434
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.840

3435
01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.673

3449
01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like weeknights.</v>

3450
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:45.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing.</v>

3451
01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Monday or Tuesday,</v>

3452
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Monday and Tuesday night or something like that.</v>

3453
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3454
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered what that would be like.</v>

3455
01:29:51.031 --> 01:29:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Like there was one time we were negotiating to do a,</v>

3456
01:29:53.761 --> 01:29:54.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3457
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.250
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to do a reality stars thing in Vegas so they'd have like,</v>

3458
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.000
<v Speaker 3>like I was going to host it because I won last comic standing and then they were</v>

3459
01:30:03.001 --> 01:30:05.190
<v Speaker 3>going to have like the winner of the country singing.</v>

3460
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Like they couldn't get the big,</v>

3461
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3462
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 3>the American idol winners and stuff like that,</v>

3463
01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:14.241
<v Speaker 3>but it was all the second tier reality shows like the winter to country music</v>

3464
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:19.620
<v Speaker 3>singing show and the winter of this that there's some show on country music</v>

3465
01:30:19.621 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 3>tells me like American idol,</v>

3466
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.460
<v Speaker 3>but for country singers and Ma,</v>

3467
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I probably get to 20 million people to watch it and they wanted all of us to do</v>

3468
01:30:26.251 --> 01:30:31.080
<v Speaker 3>a show and I had hoped it went because I wanted to see what it would be like to</v>

3469
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:35.430
<v Speaker 3>just be on a Vegas show for like to live in Vegas and work in Vegas for six</v>

3470
01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:35.880
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

3471
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You had a,</v>

3472
01:30:36.850 --> 01:30:38.070
<v Speaker 3>you could go crazy things,</v>

3473
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:42.210
<v Speaker 3>so I think you'd go crazy and I think your world would get very weird.</v>

3474
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I think your world gets weird if you live there.</v>

3475
01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:48.660
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something strange about being in the city that is a,</v>

3476
01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I love Vegas,</v>

3477
01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I love working there.</v>

3478
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I love doing the UFC there,</v>

3479
01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:54.360
<v Speaker 3>but I love getting the fuck out of there.</v>

3480
01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:58.410
<v Speaker 3>Just as much as I love getting in there a week is pretty much as much Vegas as</v>

3481
01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.000
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

3482
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Never even do a week.</v>

3483
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I do two days,</v>

3484

3487
01:31:08.271 --> 01:31:08.520

3496
01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:17.101
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting out of here.</v>

3497

<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking something new and flight or 1:00 PM flight in.</v>

3498
01:31:19.571 --> 01:31:21.990
<v Speaker 3>The last thing you want to do is try to drive.</v>

3499
01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He tried out on the weekend.</v>

3501
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to drive that a Vegas,</v>

3502
01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:30.231
<v Speaker 3>you better leave at Saturday night at 5:00 AM you got to do it because otherwise</v>

3503
01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take forever.</v>

3504
01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:32.461
<v Speaker 3>I know people,</v>

3505
01:31:32.461 --> 01:31:32.971
<v Speaker 3>let's take eight,</v>

3506
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 3>nine hours when I go,</v>

3507
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.700
<v Speaker 3>when I do a club,</v>

3508
01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:37.083

3511
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Like I like,</v>

3512

<v Speaker 3>I'll go to a gym somewhere off the strip and I'll go eat somewhere off the strip</v>

3513
01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:48.300
<v Speaker 3>and then you're there at night and that's okay.</v>

3514
01:31:48.301 --> 01:31:48.590

3517
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:54.030
<v Speaker 3>like the idea of just being in that casino,</v>

3558
01:32:50.681 --> 01:32:51.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3559
01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:52.163
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:53.223
<v Speaker 2>And he loves it.</v>

3561
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>15 years.</v>

3564
01:32:58.150 --> 01:32:58.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3565
01:32:58.331 --> 01:33:00.910
<v Speaker 2>if you had to choose to Chine living in Vegas and living in Toledo,</v>

3566
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the fucking Vegas every God Damn Day of the week.</v>

3567
01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.260
<v Speaker 2>No offense to Lido,</v>

3568
01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 2>but you know what the fuck I'm saying.</v>

3569
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something weird though about living in a city that is the place</v>

3570
01:33:11.741 --> 01:33:13.210
<v Speaker 2>that people go to get crazy.</v>

3571
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:13.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3572
01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:15.000
<v Speaker 2>well you have to get away.</v>

3573
01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:15.923
<v Speaker 2>That's why you can't,</v>

3574
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone who lives there who goes to the strip on a regular basis.</v>

3575
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3576
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Anyone I know who lives in Vegas,</v>

3577
01:33:23.051 --> 01:33:23.530
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3578
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3579
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:24.191
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>

3580
01:33:24.191 --> 01:33:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally there's a show they'll go to or they'll take their friends,</v>

3581
01:33:28.271 --> 01:33:29.590
<v Speaker 2>their when their friends visit,</v>

3582
01:33:29.591 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise they just don't go to the strip.</v>

3583
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been to that bar on the top of Vegas?</v>

3584
01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:36.090
<v Speaker 2>The top of a,</v>

3585
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the men as it Mandalay Bay,</v>

3586
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Mandalay bay.</v>

3587
01:33:39.611 --> 01:33:44.611
<v Speaker 2>The bar at the top or it looks out over like it's like the most or something</v>

3588
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:45.401
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like the hotels were empty and all loads.</v>

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.720
<v Speaker 3>all the people that were dependent upon folks hopping around town and also</v>

01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:32.480
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem with all due respect to Indianapolis.</v>

3734
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:33.703
<v Speaker 3>It's not happening,</v>

3735
01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:35.450
<v Speaker 3>but I'll do respect Alonzo stay in the know.</v>

3736
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 3>But you gotta think like,</v>

3737
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:41.180
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about with Tammy Passkey telly as a touring comic,</v>

3738
01:37:41.181 --> 01:37:42.014
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

3739
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:43.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3740
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>your home becomes just a base and you travel out of it if you have somewhere</v>

3741
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.291
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

3742
01:37:48.291 --> 01:37:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I remember Schimmel telling me,</v>

3743
01:37:49.581 --> 01:37:52.370
<v Speaker 3>cause Schimmel moved to Scottsdale and he said,</v>

3744
01:37:52.371 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3745
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I got a beautiful house.</v>

3746
01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:54.560
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3747
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.620
<v Speaker 3>I got a airport.</v>

3748
01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:55.981
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3749
01:37:55.981 --> 01:37:56.814
<v Speaker 3>that's all you need.</v>

3750
01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:57.421
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3751
01:37:57.421 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 3>if you're a road comic,</v>

3752
01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.820
<v Speaker 3>if you got a good airport,</v>

3753
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:01.800
<v Speaker 3>you can live anywhere you want.</v>

3754
01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 3>It is all you need.</v>

3755
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 3>But when you leave la or New York,</v>

3756
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:11.030
<v Speaker 3>you give up the weekday spots and you give up the auditions and it isn't like</v>

3757
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:11.941
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3758
01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:15.510
<v Speaker 3>there is an aspect of the business you give up when you leave.</v>

3759
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.580
<v Speaker 3>New York and La do weekday spots are big.</v>

3760
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.250
<v Speaker 3>The weekday spots and also being around great comics,</v>

3761
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3762
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3766
01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:28.890
<v Speaker 3>like a vagabond.</v>

3767
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3768

<v Speaker 3>I think for like five years,</v>

3771
01:38:34.201 --> 01:38:34.831
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't had a,</v>

01:38:51.661 --> 01:38:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Like all these people were there that were really high level.</v>

3785
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.580
<v Speaker 3>It was just a great night of,</v>

01:38:56.821 --> 01:38:57.590
<v Speaker 3>of comedy.</v>

3788
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.691
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3803
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Even last week,</v>

3826
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.620
<v Speaker 3>That's important for comics to ha.</v>

3838
01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:07.260
<v Speaker 3>like I like working some of those alternative rooms and some of those youngster</v>

3839
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:09.930
<v Speaker 3>rooms just to be around something different.</v>

3840
01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Like not the bullshit side,</v>

3841
01:40:11.791 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 3>but the ones who are real comics,</v>

01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:14.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're coming up and they're there.</v>

3843
01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 3>They're just funny,</v>

3844
01:40:16.021 --> 01:40:17.490
<v Speaker 3>but they're doing it in a different way.</v>

3845
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I like being around that.</v>

3848
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:20.221
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3849
01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:23.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a group that are coming up now that grew up with the Internet.</v>

3850
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3851
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.320
<v Speaker 3>This is the first,</v>

3852
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:28.320
<v Speaker 3>the first generation of standup Comedians,</v>

3853
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:30.210
<v Speaker 3>these guys that are in their early twenties,</v>

3854
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you got to think 1994,</v>

3855
01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 3>20 fucking one years ago.</v>

3856
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Speaker 3>That's when the Internet came around.</v>

3857
01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3858
01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:40.310
<v Speaker 3>They all grew up with the inner when they were five and six years old.</v>

3859
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Technology is normal to them.</v>

3860
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Totally normal and a part of life.</v>

3861
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:46.560
<v Speaker 3>So we started talking about looking at encyclopedias.</v>

3862
01:40:47.150 --> 01:40:49.380
<v Speaker 3>You break out the scrolls of the elders.</v>

3863
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:51.390
<v Speaker 3>They should go to the,</v>

3864
01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.860
<v Speaker 3>the sacred cabin in the,</v>

3865
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 3>where they kept the scrolls.</v>

3866
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:55.270
<v Speaker 3>And then the other side,</v>

3867
01:40:55.271 --> 01:40:58.840
<v Speaker 3>when you see older comics who don't change their act,</v>

3868
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3869
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:02.200
<v Speaker 3>said they'll make like a videotape reference and you're like,</v>

3870
01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:03.363
<v Speaker 3>videotape.</v>

3871
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:05.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst,</v>

3872
01:41:05.441 --> 01:41:05.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3873
01:41:05.741 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to set the clock on your set the clock.</v>

3874
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:14.940
<v Speaker 3>What you heard someone getting a joke like that recently in the past three years</v>

3875
01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>

3876
01:41:15.650 --> 01:41:17.860
<v Speaker 3>haven't heard set the clock on the VCR.</v>

3877
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing sadder than a lot of these,</v>

3878
01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:20.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3879
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 3>these guys that just don't write anymore.</v>

3880
01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:23.680
<v Speaker 3>There's something about like,</v>

3881
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:25.180
<v Speaker 3>musicians can pull that off.</v>

3882
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Like musicians from the 1960s can do the same songs.</v>

3883
01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:29.440
<v Speaker 3>If you went to see,</v>

3884
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:30.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3885
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:30.964
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank,</v>

3886
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 3>you know whatever band and they were doing some shit from the 1960s you be like,</v>

3887
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

3888
01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:36.424
<v Speaker 3>that's a great song.</v>

3889
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:40.360
<v Speaker 3>But if you went to see a comic and they were doing jokes in the 1960s she'd be</v>

3890
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:40.541
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3891
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:43.180
<v Speaker 3>what kind of sadness am I looking at?</v>

3892
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.991
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

3893
01:41:43.991 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I do these jazz cruises and I love it because I get to work with some of the</v>

3894
01:41:47.021 --> 01:41:50.860
<v Speaker 3>greatest jazz musicians in the world and they're brilliant.</v>

3895
01:41:50.861 --> 01:41:51.370
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

3896
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I bring that up and they love when I fuck with him about it cause I'm like,</v>

3897
01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:55.180
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3898
01:41:55.180 --> 01:42:00.180
<v Speaker 3>I got to do a show Monday and then I do another show Friday and I got to do two</v>

3899
01:42:00.191 --> 01:42:01.030
<v Speaker 3>different shows.</v>

3900
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.680
<v Speaker 3>You are playing some shit.</v>

3901
01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:07.681
<v Speaker 3>Miles Davis wrote in 1947 and they think you're a fucking genius.</v>

3902
01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 3>You were playing some shit to dizzy Gillespie played after the war.</v>

3903
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 3>That would be world war two and they think you're brilliant so and that,</v>

3904
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.431
<v Speaker 3>but I fuck with them.</v>

3905
01:42:18.431 --> 01:42:22.180
<v Speaker 3>They love it though because it is true when you're a musician and if you have a</v>

3906
01:42:22.181 --> 01:42:23.140
<v Speaker 3>hit song,</v>

3907
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.180
<v Speaker 3>you have to play that song,</v>

3908
01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:25.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3909
01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:28.120
<v Speaker 3>no matter how old it is or whatever it is,</v>

3910
01:42:28.121 --> 01:42:28.954
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

3911
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that song.</v>

3912
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:33.220
<v Speaker 3>And like if I do a joke like uh,</v>

3913
01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:36.820
<v Speaker 3>we heard that one and I could never be like,</v>

3914
01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:37.943
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3915
01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:42.960
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of Eddie Murphy and delirious 1983 I like to do gunny Gugu</v>

3916
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:46.720
<v Speaker 3>there's no cover comics.</v>

3917
01:42:46.721 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 3>They used to be,</v>

3918
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:49.180
<v Speaker 3>do you remember Ilan Gold?</v>

3919
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3920
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 3>He used to do impressions of Comedians and doing it with their own material,</v>

3921
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 3>but then people started getting mad at him cause his impressions were dead on.</v>

3922
01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.680
<v Speaker 3>He did amazing impressions,</v>

3923
01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.690
<v Speaker 3>but he would do it with their material.</v>

3924
01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

3925
01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.520
<v Speaker 3>but that's funny cause you're doing it right.</v>

3926
01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:07.480
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing it as if you came up with it yourself.</v>

3927
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3928
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:08.171
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3929
01:43:08.171 --> 01:43:08.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3930
01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but he still had to stop doing it.</v>

3931
01:43:10.811 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3932
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.640
<v Speaker 3>He got in trouble a little bit.</v>

3933
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:13.503
<v Speaker 3>People got mad at him.</v>

3934
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:14.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who got mad at them,</v>

3935
01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:15.640
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I had heard.</v>

3936
01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 3>So then he started doing impressions of these comics with material that he</v>

3937
01:43:18.971 --> 01:43:19.570
<v Speaker 3>wrote.</v>

3938
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:24.570
<v Speaker 3>I heard some guy did an hour of Patrice and put it on youtube as if it was his</v>

3939
01:43:25.181 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>

3940
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:26.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3941
01:43:26.011 --> 01:43:30.190
<v Speaker 3>he had done a bunch of other stuff about that Patrice had done in the past and</v>

3942
01:43:30.191 --> 01:43:31.120
<v Speaker 3>not acknowledged it.</v>

3943
01:43:31.121 --> 01:43:32.220
<v Speaker 3>And he tried to pretend that it was a,</v>

3944
01:43:32.221 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 3>obviously just an homage to Patrice,</v>

3945
01:43:35.201 --> 01:43:38.440
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't the plagiarist.</v>

3946
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:39.260
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3947
01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:40.150
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>

3948
01:43:41.290 --> 01:43:42.123
<v Speaker 3>People are insane.</v>

3949
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3950
01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.200
<v Speaker 3>People think they can get away with shit.</v>

3951
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:47.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of nutty people out there that think that they're going to sneak</v>

3952
01:43:47.711 --> 01:43:48.544
<v Speaker 3>by.</v>

3953
01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:49.211
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3954
01:43:49.211 --> 01:43:51.130
<v Speaker 3>some of them do because the audience doesn't,</v>

3955
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:52.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3956
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.971
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>

3957
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but the audience doesn't.</v>

3958
01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

3959
01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.800
<v Speaker 2>So you fully audience,</v>

3960
01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 4>there's some guys to this day that it's knocked by.</v>

3961
01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:02.840
<v Speaker 4>You tell people that guy he got famous by being a plagiarist.</v>

3962
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:03.201
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3963
01:44:03.201 --> 01:44:04.034
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3964
01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:04.791
<v Speaker 4>And then you go,</v>

3965
01:44:04.791 --> 01:44:05.031
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3966
01:44:05.031 --> 01:44:05.864
<v Speaker 4>go Google it.</v>

3967
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 4>And you'll tell them like they'll go Google it and like what?</v>

3968
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3969
01:44:09.561 --> 01:44:10.394
<v Speaker 4>but they don't care.</v>

3970
01:44:10.810 --> 01:44:11.570
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3971
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:12.450
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

3972
01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:12.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3973
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:13.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3974
01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you can always tell them,</v>

3975
01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3976
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3977
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if the artists cares,</v>

3978
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 2>like if a comic or the whoever,</v>

3979
01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3980
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause you said you know it when you're,</v>

3981
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:25.760
<v Speaker 2>you know when you can bullshit the crowd and you can make,</v>

3982
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you could make millions of dollars but then you're in the room or you're on the</v>

3983
01:44:30.111 --> 01:44:33.560
<v Speaker 2>show with the real comics and you know,</v>

3984
01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:34.910
<v Speaker 2>just same thing with singers,</v>

3985
01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:35.451
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3986
01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:35.781
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

3987
01:44:35.781 --> 01:44:38.690
<v Speaker 2>if you're one of these singers where the machine is doing it,</v>

3988
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:41.180
<v Speaker 2>but now you're in a situation like,</v>

3989
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:41.721
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

3990
01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 2>like award show these.</v>

3991
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3992
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.420
<v Speaker 2>these are like,</v>

3993
01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.960
<v Speaker 2>like you call yourself a diva but Aretha Franklins in the room and you're like,</v>

3994
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:51.290
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

3995
01:44:51.291 --> 01:44:51.561
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3996
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:52.160
<v Speaker 2>this isn't it</v>

3997
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.160
<v Speaker 4>going to go it because like you were what you were saying like that the respect</v>

3998
01:44:57.981 --> 01:44:59.690
<v Speaker 4>of the old guard,</v>

3999
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.940
<v Speaker 4>like the respect of respected comedians like come,</v>

4000
01:45:01.941 --> 01:45:02.780
<v Speaker 4>coming up to like,</v>

4001
01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:04.093
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4002
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:04.881
<v Speaker 4>we've all had that.</v>

4003
01:45:04.881 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 4>Like I tell them that the Damon Waynes while I'll never,</v>

4004
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:09.850
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget that because it's in the parking lot.</v>

4005
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.161
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4006
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:10.670
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

4007
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:12.230
<v Speaker 4>He probably doesn't even remember right now.</v>

4008
01:45:12.231 --> 01:45:13.460
<v Speaker 4>But just being,</v>

4009
01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.740
<v Speaker 4>becoming friends with Robert Schimmel and I'm like,</v>

4010
01:45:15.741 --> 01:45:17.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm really friends with Robert Showman.</v>

4011
01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Like he's real,</v>

4012
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:20.810
<v Speaker 4>he's a real comic and I'm friends with them.</v>

4013
01:45:20.811 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I guess I'm a comic now.</v>

4014
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm a,</v>

4015
01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I can be a comedian.</v>

4016
01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.020
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't seem like now we both,</v>

4017
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:29.270
<v Speaker 4>we've been around so long it's just normal,</v>

4018
01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.240
<v Speaker 4>but damn the beginning is so fucking shaky.</v>

4019
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4020
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:37.700
<v Speaker 4>I think they'll always be some moments with some comics where you're like,</v>

4021
01:45:37.701 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

4022
01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:38.601
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4023
01:45:38.601 --> 01:45:42.560
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure cool that I notice I'm friends with this guy or whatever.</v>

4024
01:45:43.150 --> 01:45:45.020
<v Speaker 4>So those guys don't have that.</v>

4025
01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Those guys know that we know that they're full of shit.</v>

4026
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4027
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:48.251
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

4028
01:45:48.251 --> 01:45:48.490
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4029
01:45:48.490 --> 01:45:49.550
<v Speaker 4>that eats away at them.</v>

4030
01:45:49.630 --> 01:45:50.331
<v Speaker 4>I then always ate it,</v>

4031
01:45:50.331 --> 01:45:51.290
<v Speaker 4>ate away at him and see Ya.</v>

4032
01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:54.320
<v Speaker 4>That was on him and see his biggest thing so that no comics liked him.</v>

4033
01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:55.740
<v Speaker 4>His biggest things,</v>

4034
01:45:55.741 --> 01:45:58.670
<v Speaker 4>you can never got anybody's respect and you see chew away at him.</v>

4035
01:45:59.260 --> 01:45:59.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4036
01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:00.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

4037
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough,</v>

4038
01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough place.</v>

4039
01:46:01.671 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing that's funny is when they take an actor and they call</v>

4040
01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:05.984
<v Speaker 4>him a comic.</v>

4041
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:07.783
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4042
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:09.380
<v Speaker 4>Michael Richards.</v>

4043
01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:09.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4044
01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.191
<v Speaker 4>that's what I've heard,</v>

4045
01:46:10.191 --> 01:46:10.491
<v Speaker 4>Richard.</v>

4046
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:12.780
<v Speaker 4>It was like you're not a calm,</v>

4047
01:46:12.781 --> 01:46:12.921
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4048
01:46:12.921 --> 01:46:14.090
<v Speaker 4>you know what happened with Michael Richards?</v>

4049
01:46:14.091 --> 01:46:15.440
<v Speaker 4>The same shit that got you arrested.</v>

4050
01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Michael Richards came to the comedy store before he went to the laugh factory</v>

4051
01:46:21.201 --> 01:46:25.670
<v Speaker 4>coked out of his mind and he was just a real aggressive and talking crazy shit</v>

4052
01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:29.900
<v Speaker 4>and just wasn't just a Zahn of it is just out of it.</v>

4053
01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:34.030
<v Speaker 4>But I've watched him go up at the comedy store and uh,</v>

4054
01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:35.390
<v Speaker 4>my initial thought was like,</v>

4055
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.051
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

4056
01:46:36.051 --> 01:46:37.640
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know Michael Richards does stand up.</v>

4057
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:41.000
<v Speaker 4>And he would go onstage and the audience went nuts.</v>

4058
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:44.180
<v Speaker 4>But then three minutes in they were like,</v>

4059
01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.130
<v Speaker 4>when does this guy started telling jokes</v>

4060
01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:47.980
<v Speaker 2>what he do?</v>

4061
01:46:47.981 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd watch him and it'd done.</v>

4062
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Then he would just</v>

4063
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 3>do a Seinfeld move,</v>

4064
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:53.870
<v Speaker 3>like the head shake law,</v>

4065
01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:55.380
<v Speaker 3>something like that from Seinfeld.</v>

4066
01:46:55.381 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 3>And the crowd would love it for a little bit.</v>

4067
01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

4068
01:46:58.530 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4069
01:46:59.160 --> 01:46:59.721
<v Speaker 3>Well you got it.</v>

4070
01:46:59.721 --> 01:47:00.554
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4071
01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:01.251
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

4072
01:47:01.251 --> 01:47:02.760
<v Speaker 3>But that's the beauty of standup,</v>

4073
01:47:02.761 --> 01:47:03.630
<v Speaker 3>no matter who you are.</v>

4074
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:03.841
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4075
01:47:03.841 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Even Seinfeld said that like,</v>

4076
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 3>no matter who you are,</v>

4077
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be funny.</v>

4078
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like being Jerry Seinfeld got me the first five minutes and then</v>

4079
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

4080
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.681
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

4081
01:47:13.681 --> 01:47:14.514
<v Speaker 3>what else you got?</v>

4082
01:47:15.490 --> 01:47:15.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4083
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:17.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fucking shows an hour long and dude,</v>

4084
01:47:17.761 --> 01:47:18.920
<v Speaker 3>you better come with some funding.</v>

4085
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:21.420
<v Speaker 3>What do you this Cosby thing,</v>

4086
01:47:21.421 --> 01:47:21.631
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4087
01:47:21.631 --> 01:47:21.830
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

4088
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:22.860
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about that,</v>

4089
01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.040
<v Speaker 3>about how this guy for the longest time was thought of as like one of the all</v>

4090
01:47:30.001 --> 01:47:33.540
<v Speaker 3>time greats and now people look at him and they think,</v>

4091
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4092
01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy that's just,</v>

4093
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:37.080
<v Speaker 3>he's just a piece of shit like that,</v>

4094
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.340
<v Speaker 3>that flip flop between being like this respected,</v>

4095
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:42.300
<v Speaker 3>adored,</v>

4096
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.520
<v Speaker 3>idolized all time.</v>

4097
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.211
<v Speaker 3>Great Comedians.</v>

4098
01:47:45.211 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Like if you had to pick a Mt.</v>

4099
01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Rushmore standup comedy and there's only four guys on there,</v>

4100
01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:51.720
<v Speaker 3>one of those fucking guys until the last year.</v>

4101
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.110
<v Speaker 3>One of those guys is going to be bill Cosby it,</v>

4102
01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4103
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm so torn because I love Cosby.</v>

4104
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I think Cosby's one of the greatest,</v>

4105
01:47:58.710 --> 01:48:01.890
<v Speaker 3>if not the greatest of all time definitely would be on the Mount Rushmore.</v>

4106
01:48:02.130 --> 01:48:02.941
<v Speaker 3>So now it's like,</v>

4107
01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:03.610
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4108
01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:04.830
<v Speaker 3>still a great comic,</v>

4109
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:06.330
<v Speaker 3>but bad guy,</v>

4110
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4111
01:48:07.191 --> 01:48:10.800
<v Speaker 3>at at best flawed human being.</v>

4112
01:48:10.801 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 3>But I don't understand.</v>

4113
01:48:12.781 --> 01:48:16.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll never understand the motive it head to beat and it's just my opinion.</v>

4114
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.040
<v Speaker 3>There had to be some weird fetish involved because it's not like you can't get</v>

4115
01:48:22.621 --> 01:48:24.210
<v Speaker 3>laid if you're a bill Cosby.</v>

4116
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:29.750
<v Speaker 3>I think he quoted there had to be some kind of weird turn on or something.</v>

4117
01:48:31.251 --> 01:48:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4118
01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:32.251
<v Speaker 3>like I'd be,</v>

4119
01:48:32.251 --> 01:48:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I'd be interested in what a psychologist would say.</v>

4120
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Like why does someone do this?</v>

4121
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:40.620
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people used to do it.</v>

4122
01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think can think so.</v>

4123
01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 3>I think in the 1960s dosing people wasn't I,</v>

4124
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:49.020
<v Speaker 3>you know how we were talking about drunk driving in the early days,</v>

4125
01:48:49.021 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 3>drunk drivers,</v>

4126
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:50.423
<v Speaker 3>no big deal.</v>

4127
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:53.130
<v Speaker 3>I think they used to think the same way about dosing people.</v>

4128
01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:53.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4129
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 3>cause bill Cosby used to have a whole bit about Spanish fly.</v>

4130
01:48:57.090 --> 01:48:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4131
01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 3>About giving girls true.</v>

4132
01:48:58.810 --> 01:48:59.551
<v Speaker 3>Slipping a girl.</v>

4133
01:48:59.551 --> 01:49:02.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mickey and she gets all Horny and fucked up.</v>

4134
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's true.</v>

4135
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:05.190
<v Speaker 3>You're drugging someone against their will.</v>

4136
01:49:05.191 --> 01:49:06.024
<v Speaker 3>They don't know it.</v>

4137
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a normal thing,</v>

4138
01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:09.251
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

4139
01:49:09.251 --> 01:49:09.750
<v Speaker 3>And not,</v>

4140
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:10.920
<v Speaker 3>it was never a good thing.</v>

4141
01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:11.670
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4142
01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:12.091
<v Speaker 3>ethical,</v>

4143
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:12.924
<v Speaker 3>moral,</v>

4144
01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.440
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4145
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Reasonable people never did it.</v>

4146
01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:19.140
<v Speaker 3>But I think it was way more common than we would like to believe.</v>

4147
01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4148
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I may be people dosed people.</v>

4149
01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like,</v>

4150
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:26.820
<v Speaker 3>you remember that scene in animal house with the girl's passed out,</v>

4151
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:28.570
<v Speaker 3>the dude's got the devil on one shoulder and the angel,</v>

4152
01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:29.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4153
01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.260
<v Speaker 3>you lay leave her alone.</v>

4154
01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:31.651
<v Speaker 3>Fuck her.</v>

4155
01:49:31.651 --> 01:49:32.484
<v Speaker 3>Fuck her brains out.</v>

4156
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:33.323
<v Speaker 3>Tucker tests.</v>

4157
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Like you couldn't even do that today.</v>

4158
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:37.410
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't have that in the movie cause that's rape.</v>

4159
01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.300
<v Speaker 3>But back then it was like there was at least the possibility that this guy was</v>

4160
01:49:42.301 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 3>considering having sex with this passed out woman.</v>

4161
01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 3>And then today the drug thing,</v>

4162
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

4163
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.000
<v Speaker 4>the Cosby thing,</v>

4164
01:49:49.001 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 4>drugging someone is thought of as a heinous crime.</v>

4165
01:49:51.341 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Like you drug people and you raped him.</v>

4166
01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a heinous crime.</v>

4167
01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Well and,</v>

4168
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:56.480
<v Speaker 2>and it was then,</v>

4169
01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:57.351
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4170
01:49:57.351 --> 01:50:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you maybe society looked on it differently or maybe it was something amongst the</v>

4171
01:50:00.651 --> 01:50:01.484
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>

4172
01:50:01.570 --> 01:50:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4173
01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:02.900
<v Speaker 2>That you did.</v>

4174
01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:03.211
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4175
01:50:03.211 --> 01:50:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4176
01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know.</v>

4177
01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Playboy mansion and it,</v>

4178
01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:06.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4179
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:07.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4180
01:50:07.221 --> 01:50:07.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4181
01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.770
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible for everyone involved.</v>

4182
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:10.521
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4183
01:50:10.521 --> 01:50:12.380
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible for the women involved.</v>

4184
01:50:12.381 --> 01:50:17.381
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible for what's happened to his lifelong reputation is all gone now.</v>

4185
01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:20.270
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>

4186
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:21.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost,</v>

4187
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:23.330
<v Speaker 2>it was like with Michael Jackson,</v>

4188
01:50:23.331 --> 01:50:28.331
<v Speaker 2>like there's a generation that only thought of him as a freak and it's like,</v>

4189
01:50:28.821 --> 01:50:33.821
<v Speaker 2>you guys really don't understand who he was musically to the seventies and</v>

4190
01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:34.730
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

4191
01:50:34.730 --> 01:50:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause in the 90s,</v>

4192
01:50:35.751 --> 01:50:37.160
<v Speaker 2>he just became a freak show.</v>

4193
01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:38.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4194
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:39.060
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>

4195
01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.070
<v Speaker 4>there was a radio station in,</v>

4196
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:41.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4197
01:50:41.730 --> 01:50:43.950
<v Speaker 4>in La or in a Boston rather.</v>

4198
01:50:44.190 --> 01:50:49.020
<v Speaker 4>It was a called the rock of Boston w I think it was called [inaudible].</v>

4199
01:50:49.050 --> 01:50:49.883
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what it was.</v>

4200
01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:55.460
<v Speaker 4>And they played Michael Jackson when Michael Jackson came out and that,</v>

4201
01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:56.730
<v Speaker 4>I remember the DJ saying,</v>

4202
01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.390
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4203
01:50:57.390 --> 01:50:59.970
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying that this is dance music,</v>

4204
01:50:59.971 --> 01:51:00.804
<v Speaker 4>but listen,</v>

4205
01:51:00.930 --> 01:51:02.970
<v Speaker 4>this is just a great song.</v>

4206
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:03.930
<v Speaker 4>And the guy who played,</v>

4207
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:04.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4208
01:51:04.650 --> 01:51:05.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a,</v>

4209
01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:07.710
<v Speaker 4>trying to remember what song it was.</v>

4210
01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.240
<v Speaker 4>It might've been beat it.</v>

4211
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:10.081
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was,</v>

4212
01:51:10.081 --> 01:51:11.430
<v Speaker 4>but it was like that,</v>

4213
01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:12.990
<v Speaker 4>like d thriller,</v>

4214
01:51:12.991 --> 01:51:14.100
<v Speaker 4>when thriller came out,</v>

4215
01:51:14.130 --> 01:51:16.740
<v Speaker 4>everybody just stepped back and just said,</v>

4216
01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:17.850
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck.</v>

4217
01:51:17.851 --> 01:51:22.770
<v Speaker 4>This is just genius on a level that no one had been able to reach before.</v>

4218
01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:23.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4219
01:51:23.151 --> 01:51:23.391
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4220
01:51:23.391 --> 01:51:23.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4221
01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I did this award thing and they were given an award to Quincy Jones,</v>

4222
01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:27.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4223
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:31.100
<v Speaker 2>and he produced thriller and I was joking with him about,</v>

4224
01:51:31.101 --> 01:51:31.371
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

4225
01:51:31.371 --> 01:51:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4226
01:51:32.150 --> 01:51:32.821
<v Speaker 2>Quincy Jones,</v>

4227
01:51:32.821 --> 01:51:35.240
<v Speaker 2>dear brothers didn't know who Eddie van Halen was.</v>

4228
01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Van Halen doing or a Michael Jackson record them.</v>

4229
01:51:38.381 --> 01:51:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Like only Quincy would think,</v>

4230
01:51:39.621 --> 01:51:39.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4231
01:51:39.801 --> 01:51:44.750
<v Speaker 2>let's get the baddest rock guitarist and have him do a solo with Michael</v>

4232
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Jackson.</v>

4233
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Like who he played guitar,</v>

4234
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4235
01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:49.071
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4236
01:51:49.071 --> 01:51:50.240
<v Speaker 2>but that was yeah.</v>

4237
01:51:50.241 --> 01:51:50.711
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>

4238
01:51:50.711 --> 01:51:51.800
<v Speaker 2>but people don't know like,</v>

4239
01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4240
01:51:52.050 --> 01:51:53.150
<v Speaker 2>and the videos,</v>

4241
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 2>cause that was when video just started and he had dance shit.</v>

4242
01:51:57.410 --> 01:52:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Like when he did that thing in smooth criminal where he leaned forward,</v>

4243
01:52:00.710 --> 01:52:01.543
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4244
01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.160
<v Speaker 2>that's not humanly possible,</v>

4245
01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.000
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

4246
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.151
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4247
01:52:06.151 --> 01:52:06.690
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

4248
01:52:06.690 --> 01:52:07.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4249
01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:07.950
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

4250
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:09.330
<v Speaker 4>no one before him.</v>

4251
01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.700
<v Speaker 4>There was no one that you could compare him to.</v>

4252
01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4253
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Like you could say,</v>

4254
01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:14.760
<v Speaker 4>you look at Elvis and you go,</v>

4255
01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:15.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4256
01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.000
<v Speaker 4>Elvis was really good singer and a good performer,</v>

4257
01:52:18.001 --> 01:52:22.290
<v Speaker 4>but Elvis kind of borrowed a little bit from the old rhythm and blues guys.</v>

4258
01:52:22.291 --> 01:52:25.440
<v Speaker 4>And they borrowed a little bit from the way Chuck Berry's to dance.</v>

4259
01:52:25.441 --> 01:52:29.130
<v Speaker 4>And there was a little bit of this and a little bit of that when Michael Jackson</v>

4260
01:52:29.131 --> 01:52:29.571
<v Speaker 4>came along,</v>

4261
01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:29.941
<v Speaker 4>you gotta go,</v>

4262
01:52:29.941 --> 01:52:30.740
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4263
01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:31.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4264
01:52:31.610 --> 01:52:32.443
<v Speaker 2>Compare that to any,</v>

4265
01:52:33.130 --> 01:52:35.270
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing about Michael Jackson,</v>

4266
01:52:35.271 --> 01:52:38.270
<v Speaker 2>and I always said that this is the part people don't talk about,</v>

4267
01:52:38.271 --> 01:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>like he was world famous at 10.</v>

4268
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:43.400
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like when you talk about he's fucked up.</v>

4269
01:52:43.401 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>What can you imagine everyone in the</v>

4270
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 4>world knowing who you were when you're like 10 years old?</v>

4271
01:52:48.861 --> 01:52:49.694
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4272
01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:50.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4273
01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:53.480
<v Speaker 4>by the time you're 15 adult women pass out,</v>

4274
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:54.081
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4275
01:52:54.081 --> 01:52:57.590
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine walking into a room and having people pass out just because you</v>

4276
01:52:57.591 --> 01:52:58.371
<v Speaker 4>walked in a room,</v>

4277
01:52:58.371 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 4>they're overcome and they literally think like,</v>

4278
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:02.990
<v Speaker 4>how does that affect you,</v>

4279
01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:04.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4280
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:05.300
<v Speaker 4>as a person?</v>

4281
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:06.201
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4282
01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:06.500
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4283
01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I think we all have that weird effect.</v>

4284
01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4285
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.930
<v Speaker 4>when we meet someone who we can't believe we're really meeting them and we're</v>

4286
01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:13.160
<v Speaker 4>just like taken aback like,</v>

4289
01:53:15.261 --> 01:53:16.730
<v Speaker 4>We've all had that weird effect.</v>

4290
01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.830
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's on a low level,</v>

4291
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.311
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4292

4300
01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:28.173
<v Speaker 4>Louie c guys here.</v>

4301
01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:31.250
<v Speaker 4>When that guy would walk into a room,</v>

4302
01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 4>it was that times a million,</v>

4303
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:33.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4304
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:36.890
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing like it and no way to prepare for it.</v>

4305
01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.240
<v Speaker 4>And he never had a normal life.</v>

4306
01:53:38.241 --> 01:53:41.810
<v Speaker 4>Like you were talking about your career as an airplane mechanic and like you,</v>

4307
01:53:41.811 --> 01:53:43.970
<v Speaker 4>you knew regular people,</v>

4308
01:53:43.971 --> 01:53:45.440
<v Speaker 4>you had regular jobs,</v>

4309
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 4>he had been to jail,</v>

4310
01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:47.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4311
01:53:47.301 --> 01:53:47.421
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4312
01:53:47.421 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 4>all the whole deal.</v>

4313
01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:49.450
<v Speaker 4>You ran the whole gamut as an,</v>

4314
01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:51.200
<v Speaker 4>as a grown adult human being.</v>

4315
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 4>This kid camera when he was in the Jackson five and his fucking brothers,</v>

4316
01:53:56.510 --> 01:54:01.040
<v Speaker 4>his brothers who were all grown ass men had a sit back and watch that little</v>

4317
01:54:01.130 --> 01:54:05.750
<v Speaker 4>brother just run shit because their dad gave birth to this one.</v>

4318
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 4>Just super genius.</v>

4319
01:54:07.221 --> 01:54:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Like they had all these kids and everybody was really talented.</v>

4320
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Latoya and Janet and Jermaine.</v>

4321
01:54:12.501 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was talented.</v>

4322
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:15.590
<v Speaker 4>But then there was this little motherfucker,</v>

4323
01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 4>the last one out of the box that just had magic,</v>

4324
01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4325
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:21.170
<v Speaker 4>He hadn't magic.</v>

4326
01:54:21.170 --> 01:54:22.730
<v Speaker 4>And then you're getting back the Cosby,</v>

4327
01:54:22.731 --> 01:54:23.810
<v Speaker 4>what you're talking about.</v>

4328
01:54:23.811 --> 01:54:28.811
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is like how many hundred million dollars did he give to United</v>

4329
01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:29.330
<v Speaker 4>Negro College Fund?</v>

4330
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:32.660
<v Speaker 4>Like are kids like bill Cosby paid for my college education?</v>

4331
01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:33.831
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4332
01:54:33.831 --> 01:54:37.580
<v Speaker 4>So it's just such a weird thing.</v>

4333
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:38.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's awesome.</v>

4334
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Often like human beings that are flawed,</v>

4335
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:42.320
<v Speaker 4>they're not flawed in every way,</v>

4336
01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:42.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4337
01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.970
<v Speaker 4>They're not all bad.</v>

4338
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:45.860
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of people that do terrible things,</v>

4339
01:54:45.861 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 4>but they were actually really good with other things.</v>

4340
01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:50.510
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4341
01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:51.440
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4342
01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4343
01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.281
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

4344
01:54:52.281 --> 01:54:52.940
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

4345
01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:53.773
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

4346
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:56.930
<v Speaker 4>My friend Eddie has an interesting theory about bill Cosby.</v>

4347
01:54:57.170 --> 01:54:57.650
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

4348
01:54:57.650 --> 01:54:58.161
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

4349
01:54:58.161 --> 01:54:59.060
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day,</v>

4350
01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Bill Cosby at,</v>

4351
01:55:00.670 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 4>even though he was super famous and he probably got turned down,</v>

4352
01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:06.080
<v Speaker 4>he probably got turned down occasionally.</v>

4353
01:55:06.081 --> 01:55:07.730
<v Speaker 4>It probably drove him crazy and didn't like it.</v>

4354
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 4>And so when like one of these,</v>

4355
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 4>one of the stories that I was listening,</v>

4356
01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.313
<v Speaker 4>I was reading rather,</v>

4357
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:12.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4358
01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:15.380
<v Speaker 4>whether the girl was talking about her experiences that Bill Cosby,</v>

4359
01:55:15.381 --> 01:55:18.670
<v Speaker 4>that it started out and it's like mentor friendship sort of relationship that</v>

4360
01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:21.530
<v Speaker 4>eventually he drugged her and then fucked her while she was passed out,</v>

4361
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:23.150
<v Speaker 4>like can and that she,</v>

4362
01:55:23.151 --> 01:55:23.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4363
01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.310
<v Speaker 4>she just felt violated and horrible.</v>

4364
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:30.310
<v Speaker 4>But it was this mentor thing that he would angle in first and then when he</v>

4365
01:55:30.951 --> 01:55:32.750
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get the pussy that way and was like,</v>

4366
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:33.081
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4367
01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:33.800
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4368
01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 4>have a Cappucino.</v>

4369
01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4370
01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:36.020
<v Speaker 4>Do you want a Cappuccino?</v>

4371
01:55:36.021 --> 01:55:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Here you go,</v>

4372
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:37.250
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

4373
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:38.031
<v Speaker 4>And the next thing you know,</v>

4374
01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:38.781
<v Speaker 4>she's passed out.</v>

4375
01:55:38.781 --> 01:55:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Like he got tired of working for it and decided to just go back to his bag of</v>

4376
01:55:42.291 --> 01:55:43.030
<v Speaker 4>tricks.</v>

4377
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Might've been,</v>

4378
01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4379
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I again,</v>

4380
01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I have no,</v>

4381
01:55:46.450 --> 01:55:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea cause I,</v>

4382
01:55:47.861 --> 01:55:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine it's also,</v>

4383
01:55:49.901 --> 01:55:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4384
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:52.300
<v Speaker 2>because it's something I can't imagine doing.</v>

4385
01:55:52.330 --> 01:55:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what the motivation would be.</v>

4386
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4387
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:55.571
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4388
01:55:55.571 --> 01:55:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

4389
01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:56.850
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4390
01:55:56.850 --> 01:55:57.730
<v Speaker 2>it's so evil.</v>

4391
01:55:57.970 --> 01:55:58.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4392
01:55:59.080 --> 01:55:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4393
01:55:59.790 --> 01:56:00.061
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

4394
01:56:00.061 --> 01:56:00.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4395
01:56:00.271 --> 01:56:03.060
<v Speaker 4>this woman was on television talking about it and,</v>

4396
01:56:03.061 --> 01:56:03.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4397
01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I think she was a lawyer and she was saying,</v>

4398
01:56:06.690 --> 01:56:06.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4399
01:56:06.871 --> 01:56:10.590
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about the legal ramifications and apparently one of these</v>

4400
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:11.424
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

4401
01:56:11.490 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 4>her accusation is inside of the statute of limitations.</v>

4402
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:16.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4403
01:56:16.141 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 4>But they're not going to bring him to trial.</v>

4404
01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:18.503
<v Speaker 4>You don't think something that,</v>

4405
01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:20.010
<v Speaker 4>what do you think was going to happen?</v>

4406
01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:20.421
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4407
01:56:20.421 --> 01:56:20.820
<v Speaker 2>he's going to,</v>

4408
01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.980
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost them a lot of money.</v>

4409
01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:23.210
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna pay,</v>

4410
01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:23.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4411
01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:24.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4412
01:56:24.231 --> 01:56:24.740
<v Speaker 2>whether they,</v>

4413
01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:25.700
<v Speaker 2>whether it be some,</v>

4414
01:56:25.701 --> 01:56:26.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4415
01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Gloria.</v>

4416
01:56:27.381 --> 01:56:30.640
<v Speaker 2>All red has the class action lawsuits.</v>

4417
01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.520
<v Speaker 2>So whether it's like,</v>

4418
01:56:31.521 --> 01:56:31.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4419
01:56:31.821 --> 01:56:35.170
<v Speaker 2>we give her a ton of money and she divides it up amongst the women,</v>

4420
01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:35.940
<v Speaker 4>or she goes,</v>

4421
01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking crazy trip and buys a Rolls Royce fingers or herself for the Gold</v>

4422
01:56:40.141 --> 01:56:40.974
<v Speaker 4>Dildo.</v>

4423
01:56:41.410 --> 01:56:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Or they come up with something else like you.</v>

4424
01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:48.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what I thought was was like weird and it was funny,</v>

4425
01:56:48.881 --> 01:56:51.190
<v Speaker 2>but in a horrible way with Jared.</v>

4426
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4427
01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.600
<v Speaker 2>With Jared paid like a 1.4 million so that 14 victims get 100,000 each.</v>

4428
01:57:00.671 --> 01:57:01.181
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

4429
01:57:01.181 --> 01:57:02.014
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4430
01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:05.260
<v Speaker 2>so 14 kids who he solicited,</v>

4431
01:57:05.261 --> 01:57:10.261
<v Speaker 2>he offered money for sex to solution is to pay them each $100,000 out of the</v>

4432
01:57:10.991 --> 01:57:12.610
<v Speaker 2>settlement as shit.</v>

4433
01:57:12.611 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

4434
01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4435
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:15.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible thing to laugh at,</v>

4436
01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:16.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

4437
01:57:16.330 --> 01:57:18.280
<v Speaker 2>isn't it something wrong with that,</v>

4438
01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.380
<v Speaker 2>but that's how it's going to go down.</v>

4439
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.611
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4440
01:57:20.611 --> 01:57:25.611
<v Speaker 4>it's another parallel that Jared and bill Cosby or like in that bill Cosby is</v>

4441
01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.220
<v Speaker 4>undoubtedly a piece of shit.</v>

4442
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.611
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

4443
01:57:28.611 --> 01:57:29.391
<v Speaker 4>At this point in time,</v>

4444
01:57:29.391 --> 01:57:30.640
<v Speaker 4>anybody that thinks he's not guilty,</v>

4445
01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:31.910
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be crazy.</v>

4446
01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4447
01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.290
<v Speaker 4>So he's a piece of shit,</v>

4448
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:36.070
<v Speaker 4>but he's also one of the greatest comics of all time.</v>

4449
01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:36.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4450
01:57:36.250 --> 01:57:39.440
<v Speaker 4>You can't take that away from him and Jared from subway,</v>

4451
01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:42.310
<v Speaker 4>he still lost a hundred pounds and I what to say?</v>

4452
01:57:42.311 --> 01:57:42.841
<v Speaker 4>He's hard.</v>

4453
01:57:42.841 --> 01:57:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4454
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:44.060
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to lose a hundred pounds.</v>

4455
01:57:44.061 --> 01:57:45.260
<v Speaker 4>He might've fucked a few kids,</v>

4456
01:57:45.590 --> 01:57:48.420
<v Speaker 4>but that guy lost a hundred pounds and uh,</v>

4457
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.180
<v Speaker 4>he did it eat and shitty sandwiches.</v>

4458
01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4459
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:51.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's even more impressive.</v>

4460
01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.193
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4461
01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:54.920
<v Speaker 4>when you eat,</v>

4462
01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:57.410
<v Speaker 4>if you're eating subway sandwiches and still losing a hundred pounds,</v>

4463
01:57:57.411 --> 01:57:58.790
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking put in some work bed.</v>

4464
01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.660
<v Speaker 4>It's running uphill.</v>

4465
01:57:59.930 --> 01:58:00.830
<v Speaker 4>Jared gets to say,</v>

4466
01:58:00.831 --> 01:58:00.981
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4467
01:58:00.981 --> 01:58:02.660
<v Speaker 4>I've got one thing in common Cosby,</v>

4468
01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:05.300
<v Speaker 4>like if not really not,</v>

4469
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:06.020
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4470
01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:06.860
<v Speaker 4>nothing in common.</v>

4471
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:08.630
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking freak.</v>

4472
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:10.940
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking freaky creep.</v>

4473
01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:13.121
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

4474
01:58:13.121 --> 01:58:16.390
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew it when his best friend was like a pedophile.</v>

4475
01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:19.570
<v Speaker 4>How did his best friend come out as a pedophile?</v>

4476
01:58:19.571 --> 01:58:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Is that recent?</v>

4477
01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Is that a recent discovery?</v>

4478
01:58:21.250 --> 01:58:22.061
<v Speaker 4>That's how they,</v>

4479
01:58:22.061 --> 01:58:22.894
<v Speaker 4>that's how they,</v>

4480
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I found him was through his best friend.</v>

4481
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when they knew it about his best friend,</v>

4482
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:32.601
<v Speaker 2>but his best friend like ran his charity organization and I don't know if his</v>

4483
01:58:33.031 --> 01:58:36.150
<v Speaker 2>friend was a registered sex offender or when it came up,</v>

4484
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:37.253
<v Speaker 2>but that's how they,</v>

4485
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.880
<v Speaker 2>that's what led to Jared first,</v>

4486
01:58:38.881 --> 01:58:39.451
<v Speaker 2>the friend.</v>

4487
01:58:39.451 --> 01:58:41.350
<v Speaker 2>And then rarely.</v>

4488
01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:42.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4489
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that.</v>

4490
01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4491
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Now that you're saying that.</v>

4492
01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember briefly by the time I was,</v>

4493
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:50.110
<v Speaker 3>it was on my radar.</v>

4494
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.310
<v Speaker 3>He was already arrested.</v>

4495
01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4496
01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 3>And he was already going to jail.</v>

4497
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:53.471
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4498
01:58:53.471 --> 01:58:58.270
<v Speaker 3>I first heard about it when his friend got arrested and they would like this guy</v>

4499
01:58:58.271 --> 01:59:03.271
<v Speaker 3>runs Jareds charity organization and I don't know if he had anything to do with</v>

4500
01:59:03.911 --> 01:59:04.570
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

4501
01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:05.530
<v Speaker 3>Like if it was like,</v>

4502
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:06.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4503
01:59:06.311 --> 01:59:07.900
<v Speaker 3>little league or whatever,</v>

4504
01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:10.840
<v Speaker 3>but there was something wrong with this guy.</v>

4505
01:59:10.841 --> 01:59:15.841
<v Speaker 3>Being involved in a charity and helping children does no worse cause they're</v>

4506
01:59:16.061 --> 01:59:17.080
<v Speaker 3>both awful.</v>

4507
01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:19.180
<v Speaker 3>But somehow it is worse.</v>

4508
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Somehow fucking kids is worse than drug and people and having sex with them.</v>

4509
01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4510
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

4511
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you do it,</v>

4512
01:59:25.341 --> 01:59:26.230
<v Speaker 3>it's all worse.</v>

4513
01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:27.610
<v Speaker 3>It's all sick.</v>

4514
01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:31.030
<v Speaker 3>But I think the thing about kids is like kids aren't sexual.</v>

4515
01:59:31.150 --> 01:59:31.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4516
01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:32.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4517
01:59:32.411 --> 01:59:34.720
<v Speaker 3>women are women like it.</v>

4518
01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:37.210
<v Speaker 3>If you have a sexual attraction to women,</v>

4519
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.350
<v Speaker 3>that is normal.</v>

4520
01:59:38.370 --> 01:59:40.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean drugging them and raping them isn't,</v>

4521
01:59:40.091 --> 01:59:41.350
<v Speaker 3>but they are women.</v>

4522
01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:43.090
<v Speaker 3>But with kids,</v>

4523
01:59:43.091 --> 01:59:45.760
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing sexual about a kid.</v>

4524
01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4525
01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:47.350
<v Speaker 3>how old were,</v>

4526
01:59:47.351 --> 01:59:49.330
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have sex with some 15 year olds.</v>

4527
01:59:50.110 --> 01:59:50.943
<v Speaker 3>Asexual.</v>

4528
01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:51.941
<v Speaker 3>They might've been,</v>

4529
01:59:51.941 --> 01:59:52.750
<v Speaker 3>but I think some,</v>

4530
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4531
01:59:53.290 --> 01:59:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Well they,</v>

4532
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:54.783
<v Speaker 3>they only,</v>

4533
01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:57.820
<v Speaker 3>part of his plea was only one count.</v>

4534
01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.500
<v Speaker 3>So he don't like,</v>

4535
01:59:59.501 --> 02:00:00.071
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

4536
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:01.720
<v Speaker 3>they're only charging them what one,</v>

4537
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:03.520
<v Speaker 3>even though there were others involved.</v>

4538
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:07.840
<v Speaker 3>So do you know what's even so you know something,</v>

4539
02:00:07.841 --> 02:00:08.890
<v Speaker 3>you know what's funny about that?</v>

4540
02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Like he's talking about a 15 year old and like we were talking about this the</v>

4541
02:00:12.491 --> 02:00:13.180
<v Speaker 3>other night,</v>

4542
02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:13.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4543
02:00:13.511 --> 02:00:14.080
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

4544
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:14.540
<v Speaker 3>when uh,</v>

4545
02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:18.700
<v Speaker 3>the 50 year old guy has the 16 year old,</v>

4546
02:00:18.701 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 3>like a 15,</v>

4547
02:00:20.621 --> 02:00:22.420
<v Speaker 3>six year old girl could be hot,</v>

4548
02:00:22.421 --> 02:00:24.640
<v Speaker 3>but she still 15 or 16.</v>

4549
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:25.900
<v Speaker 3>If you're an adult man,</v>

4550
02:00:25.901 --> 02:00:26.650
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

4551
02:00:26.650 --> 02:00:28.570
<v Speaker 3>if you're over 20,</v>

4552
02:00:28.571 --> 02:00:29.440
<v Speaker 3>21 late,</v>

4553
02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:33.100
<v Speaker 3>you still like 18 and a girl 16 that makes sense.</v>

4554
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:34.360
<v Speaker 3>If you're 48,</v>

4555
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:35.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4556
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:36.100
<v Speaker 3>she's a kid.</v>

4557
02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:36.650
<v Speaker 3>That's a baby.</v>

4558
02:00:36.650 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 3>She's a kid that she may have developed.</v>

4559
02:00:38.471 --> 02:00:39.760
<v Speaker 3>She may have the body,</v>

4560
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.960
<v Speaker 3>she may,</v>

4561
02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4562
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.820
<v Speaker 3>walk around half naked.</v>

4563
02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Don't be alone with her,</v>

4564
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 3>but you can't get out of the room.</v>

4565
02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:48.610
<v Speaker 3>It's still a kid.</v>

4566
02:00:48.611 --> 02:00:49.510
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't,</v>

4567
02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:50.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4568
02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:52.770
<v Speaker 3>the problem on the same day,</v>

4569
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:55.510
<v Speaker 3>five instincts are horrible.</v>

4570
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Instincts are horrible.</v>

4571
02:00:56.861 --> 02:00:57.521
<v Speaker 3>If you got a girl,</v>

4572
02:00:57.521 --> 02:01:00.700
<v Speaker 3>like that girl I was talking about in Houston that Ian and I met Ted at this</v>

4573
02:01:00.701 --> 02:01:01.421
<v Speaker 3>tiny waist,</v>

4574
02:01:01.421 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 3>this big juicy ass,</v>

4575
02:01:02.741 --> 02:01:04.090
<v Speaker 3>like she was a grown woman.</v>

4576
02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:04.900
<v Speaker 3>But if she was,</v>

4577
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:08.310
<v Speaker 3>she's probably built like that when she was 14 I had a buddy he used,</v>

4578
02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:08.860
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4579
02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:09.970
<v Speaker 3>he's a principal now,</v>

4580
02:01:09.971 --> 02:01:14.971
<v Speaker 3>but he taught high school when he was like 2124 so he's the guy that 16 and 17</v>

4581
02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:18.881
<v Speaker 3>year old girls,</v>

4582
02:01:18.881 --> 02:01:20.850
<v Speaker 3>they want him because he's,</v>

4583
02:01:20.851 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>and it was like,</v>

4584
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:22.564

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4641
02:02:45.951 --> 02:02:50.450
<v Speaker 3>here's one of the issues that's happening right now with kids and technology is</v>

4642
02:02:50.451 --> 02:02:54.890
<v Speaker 3>that young people are taking photographs of themselves naked and passing it out</v>

4643
02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:58.610
<v Speaker 3>to their friends and then getting busted for child pornography.</v>

4644
02:02:58.770 --> 02:03:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a girl that she's 15 years old and she would send dude's pictures</v>

4645
02:03:03.021 --> 02:03:04.820
<v Speaker 3>of her pussy and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4647
02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:08.090
<v Speaker 3>just what it sent it to them in text messages.</v>

4648
02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:13.660
<v Speaker 3>The cops arrested her and charged her with trafficking child pornography to</v>

4649
02:03:13.941 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 3>other children.</v>

4650
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4651
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

4652
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.020
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those that if they want to bring you down,</v>

4653
02:03:18.021 --> 02:03:19.430
<v Speaker 3>they can use that charge.</v>

4654
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:20.293
<v Speaker 3>But they couldn't,</v>

4655
02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 3>they was,</v>

4656
02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:22.760
<v Speaker 3>she wound up getting cleared of it because the judge was like,</v>

4657
02:03:22.761 --> 02:03:23.001
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

4658
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:24.260

02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.401

4660
02:03:24.401 --> 02:03:24.891
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you,</v>

4661
02:03:24.891 --> 02:03:25.090
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

4662
02:03:25.090 --> 02:03:27.200
<v Speaker 3>how coming out there arresting robbers.</v>

4663
02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Like why you trying to stop a young girl from showing a picture of her pussy?</v>

4664
02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4665
02:03:31.450 --> 02:03:32.283
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

4666
02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:33.410
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things,</v>

4667
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:34.101
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

4668
02:03:34.101 --> 02:03:35.630
<v Speaker 3>they can charge them with it.</v>

4669
02:03:35.631 --> 02:03:36.680
<v Speaker 3>They don't always,</v>

4670
02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:37.941
<v Speaker 3>but there's a time,</v>

4671
02:03:37.941 --> 02:03:39.590
<v Speaker 3>like if they want to bring you down,</v>

4672
02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:40.340
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>

4673
02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:43.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of those things they used as a threat against you,</v>

4674
02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.181
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

4675
02:03:44.181 --> 02:03:45.080

<v Speaker 2>How'd you do that?</v>

4769
02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:27.451
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4770
02:05:27.451 --> 02:05:28.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4771
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:29.190
<v Speaker 2>started comedy late,</v>

4772
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:31.290
<v Speaker 2>started comedy at 30.</v>

4773
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So in my thirties,</v>

4774
02:05:32.941 --> 02:05:34.970
<v Speaker 2>when most people have kids and so religious,</v>

4775
02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:36.650
<v Speaker 2>I was an open miker well,</v>

4776
02:05:36.651 --> 02:05:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I did not want the obligation of a family.</v>

4777
02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:41.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4778
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:41.971
<v Speaker 2>it's hard,</v>

4779
02:05:41.971 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4780
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who is married and he has children and he's just starting out</v>

4781
02:05:46.861 --> 02:05:49.550
<v Speaker 2>doing comedy and he doesn't know what to do and he,</v>

4782
02:05:49.551 --> 02:05:50.550
<v Speaker 2>he can't,</v>

4783
02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:52.230
<v Speaker 2>he can't struggle the way we struggled.</v>

4784
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4785
02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:55.530
<v Speaker 2>He can't go and just do a set for 75 bucks,</v>

4786
02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:56.940
<v Speaker 2>five hour drive away,</v>

4787
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

4788
02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:58.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't do all that.</v>

4789
02:05:58.861 --> 02:05:59.790
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

4790
02:05:59.791 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 2>so that was that.</v>

4791
02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:02.033
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

4792
02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:02.851
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4793
02:06:02.851 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 2>dating,</v>

4794
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:07.320
<v Speaker 2>like I started seeing this woman and she's in her late forties and it's</v>

4795
02:06:07.321 --> 02:06:10.170
<v Speaker 2>fantastic because she's got a son,</v>

4796
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

4797
02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4798
02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:12.960
<v Speaker 2>almost like he's in his late teens,</v>

4799
02:06:12.961 --> 02:06:14.490
<v Speaker 2>so that's not a big hassle.</v>

4800
02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And she's a woman.</v>

4801
02:06:15.511 --> 02:06:19.560
<v Speaker 2>She's comfortable with who she is and everything's cool and stuff.</v>

4802
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:20.520
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

4803
02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:21.871
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4804
02:06:21.871 --> 02:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>And then you get some,</v>

4805
02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>the worst ones for me early to mid thirties when the date is an interview.</v>

4806
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:31.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4807
02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:35.310
<v Speaker 2>so it's like you do find the right girl.</v>

4808
02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:37.950
<v Speaker 2>How long do you think it would be before you got married?</v>

4809
02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4810
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4811
02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4812
02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>so why don't you have kids?</v>

4813
02:06:40.591 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Are you open to it?</v>

4814
02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about it?</v>

4815
02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

4816
02:06:42.810 --> 02:06:43.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4817
02:06:43.201 --> 02:06:43.471

02:06:43.471 --> 02:06:44.304
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

4819
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:46.180

4823
02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the right one at the right time.</v>

4824
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:50.791
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

4825
02:06:50.791 --> 02:06:52.560
<v Speaker 2>now I'm open to it.</v>

4826
02:06:52.561 --> 02:06:53.191
<v Speaker 2>It could happen,</v>

4827
02:06:53.191 --> 02:06:55.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not really looking at being an old dead,</v>

4828
02:06:56.070 --> 02:06:56.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4829
02:06:56.371 --> 02:07:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I joke about it like if I have a kid now when he's 16,</v>

4830
02:07:00.001 --> 02:07:01.530
<v Speaker 2>if I say you can't have the car,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

4834
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:06.930
<v Speaker 2>There ain't shit I'm going to be able to do like son of a bitch took my car,</v>

4835
02:07:08.490 --> 02:07:09.630
<v Speaker 2>me 69.</v>

4836
02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>It's took my car,</v>

4837
02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:13.010
<v Speaker 2>look at this,</v>

4838
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:14.610
<v Speaker 2>the loan at 69.</v>

4839
02:07:14.611 --> 02:07:15.900
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking yolk still.</v>

4840
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4841
02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4842
02:07:16.690 --> 02:07:18.150
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just do it.</v>

4843
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:18.781
<v Speaker 2>And Dana,</v>

4844
02:07:18.781 --> 02:07:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Jim Smoking crack and fucking hit those weights.</v>

4845
02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Some guys do it and some guys have the APP.</v>

4846
02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I could have it,</v>

4847
02:07:24.811 --> 02:07:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4848
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:26.880
<v Speaker 2>like they say you could have as a man,</v>

4849
02:07:26.881 --> 02:07:30.080
<v Speaker 2>you could always have a kid but do you want to and uh,</v>

4850
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I think now it would be more likely like if I met a woman who had a young kid</v>

4851
02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 2>and I took him on as a stepchild or something like that would be more likely to</v>

4852
02:07:40.181 --> 02:07:40.630
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

4853
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:41.351

4862
02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:57.720
<v Speaker 2>like that's how it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4864
02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:01.410
<v Speaker 2>That's how it happens isn't a true with comics.</v>

4865
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:04.660
<v Speaker 2>The comics either die too young or live forever.</v>

4866
02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:06.220
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of them,</v>

02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like that idea is a,</v>

4875
02:08:15.161 --> 02:08:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there is something real about the fact that you're making people laugh</v>

4876
02:08:18.821 --> 02:08:19.211
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4940
02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:49.870
<v Speaker 2>when Rodney was coming to the left factory,</v>

4941
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4942
02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.900
<v Speaker 2>and in his last days,</v>

4943
02:09:52.901 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Rodney was coming to the laugh factory in a bathrobe.</v>

4944
02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4945
02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

4946
02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 2>He would just come down the hill from his house in his robe.</v>

4947
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4948
02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:01.360
<v Speaker 2>he go home.</v>

4949
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Stay front of arenas in a bathrobe.</v>

4950
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4951
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I was working when I was 19 years old at Great Woods in Mount Mansfield,</v>

4952
02:10:07.571 --> 02:10:08.171
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>

4953
02:10:08.171 --> 02:10:08.711
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>

4954
02:10:08.711 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 2>a performing arts center.</v>

4955
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And I was backstage,</v>

4956
02:10:11.441 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the security guards and Rodney was backstage and I watched him walk</v>

4957
02:10:15.101 --> 02:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>around with a bathrobe on,</v>

4958
02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.680
<v Speaker 2>well that's how Rickles was.</v>

4959
02:10:17.681 --> 02:10:18.820
<v Speaker 2>But that's because of that.</v>

4960
02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day you didn't put your pants on because you would mess up the</v>

4961
02:10:22.721 --> 02:10:23.554
<v Speaker 2>crease.</v>

4962
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:25.110
<v Speaker 2>So we were doing,</v>

4963
02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:25.441
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

4964
02:10:25.441 --> 02:10:26.260
<v Speaker 2>So when we,</v>

4965
02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4966
02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:28.510
<v Speaker 2>there was a Seinfeld episode about that,</v>

4967
02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:29.710
<v Speaker 2>but it really is true.</v>

4968
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 2>When Rickles was backstage in Montreal was in a rope,</v>

4969
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:35.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start performing in a robe.</v>

4984
02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:57.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the only time slippers are for sale.</v>

4992
02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:11.870
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that people said about Rodney.</v>

5017
02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:56.930

<v Speaker 3>And someone's going to be saying that about us.</v>

02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:17.810
<v Speaker 3>What were they thinking?</v>

5037
02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Those guys used to,</v>

5038
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:20.540
<v Speaker 3>there was no internet when they started.</v>

5039
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:23.630
<v Speaker 3>They had to promote themselves by going to local radio shows.</v>

5040
02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:24.510
<v Speaker 3>He would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they had radio back then.</v>

5043
02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:30.410
<v Speaker 3>But that works sometimes,</v>

5044
02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:30.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5045

5049
02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.360

02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:22.971
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

5082
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Tom Joiner,</v>

5083
02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Steve Harvey's one of those dudes.</v>

5084
02:13:26.721 --> 02:13:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Like he's got so many jobs.</v>

5085
02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>He does so many things that he puts out a new book like every year.</v>

5086
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Does he write those books?</v>

5087
02:13:33.690 --> 02:13:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably wrote the first one.</v>

5088
02:13:35.461 --> 02:13:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much he writes.</v>

5089
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much more but,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

5092
02:13:39.661 --> 02:13:39.871
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5093
02:13:39.871 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 3>and the funny thing is it's not like any genius advice,</v>

02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

5095
02:13:45.571 --> 02:13:45.811
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

5096
02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:45.991
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5097
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:47.370
<v Speaker 3>if you want to keep a good man,</v>

5098
02:13:47.850 --> 02:13:49.980
<v Speaker 3>don't be a whole no,</v>

5099
02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:50.963
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5100
02:13:51.310 --> 02:13:52.770
<v Speaker 3>like where your dress a little long,</v>

5101
02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:53.150
<v Speaker 3>it puts,</v>

5102
02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:54.300
<v Speaker 3>put away your whole shoes,</v>

5103
02:13:54.301 --> 02:13:54.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5104
02:13:54.631 --> 02:13:55.461
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

5105
02:13:55.461 --> 02:13:55.801
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5106
02:13:55.801 --> 02:13:56.251
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

5107
02:13:56.251 --> 02:13:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of that.</v>

5108
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5109
02:13:58.650 --> 02:14:00.270
<v Speaker 3>so I shouldn't be a Ho.</v>

5110
02:14:00.970 --> 02:14:03.090
<v Speaker 3>He's an odd character that Steve Harvey.</v>

5111
02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5112
02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:06.380
<v Speaker 3>I met him once for a loop.</v>

5113
02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:10.050
<v Speaker 3>We joked around a little while he was hosting the Apollo and I did it.</v>

5114
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:11.311
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5115
02:14:11.311 --> 02:14:12.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5116
02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:12.661
<v Speaker 3>they was cool,</v>

5117
02:14:12.661 --> 02:14:14.130
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know him,</v>

5118
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:14.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5119
02:14:14.611 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any,</v>

5120
02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 3>any relationship with him.</v>

5121
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I had somebody the other day texted me,</v>

5122
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:21.000
<v Speaker 3>can I,</v>

5123
02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.100
<v Speaker 3>can I get them tickets to Kevin Hart?</v>

5124
02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

5125
02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get me tickets.</v>

5126
02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:28.021
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

5127
02:14:28.021 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 3>I did bt with Kevin Hart once,</v>

5128
02:14:29.971 --> 02:14:30.804
<v Speaker 3>an old one.</v>

5129
02:14:30.810 --> 02:14:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Kevin's gonna stop shitting and say,</v>

5130
02:14:32.821 --> 02:14:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck Alonzo's at the door.</v>

5131
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:37.201
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5132
02:14:37.201 --> 02:14:38.550
<v Speaker 3>they think that we know everybody,</v>

5133
02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:39.070
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

5134
02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:39.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5135
02:14:39.361 --> 02:14:40.000
<v Speaker 3>everybody in this,</v>

5136
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.610
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people in that business.</v>

5137
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:42.600
<v Speaker 3>But even when you know,</v>

5138
02:14:42.601 --> 02:14:44.520
<v Speaker 3>people at certain times when it's a little,</v>

5139
02:14:44.521 --> 02:14:47.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a little awkward to hit him up.</v>

5140
02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5141
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5142
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:48.571
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5143
02:14:48.571 --> 02:14:53.190
<v Speaker 3>like Chapelle was doing a bunch of shows in Montreal and I know him,</v>

5144
02:14:53.191 --> 02:14:53.941
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him well,</v>

5145
02:14:53.941 --> 02:14:54.511
<v Speaker 3>but I know him,</v>

5146
02:14:54.511 --> 02:14:55.740
<v Speaker 3>but I just bought tickets.</v>

5147
02:14:55.741 --> 02:14:56.574
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>

5148
02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:57.601
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

5149
02:14:57.601 --> 02:14:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Try to get to him and then like,</v>

5150
02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:01.200
<v Speaker 3>then it gets fucking awkward,</v>

5151
02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:01.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5152
02:15:01.561 --> 02:15:02.071
<v Speaker 3>cause you know,</v>

5153
02:15:02.071 --> 02:15:06.120
<v Speaker 3>a thousand people are hitting them up while you're up there.</v>

5154
02:15:06.121 --> 02:15:06.750
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

5155
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:07.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5156
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:07.973
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

5157
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:09.960
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather just go and have a good time.</v>

5158
02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:10.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5159
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Those are the awkward calls or texts you get from people that you barely know</v>

5160
02:15:13.621 --> 02:15:14.700
<v Speaker 3>and they want something you,</v>

5161
02:15:14.770 --> 02:15:15.603
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5162
02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5163
02:15:17.190 --> 02:15:19.080
<v Speaker 3>And do you don't feel weird asking me for this.</v>

5164
02:15:19.570 --> 02:15:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5165
02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:20.461
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't end.</v>

5166
02:15:20.461 --> 02:15:20.911
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

5167
02:15:20.911 --> 02:15:22.140
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't bother them a bit.</v>

5168
02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:22.381
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

5169
02:15:22.381 --> 02:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Some people are brutal too.</v>

5170
02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:24.413
<v Speaker 3>They just keep hitting it.</v>

5171
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:28.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's really funny when you ask me for someone else.</v>

5172
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5173
02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

5174
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:29.941
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

5175
02:15:29.941 --> 02:15:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I heard you on Joe Rogan's podcast.</v>

5176
02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:33.000
<v Speaker 3>I want to go to UFC.</v>

5177
02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:34.171

5179
02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz gets that.</v>

5180
02:15:36.630 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 3>He gets out all the time.</v>

5181
02:15:37.670 --> 02:15:37.890
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>

02:15:38.191 --> 02:15:38.670
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

5184
02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

5185
02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Cause you guys are tight.</v>

5186
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.580
<v Speaker 3>He gets angry at people.</v>

5187
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:42.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5188
02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:45.510
<v Speaker 3>people want to get on this podcast and they tried to go through Joey.</v>

5189
02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:46.640
<v Speaker 3>He gets,</v>

5190
02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.230
<v Speaker 3>he can't go through Joey and then fucking angry.</v>

5191
02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:53.670
<v Speaker 3>The thing is the people you would give it to are the ones who will never ask.</v>

5192
02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5193
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:54.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5194
02:15:54.851 --> 02:15:56.550
<v Speaker 3>You know the ones you'd be happy to do it for.</v>

5195
02:15:56.551 --> 02:15:59.970
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who would never ask you for,</v>

5196
02:15:59.971 --> 02:16:00.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5197
02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:00.970
<v Speaker 3>for anything.</v>

5198
02:16:00.970 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that have that distorted misconception that this,</v>

5199
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:08.790
<v Speaker 3>this business is all about finding the right connections and then those</v>

5200
02:16:08.791 --> 02:16:09.511
<v Speaker 3>connections,</v>

5201
02:16:09.511 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 3>like you have to work those connections.</v>

5202
02:16:10.861 --> 02:16:11.940
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you get to the business.</v>

5203
02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:13.110
<v Speaker 3>That's what you get for those.</v>

5204
02:16:13.111 --> 02:16:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Some people do that.</v>

5205
02:16:14.610 --> 02:16:14.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5206
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:15.594
<v Speaker 3>but they're not good.</v>

5207
02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:16.080
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

5208
02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:16.531
<v Speaker 3>It is good.</v>

5209
02:16:16.531 --> 02:16:16.740
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

5210
02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.510
<v Speaker 3>not talent,</v>

5211
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:18.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

5212
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:20.880
<v Speaker 3>it's salesmanship backstage.</v>

5213
02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:22.650
<v Speaker 3>It's being everyone's friend.</v>

5214
02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:26.640
<v Speaker 3>One thing that does happen for sure is that you find someone who's really funny</v>

5215
02:16:26.641 --> 02:16:27.091
<v Speaker 3>and then you go,</v>

5216
02:16:27.091 --> 02:16:27.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5217
02:16:27.211 --> 02:16:28.260
<v Speaker 3>who's that dude hanging out with?</v>

5218
02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:29.230
<v Speaker 3>And then you out.</v>

5219
02:16:29.230 --> 02:16:29.561
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5220
02:16:29.561 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 3>he's got friends.</v>

5221
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:32.380
<v Speaker 4>Like Garrett guarantee you their friends are funny.</v>

5222
02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:33.341
<v Speaker 4>If they're funny,</v>

5223
02:16:33.341 --> 02:16:35.530
<v Speaker 4>like if you know Ari should fear and you go,</v>

5224
02:16:35.531 --> 02:16:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Ari's funny shit.</v>

5225
02:16:36.431 --> 02:16:36.611
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>

5226
02:16:36.611 --> 02:16:37.570
<v Speaker 4>who's always friend,</v>

5227
02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:38.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5228
02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:40.510
<v Speaker 4>like Ari has some friends from New York that I don't even know.</v>

5229
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:41.261
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

5230
02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:41.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5231
02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:41.801
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5232
02:16:41.801 --> 02:16:42.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5233
02:16:42.221 --> 02:16:43.510
<v Speaker 4>he tells me about them and I'm like,</v>

5234
02:16:43.511 --> 02:16:43.601
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5235
02:16:43.601 --> 02:16:44.470
<v Speaker 4>I want to meet that dude.</v>

5236
02:16:44.471 --> 02:16:44.651
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5237
02:16:44.651 --> 02:16:45.191
<v Speaker 4>like I go,</v>

5238
02:16:45.191 --> 02:16:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I want to have that guy.</v>

5239
02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Cause they wouldn't be hanging out with him if they weren't.</v>

5240
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:50.620
<v Speaker 4>If he tells you they're funny.</v>

5241
02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:51.483
<v Speaker 4>They're funny.</v>

5242
02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:52.720
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely that.</v>

5243
02:16:52.721 --> 02:16:54.550
<v Speaker 4>There's that sort of connection that definitely helps.</v>

5244
02:16:54.551 --> 02:16:55.660
<v Speaker 4>But you gotta be talented.</v>

5245
02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:56.853
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you're not,</v>

5246
02:16:57.310 --> 02:17:01.600
<v Speaker 4>we all have those few friends that were friends with back from 15 whatever years</v>

5247
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 4>ago and then not really that good,</v>

5248
02:17:02.741 --> 02:17:04.630
<v Speaker 4>but you're still kind of friends with them and they're like,</v>

5249
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:05.121
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

5250
02:17:05.121 --> 02:17:05.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5251
02:17:05.410 --> 02:17:06.430
<v Speaker 4>why don't you take me on the road with you?</v>

5252
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

5253
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:08.590
<v Speaker 4>how come you never work on your fucking act?</v>

5254
02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:08.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5255
02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

5256
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:10.960
<v Speaker 4>how can we not really comedian,</v>

5257
02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5258
02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:17.200
<v Speaker 2>to people I admired the people who weren't funny who got funny because I mean I</v>

5259
02:17:18.501 --> 02:17:20.180
<v Speaker 2>think I was pretty funny from the start,</v>

5260
02:17:20.181 --> 02:17:20.491
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

5261
02:17:20.491 --> 02:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I know some people who just weren't,</v>

5262
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:23.150
<v Speaker 2>and I had my,</v>

5263
02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:28.150
<v Speaker 2>cause you kept doing it hammering when nobody believed in you when nobody</v>

5264
02:17:28.461 --> 02:17:29.061
<v Speaker 2>thought you were.</v>

5265
02:17:29.061 --> 02:17:30.470
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you weren't funny.</v>

5266
02:17:30.471 --> 02:17:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you were just bombing,</v>

5267
02:17:31.611 --> 02:17:35.660
<v Speaker 2>but you knew there was something there and you kept doing it.</v>

5268
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I admire that.</v>

5269
02:17:36.741 --> 02:17:41.741
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a lot harder than being funny and just going out and being funny.</v>

5270
02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

5271
02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to name any names,</v>

5272
02:17:43.851 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 2>but I know for</v>

5273
02:17:44.410 --> 02:17:45.250
<v Speaker 4>guys that are like that,</v>

5274
02:17:45.251 --> 02:17:47.140
<v Speaker 4>they just incrementally got better.</v>

5275
02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5276
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:48.430
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

5277
02:17:48.431 --> 02:17:50.560
<v Speaker 4>just kept chipping away and kept chipping away.</v>

5278
02:17:50.561 --> 02:17:53.230
<v Speaker 4>And then once they started to develop in real confidence,</v>

5279
02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:54.820
<v Speaker 4>then it started taking off for them.</v>

5280
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:56.350
<v Speaker 4>Then we started getting some momentum.</v>

5281
02:17:57.820 --> 02:17:58.900
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to figure out man.</v>

5282
02:17:58.960 --> 02:17:59.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5283
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:00.161
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>

5284
02:18:00.161 --> 02:18:00.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5285
02:18:00.491 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 4>like you were saying like meat and Comedians,</v>

5286
02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:03.800
<v Speaker 4>you know like uh,</v>

5287
02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Kevin James and I had taken you for a tour of a Montreal.</v>

5288
02:18:07.331 --> 02:18:08.164
<v Speaker 4>It's like yeah,</v>

5289
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:09.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm in awe man.</v>

5290
02:18:10.050 --> 02:18:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Cause it doesn't seem like in the beginning it just doesn't seem like it's going</v>

5291
02:18:13.281 --> 02:18:13.990
<v Speaker 4>to work.</v>

5292
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.530
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

5293
02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:16.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's so it's all of it.</v>

5294
02:18:16.581 --> 02:18:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5295
02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It's so slippery and they're so big.</v>

5296
02:18:18.911 --> 02:18:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember when I started out when I was opening for Tommy Davidson,</v>

5297
02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:25.180
<v Speaker 2>like it's been a summer opening for Shami.</v>

5298
02:18:25.690 --> 02:18:26.471
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5299
02:18:26.471 --> 02:18:27.304
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5300
02:18:27.370 --> 02:18:31.420
<v Speaker 2>when they say his name there's more applause than my best joke.</v>

5301
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Just saying his name.</v>

5302
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.290
<v Speaker 2>He got a bigger applause,</v>

5303
02:18:35.291 --> 02:18:36.040
<v Speaker 2>break them.</v>

5304
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:40.450
<v Speaker 2>But I always felt like it's funny cause sometimes you meet people or you have</v>

5345
02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what you have to do.</v>

5346
02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause it cause you,</v>

5349
02:19:40.090 --> 02:19:43.430
<v Speaker 2>You true sit here and if you got to announce a drinks,</v>

5350
02:19:43.431 --> 02:19:46.610
<v Speaker 2>you better come up with a funny way to announce drinks.</v>

5351
02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:48.020
<v Speaker 2>You know that's,</v>

5352
02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:49.190
<v Speaker 2>that's part of your job.</v>

5353
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:49.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5354
02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's,</v>

5355
02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:52.850
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky working with people on the road to,</v>

5356
02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:53.710
<v Speaker 2>do you find the,</v>

5357
02:19:53.711 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 2>do you ever work with guys that try to steal your shit and step on it?</v>

5358
02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:59.510
<v Speaker 2>They like twist it around a little bit to fuck with your premises.</v>

5359
02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I've heard guys,</v>

5360
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:02.960
<v Speaker 2>not so much that,</v>

5361
02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:03.830
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of that,</v>

5362
02:20:03.831 --> 02:20:08.340
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard them doing something from somebody I know who had been there.</v>

5363
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:10.521
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5364
02:20:10.521 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 2>So they're doing up in Lincoln.</v>

5365
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:13.430
<v Speaker 2>That sounds familiar.</v>

5366
02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:14.991
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like,</v>

5367
02:20:14.991 --> 02:20:15.441
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

5368
02:20:15.441 --> 02:20:16.790
<v Speaker 2>he was here last month.</v>

5369
02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:20.660
<v Speaker 2>But you know when they do that they're not going to get out of that.</v>

5370
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:22.400
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to get out of that circle.</v>

5371
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:23.181
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5372
02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:23.391
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5373
02:20:23.391 --> 02:20:23.661
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

5374
02:20:23.661 --> 02:20:28.460
<v Speaker 2>say they're a middle act and the south and they're stealing material from</v>

5375
02:20:28.461 --> 02:20:30.260
<v Speaker 2>headliners tour in the country,</v>

5376
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:32.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stay a middle act and the south because,</v>

5377
02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:34.130
<v Speaker 2>cause once you leave,</v>

5378
02:20:34.131 --> 02:20:36.350
<v Speaker 2>people know who did that.</v>

5379
02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.670
<v Speaker 2>They know who wrote that.</v>

5380
02:20:37.850 --> 02:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5381
02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5382
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:40.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world now.</v>

5383
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5384
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing a podcast at all?</v>

5385
02:20:42.651 --> 02:20:43.041
<v Speaker 2>You ever thought?</v>

5386
02:20:43.041 --> 02:20:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5387
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:43.731
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5388
02:20:43.731 --> 02:20:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I do a podcast.</v>

5389
02:20:44.841 --> 02:20:45.230
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5390
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.780
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5391
02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:46.171
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

5392
02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:47.000
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting.</v>

5393
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I love my podcasts called who's paying attention and I do kind of a weekly news</v>

5394
02:20:51.471 --> 02:20:52.430
<v Speaker 2>wrap up thing,</v>

5395
02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:54.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's just me talking about shit.</v>

5396
02:20:54.771 --> 02:20:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I read in the news and,</v>

5397
02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.080
<v Speaker 2>and some of it by yourself,</v>

5398
02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:57.231
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5399
02:20:57.231 --> 02:20:59.370
<v Speaker 2>don't burn us the morning podcast.</v>

5400
02:20:59.371 --> 02:21:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is,</v>

5401
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:06.230
<v Speaker 2>some of it is the more insightful stuff that I can't do in the comedy world.</v>

5402
02:21:06.321 --> 02:21:10.970
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give my real opinion on it than other stuff is just me joking about some</v>

5403
02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:13.730
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit in the news or making fun of some stuff in the news.</v>

5404
02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 2>But on occasion I have guests,</v>

5405
02:21:15.771 --> 02:21:19.520
<v Speaker 2>like I did the La podcast festival and I had guests and people like it.</v>

5406
02:21:19.521 --> 02:21:20.630
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I need to,</v>

5407
02:21:20.631 --> 02:21:21.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5408
02:21:21.260 --> 02:21:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I need to take it to the next level.</v>

5409
02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:23.541
<v Speaker 2>What is that like?</v>

5410
02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:25.340
<v Speaker 2>What does the podcast festival like?</v>

5411
02:21:25.341 --> 02:21:25.491
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

5412
02:21:25.491 --> 02:21:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of it was just never been,</v>

5413
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:28.850
<v Speaker 2>it was actually pretty cool.</v>

5414
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:31.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just doing a lot of podcasts.</v>

5415
02:21:31.251 --> 02:21:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Like you would do your podcasts in a room with a big audience.</v>

5416
02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:36.373
<v Speaker 2>That's just it,</v>

5417
02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 2>that that's what it is.</v>

5418
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:37.850
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

5419
02:21:37.850 --> 02:21:41.030
<v Speaker 2>they have different ballrooms set up,</v>

5420
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:41.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5421
02:21:41.721 --> 02:21:42.710
<v Speaker 2>different sizes,</v>

5422
02:21:42.711 --> 02:21:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I guess from like 50 seats to maybe a few hundred seats or I don't know what the</v>

5423
02:21:47.391 --> 02:21:48.350
<v Speaker 2>biggest ones were,</v>

5424
02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:49.460
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

5425
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:49.731
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5426
02:21:49.731 --> 02:21:54.731
<v Speaker 2>and you just do your podcast live for an audience there and they do them one</v>

5427
02:21:54.891 --> 02:21:55.551
<v Speaker 2>after another.</v>

5428
02:21:55.551 --> 02:21:57.110
<v Speaker 2>So the audience that,</v>

5429
02:21:57.111 --> 02:22:02.111
<v Speaker 2>I guess they buy a ticket and say they might listen to your podcast and then</v>

5430
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:07.450
<v Speaker 2>walk out of yours and go listen to Todd glass for a while and come listen to me</v>

5431
02:22:08.391 --> 02:22:08.931
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

5432
02:22:08.931 --> 02:22:09.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5433
02:22:09.231 --> 02:22:09.711
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

5434
02:22:09.711 --> 02:22:10.544
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5435
02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:12.013
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

5436
02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Just that a weekend of podcasts all in one place this year.</v>

5437
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5438
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

5439
02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:17.870
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>

5440
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised it was last month.</v>

5441
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

5442
02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5443
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised because they had asked me to do it before and,</v>

5444
02:22:25.220 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think</v>

5445
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:27.420
<v Speaker 3>a lot about my podcast.</v>

02:22:27.421 --> 02:22:28.254
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm always,</v>

5447
02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm always flattered when people listen to and I get to eat.</v>

5454
02:22:44.851 --> 02:22:45.510

5455
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I like it because I get to just give my opinion on shit.</v>

02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:55.020

<v Speaker 3>The won't those things build man now you're going to get a lot more people</v>

5462
02:22:58.771 --> 02:22:59.604
<v Speaker 3>listening to it.</v>

5463
02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this.</v>

5464
02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:00.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5465
02:23:00.531 --> 02:23:00.900
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

5466
02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:02.040
<v Speaker 3>this is fantastic.</v>

5467
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is great because you're one of the big ones and you've got a huge</v>

5468
02:23:06.031 --> 02:23:07.020
<v Speaker 3>following and this and that.</v>

5469
02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:09.180
<v Speaker 3>But it's also because you and me and we talk about it,</v>

5470
02:23:09.181 --> 02:23:10.720
<v Speaker 3>we don't get to hang that often.</v>

5471
02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:12.690
<v Speaker 3>We've known each other a long time.</v>

5472
02:23:12.691 --> 02:23:14.220
<v Speaker 3>We cross paths here and there,</v>

5473
02:23:14.221 --> 02:23:15.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's just this was,</v>

5474
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:19.050
<v Speaker 3>that's why this was always something I wanted to do and fun.</v>

5475
02:23:19.051 --> 02:23:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Just cause I like you.</v>

5476
02:23:21.970 --> 02:23:26.670
<v Speaker 3>My phone was the last text that I had with you was a year ago before this.</v>

5477
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:27.533
<v Speaker 3>The recent one?</v>

5478
02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:27.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5479
02:23:27.751 --> 02:23:30.780
<v Speaker 3>We ran into each other at the laugh factory and then the last one we were</v>

5480
02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:35.040
<v Speaker 3>planning on doing a podcast but we just pulled it off.</v>

5481
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

5482
02:23:35.490 --> 02:23:35.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5483
02:23:35.851 --> 02:23:36.271
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

5484
02:23:36.271 --> 02:23:37.020
<v Speaker 3>that's how it is,</v>

5485
02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:37.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5486
02:23:37.351 --> 02:23:38.550
<v Speaker 3>cause we're both traveling,</v>

5487
02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:40.230
<v Speaker 3>doing our thing and this and that.</v>

5488
02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the other thing about being friends with comics.</v>

5489
02:23:42.691 --> 02:23:44.430
<v Speaker 3>When you reach the headliner level,</v>

5490
02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you don't see each other anymore.</v>

5491
02:23:46.350 --> 02:23:46.651
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5492
02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Unless you work together,</v>

5493
02:23:47.730 --> 02:23:51.370
<v Speaker 3>you work together or that's like a festival or a show or something like that.</v>

5494
02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:52.400
<v Speaker 3>The store or the laugh,</v>

5495
02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:53.460
<v Speaker 3>archery or the Improv.</v>

5496
02:23:53.490 --> 02:23:55.800
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why I take guys on the road with me too.</v>

5497
02:23:55.980 --> 02:23:56.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5498
02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5499
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5500
02:23:57.330 --> 02:23:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I never use like a local guy.</v>

5501
02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I always take people on the road with me cause I want to work with,</v>

5502
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:02.521
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

5503
02:24:02.521 --> 02:24:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I want to work with really funny guys.</v>

5504
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:05.940
<v Speaker 3>And then I also don't want to be alone.</v>

5505
02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:07.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to work with friends.</v>

5506
02:24:07.410 --> 02:24:09.420
<v Speaker 3>I take people when I can,</v>

5507
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:11.400
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times they are like,</v>

5508
02:24:11.430 --> 02:24:13.890
<v Speaker 3>the places don't want to give up a room or they don't.</v>

5509
02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:15.353
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

5510
02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:18.030
<v Speaker 3>we got a local guy that we pay 50 bucks a show.</v>

5511
02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:19.193
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a guy,</v>

5512
02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:20.880
<v Speaker 3>come in and do 50 bucks,</v>

5513
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:21.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5514
02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:22.133
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

5515
02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I always paid,</v>

5516
02:24:23.730 --> 02:24:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I paid for the hotel room,</v>

5517
02:24:25.501 --> 02:24:27.270
<v Speaker 3>I paid extra money for the guys.</v>

5518
02:24:27.271 --> 02:24:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I always get more money than me.</v>

5519
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5520
02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're aware of this,</v>

5521
02:24:32.370 --> 02:24:33.330
<v Speaker 3>but even when I didn't,</v>

5522
02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:34.980
<v Speaker 3>even when I didn't,</v>

5523
02:24:35.010 --> 02:24:35.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5524
02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:36.200
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

5525
02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:39.330
<v Speaker 3>I did it too many times by myself and it was a crap shoot.</v>

5526
02:24:39.331 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes you'd work on the road and the guys would be fun.</v>

5527
02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:44.790
<v Speaker 3>You'd work with a great middle act and he'd make a new friend.</v>

5528
02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:47.220
<v Speaker 3>But that was half the time.</v>

5529
02:24:47.250 --> 02:24:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5530
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And the other half the time you'd work with idiots and you'd,</v>

5531
02:24:50.611 --> 02:24:53.340
<v Speaker 3>you'd hate yourself and then you'd have to plug your ears while they were on</v>

5532
02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:54.690
<v Speaker 3>stage because they were so terrible.</v>

5533
02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:57.060
<v Speaker 3>You hated the audience by the time he got up there.</v>

5534
02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I hate the places that have their local favorite,</v>

5535
02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5536
02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:06.620
<v Speaker 3>and they put him on your show and either he's like some filthy guy or it's just</v>

5537
02:25:07.501 --> 02:25:08.310
<v Speaker 3>not funny.</v>

5538
02:25:08.310 --> 02:25:08.941
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

5539
02:25:08.941 --> 02:25:09.774
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>

5540
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:14.820
<v Speaker 3>like he's fooling that one audience at that club every week and he thinks he's</v>

5541
02:25:14.821 --> 02:25:15.540
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

5542
02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.130
<v Speaker 3>but you're like,</v>

5543
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.830
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

5544
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:17.401
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5545
02:25:17.401 --> 02:25:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced that.</v>

5546
02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:18.960
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5547
02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:19.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5548
02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:20.040
<v Speaker 3>and you just,</v>

5549
02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:25.040
<v Speaker 3>or the other thing I hate is when the green room is the hangout for the local</v>

5550
02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:25.680
<v Speaker 3>comics.</v>

5551
02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5552
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:26.920
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst.</v>

5553
02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.000
<v Speaker 3>And I've always thought like,</v>

5554
02:25:28.001 --> 02:25:29.890
<v Speaker 3>that's why you have a road manager.</v>

5555
02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5556
02:25:30.270 --> 02:25:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Cause you have somebody to say,</v>

5557
02:25:31.571 --> 02:25:32.404
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

5558
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:33.423
<v Speaker 3>everybody out.</v>

5559
02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:36.820
<v Speaker 3>You know that the worst is when they start bullshitting with you and like you're</v>

5560
02:25:36.821 --> 02:25:37.860
<v Speaker 3>about to go on stage,</v>

5561
02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.650
<v Speaker 3>you're going over your notes and they want to fuck around and hang out and</v>

5562
02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:44.060
<v Speaker 3>they're talking to the waitress and complaining.</v>

5563
02:25:44.061 --> 02:25:44.950
<v Speaker 3>And they're drinking.</v>

5564
02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:45.341
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

5565
02:25:45.341 --> 02:25:45.630
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

5566
02:25:45.630 --> 02:25:46.570
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

5567
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5568
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.130
<v Speaker 3>but you don't even work in here.</v>

5569
02:25:48.370 --> 02:25:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I remember like this was back when I was opening for Tommy.</v>

5570
02:25:51.850 --> 02:25:56.080
<v Speaker 3>We were somewhere and his security guy wouldn't let me in the green room really?</v>

5571
02:25:56.081 --> 02:25:56.741
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

5572
02:25:56.741 --> 02:25:57.011
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

5573
02:25:57.011 --> 02:25:57.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5574
02:25:57.490 --> 02:25:57.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5575
02:25:57.881 --> 02:25:59.230
<v Speaker 3>and I fucked with Tommy about it.</v>

5576
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Cause I knew Tommy and I don't think Tommy knew,</v>

5577
02:26:01.611 --> 02:26:02.444
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

5578
02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:02.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5579
02:26:02.921 --> 02:26:07.921
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of on the show friend of his like not just a fan with the guy wouldn't</v>

5580
02:26:09.911 --> 02:26:10.660
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

5581
02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.990
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't let me in living color areas.</v>

5582
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5583
02:26:13.650 --> 02:26:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Well he was huge back then.</v>

5584

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5585
02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:16.210
<v Speaker 3>What is he up to these days?</v>

5586
02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:19.360
<v Speaker 3>He sees door and he's doing this thing working live.</v>

5587
02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5588
02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:24.780
<v Speaker 3>he did a tour with Tony Rock and some more.</v>

5589
02:26:24.970 --> 02:26:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Tony Rock is fucking hilarious.</v>

5590
02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:27.791
<v Speaker 3>That dude,</v>

5591
02:26:27.791 --> 02:26:29.230
<v Speaker 3>it's funny at Tony's funny.</v>

5592
02:26:29.350 --> 02:26:30.370
<v Speaker 3>So they were on tour.</v>

5593
02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:31.900
<v Speaker 3>They did a tour together.</v>

5594
02:26:31.901 --> 02:26:32.141
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

5595
02:26:32.141 --> 02:26:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Tommy still around still in the game taught.</v>

5596
02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Tony Rock is one of those guys who were like,</v>

5597
02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:40.000
<v Speaker 3>he might have actually been held back by the fact that his brothers Chris Rock,</v>

5598
02:26:40.810 --> 02:26:41.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5599
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:42.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5600
02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.451
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5601
02:26:43.451 --> 02:26:44.201
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

5602
02:26:44.201 --> 02:26:48.940
<v Speaker 3>like I see more similarity in them now than when I first met Tony,</v>

5603
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:51.100
<v Speaker 3>but not intentional similarity.</v>

5604
02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Just in similarity in the sense that they're brothers.</v>

5605
02:26:54.130 --> 02:26:54.580
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

5606
02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:55.413
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5607
02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.110
<v Speaker 3>it's weak because he never talked about it,</v>

5608
02:26:59.590 --> 02:27:00.341
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5609
02:27:00.341 --> 02:27:01.480
<v Speaker 3>he's Chris's brother,</v>

5610
02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:02.711
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

5611
02:27:02.711 --> 02:27:03.071
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

5612
02:27:03.071 --> 02:27:04.090
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't the same.</v>

5613
02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:07.030
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the same as like the weigh ins where you know,</v>

5614
02:27:07.031 --> 02:27:10.420
<v Speaker 3>their family and they worked together and they do projects and stuff like that.</v>

5615
02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:12.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if Tony's ever been on the same stage as Chris.</v>

5616
02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:13.983
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

5617
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:15.370
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of crazy.</v>

5618
02:27:15.370 --> 02:27:15.851
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5619
02:27:15.851 --> 02:27:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he had,</v>

5620
02:27:16.691 --> 02:27:17.370
<v Speaker 3>maybe as,</v>

5621
02:27:17.370 --> 02:27:17.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

5622
02:27:17.711 --> 02:27:18.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying he hasn't,</v>

5623
02:27:18.851 --> 02:27:19.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5624
02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:21.460
<v Speaker 3>But he never,</v>

5625
02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:23.620
<v Speaker 3>he never pushed that.</v>

5626
02:27:23.621 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 3>He's Chris Rock's brother,</v>

5627
02:27:24.911 --> 02:27:25.451
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5628
02:27:25.451 --> 02:27:26.470
<v Speaker 3>he's Chris Rock's brother.</v>

5629
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:27.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5630
02:27:27.161 --> 02:27:31.120
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying that he's so good that like people almost don't take him</v>

5631
02:27:31.121 --> 02:27:34.960
<v Speaker 3>seriously because he's the brother of one of the greatest comics of all time.</v>

5632
02:27:34.990 --> 02:27:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5633
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:37.660
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't get the props is he deserves,</v>

5634
02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:38.140
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5635
02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Cause people think he's,</v>

5636
02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:42.430
<v Speaker 3>but he's not riding his brother now in any way.</v>

5637
02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:44.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like the opposite of nepotism here.</v>

5638
02:27:44.951 --> 02:27:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to suffers from it.</v>

5639
02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And so he's not Jim Belushi,</v>

5640
02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:50.050
<v Speaker 3>like Charlie Murphy,</v>

5641
02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:53.230
<v Speaker 3>like jokes around about bringing and Eddie Murphy's brother,</v>

5642
02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:53.951
<v Speaker 3>like people like,</v>

5643
02:27:53.951 --> 02:27:54.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5644
02:27:54.191 --> 02:27:55.450
<v Speaker 3>like he's like,</v>

5645
02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:55.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5646
02:27:55.871 --> 02:27:57.130
<v Speaker 3>like people would just yell at them.</v>

5647
02:27:57.131 --> 02:27:57.461
<v Speaker 3>Charlie,</v>

5648
02:27:57.461 --> 02:27:58.090
<v Speaker 3>my bay,</v>

5649
02:27:58.090 --> 02:27:59.110
<v Speaker 3>like they yell at him and he goes,</v>

5650
02:27:59.111 --> 02:28:00.040
<v Speaker 3>does that ever get tired?</v>

5651
02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.113
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

5652
02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:01.840
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5653
02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:02.231
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

5654
02:28:02.231 --> 02:28:05.560
<v Speaker 3>as long as they're not saying there's Eddie Murphy's brother,</v>

5655
02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:05.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5656
02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.200
<v Speaker 3>because for years I was just Eddie Murphy's brother.</v>

5657
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.740
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

5658
02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy when people yell out of Charlie Murphy.</v>

5659
02:28:10.751 --> 02:28:11.770
<v Speaker 3>They know my fucking name,</v>

5660
02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:13.173
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5661
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:13.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5662
02:28:13.541 --> 02:28:13.811
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

5663
02:28:13.811 --> 02:28:14.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5664
02:28:14.141 --> 02:28:19.110
<v Speaker 3>that's the price you pay when there's Famor talent like that in the family and</v>

5665
02:28:19.111 --> 02:28:22.280
<v Speaker 3>just such immense fame and talent.</v>

5666
02:28:22.290 --> 02:28:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5667
02:28:22.970 --> 02:28:23.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5668
02:28:23.151 --> 02:28:24.440
<v Speaker 3>in those two situations,</v>

5669
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock to the funniest,</v>

5670
02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:28.370
<v Speaker 3>most famous guys of all time.</v>

5671
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.900
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

5672
02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:30.410

<v Speaker 3>it was only one of those in the family,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda probably not going to be another one.</v>

5692
02:28:54.350 --> 02:28:55.183
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5693
02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Well he was definitely not doing enough coke.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5697
02:28:59.261 --> 02:29:00.200
<v Speaker 3>You want to be like Chris,</v>

5698

5700
02:29:02.511 --> 02:29:07.511
<v Speaker 3>but apparently up he was like that all his life from when he was a little kid.</v>

5701
02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I met him at the,</v>

5702
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:10.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5703
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:12.380
<v Speaker 3>backstage at the,</v>

5704
02:29:12.381 --> 02:29:13.750
<v Speaker 3>a set of news radio.</v>

5705
02:29:13.751 --> 02:29:15.770
<v Speaker 3>He was friends with Andy Dick and this is,</v>

5706
02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:16.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5707
02:29:16.041 --> 02:29:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Andy Dick was a hard partier,</v>

5708
02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:18.910
<v Speaker 3>hard harp.</v>

5709
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:19.790
<v Speaker 3>He's all sober now,</v>

5710
02:29:19.791 --> 02:29:21.710
<v Speaker 3>but he was hard partier.</v>

5711
02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Chris rock or a Chris Rock.</v>

5712
02:29:23.811 --> 02:29:28.811
<v Speaker 3>Chris Farley was there with two very hot looking young girls who look like</v>

5713
02:29:28.821 --> 02:29:30.020
<v Speaker 3>they've been up for days.</v>

5714
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 3>They were very attractive but just looked fucked up and he was gray.</v>

5715
02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:36.320
<v Speaker 3>And when I mean gray,</v>

5716
02:29:36.321 --> 02:29:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean like wet cardboard,</v>

5717
02:29:38.301 --> 02:29:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Gray.</v>

5718
02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:44.020
<v Speaker 3>He looked like he could die any second now he was sweaty and gray and pale and</v>

5719
02:29:44.331 --> 02:29:44.871
<v Speaker 3>his eyes,</v>

5720
02:29:44.871 --> 02:29:49.871
<v Speaker 3>there's like bags under his eyes and he was just on some kind of crazy bender</v>

5721
02:29:50.390 --> 02:29:54.770
<v Speaker 3>and he was there with these two girls and I had always heard that he was this</v>

5722
02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:55.850
<v Speaker 3>wild partier.</v>

5723
02:29:56.250 --> 02:29:58.040
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't long after that that he died either.</v>

5724
02:29:58.430 --> 02:29:59.360
<v Speaker 3>But I remember seeing them,</v>

5725
02:29:59.361 --> 02:29:59.960
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

5726
02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:00.441
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

5727
02:30:00.441 --> 02:30:02.570
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fucking around like this kid is really doing it.</v>

5728
02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:03.350
<v Speaker 3>But that's what,</v>

5729
02:30:03.350 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was talking about.</v>

5730
02:30:04.491 --> 02:30:05.930
<v Speaker 3>That's when it's not fun.</v>

5731
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5732
02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:07.700
<v Speaker 3>you're beyond like,</v>

5733
02:30:07.701 --> 02:30:08.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not a party.</v>

5734
02:30:09.470 --> 02:30:14.470
<v Speaker 3>And what kills guys like that is you have the unlimited money to do that.</v>

5735
02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5736
02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:17.900
<v Speaker 3>And you basically had permission to do it.</v>

5737
02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:22.960
<v Speaker 3>As long as you can make another movie or another show or another record or</v>

5738
02:30:23.061 --> 02:30:23.481
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

5739
02:30:23.481 --> 02:30:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I read Clapton's book,</v>

5740
02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:27.170
<v Speaker 3>which was actually really good.</v>

5741
02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:29.930
<v Speaker 3>And in the beginning of the book he says,</v>

5742
02:30:29.931 --> 02:30:30.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5743
02:30:30.291 --> 02:30:33.140
<v Speaker 3>with the amount of drugs and alcohol I did in my life,</v>

5744
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:34.700
<v Speaker 3>I should have been dead.</v>

5745
02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5746
02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:40.420
<v Speaker 3>And then about two thirds of the way through the book is when he sobers up and</v>

5747
02:30:40.491 --> 02:30:40.791
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

5748
02:30:40.791 --> 02:30:41.451
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

5749
02:30:41.451 --> 02:30:42.830
<v Speaker 3>how is he not dead?</v>

5750
02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Like when you read about how much he did and the quantities and the just at the,</v>

5751
02:30:48.111 --> 02:30:48.944
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

5752
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:51.410
<v Speaker 3>this guy's not human.</v>

5753
02:30:51.411 --> 02:30:51.681
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

5754
02:30:51.681 --> 02:30:51.951
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5755
02:30:51.951 --> 02:30:53.000
<v Speaker 3>you should have been dead.</v>

5756
02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5757
02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:53.781
<v Speaker 3>what was he doing?</v>

5758
02:30:53.781 --> 02:30:54.614
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

5759
02:30:54.970 --> 02:30:55.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5760
02:30:55.310 --> 02:30:55.970
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

5761
02:30:55.970 --> 02:30:56.271
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5762
02:30:56.271 --> 02:31:00.550
<v Speaker 3>and large amounts of pills and cocaine and me,</v>

5763
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:01.610
<v Speaker 3>he talks about,</v>

5764
02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:05.870
<v Speaker 3>he did one show for like 23,000 people in a total blackout.</v>

5765
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know he was there and you know,</v>

5766
02:31:09.231 --> 02:31:09.531
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5767
02:31:09.531 --> 02:31:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Just tons of pills and alcohol.</v>

5768
02:31:12.141 --> 02:31:13.310
<v Speaker 3>And how was the show?</v>

5769
02:31:13.340 --> 02:31:14.173
<v Speaker 3>They would</v>

5770
02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.550
<v Speaker 3>imagine it was pretty good,</v>

5771
02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:18.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5772
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:20.820
<v Speaker 3>take her out.</v>

5773
02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:21.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5774
02:31:21.571 --> 02:31:22.530
<v Speaker 3>That was the life though.</v>

5775
02:31:22.531 --> 02:31:24.210
<v Speaker 3>That was what those guys were embracing.</v>

5776
02:31:24.470 --> 02:31:24.910
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

5777
02:31:24.910 --> 02:31:27.390
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a generation before me.</v>

5778
02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:29.340
<v Speaker 3>There was a jazz musicians before them,</v>

5779
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:30.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5780
02:31:30.001 --> 02:31:30.361
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

5781
02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:30.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5782
02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:30.990
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

5783
02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:32.680
<v Speaker 3>the older blues guys that,</v>

5784
02:31:32.730 --> 02:31:35.760
<v Speaker 3>that fucked around with drugs and did heroin and stuff like that.</v>

5785
02:31:35.761 --> 02:31:36.630
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part,</v>

5786
02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:40.600
<v Speaker 3>those hard party and rock stars from the 60s and Seventies.</v>

5787
02:31:40.601 --> 02:31:42.540
<v Speaker 3>And it was no one was like,</v>

5788
02:31:42.930 --> 02:31:44.580
<v Speaker 3>they took it and there were new drugs,</v>

5789
02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:45.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5790
02:31:45.390 --> 02:31:46.740
<v Speaker 3>acid was new.</v>

5791
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:47.603
<v Speaker 3>Cocaine was,</v>

5792
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:48.001
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

5793
02:31:48.001 --> 02:31:51.000
<v Speaker 3>relatively new as Ellen on the consumer level.</v>

5794
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.943
<v Speaker 3>Was it really?</v>

5795
02:31:52.140 --> 02:31:52.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5796
02:31:52.471 --> 02:31:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I think cocaine had been around,</v>

5797
02:31:54.121 --> 02:31:58.680
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't a lot of people who did cocaine before the 70s.</v>

5798
02:31:58.740 --> 02:31:58.861
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5799
02:31:58.861 --> 02:32:00.300
<v Speaker 3>they would just get it from Coca Cola.</v>

5800
02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:03.210
<v Speaker 3>You wanted to get fucked up cola early days.</v>

5801
02:32:03.211 --> 02:32:04.590
<v Speaker 3>It was in Coca Cola.</v>

5802
02:32:04.591 --> 02:32:06.510
<v Speaker 3>And then you watch that show.</v>

5803
02:32:06.511 --> 02:32:07.081
<v Speaker 3>Narcos.</v>

5804
02:32:07.081 --> 02:32:07.471
<v Speaker 3>Did you see?</v>

5805
02:32:07.471 --> 02:32:07.760
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

5806
02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing about it,</v>

5807
02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:09.691
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5808
02:32:09.691 --> 02:32:10.231
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing.</v>

5809
02:32:10.231 --> 02:32:10.950
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

5810
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the middle of it now.</v>

5811
02:32:12.301 --> 02:32:13.051
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good.</v>

5812
02:32:13.051 --> 02:32:16.470
<v Speaker 3>But they said that was one of Pablos things like Pablo Escobar was like,</v>

5813
02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put coke back into cold</v>

5814
02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:22.670
<v Speaker 3>calls.</v>

5815
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Coco.</v>

5816
02:32:23.310 --> 02:32:23.431
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5817
02:32:23.431 --> 02:32:23.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5818
02:32:23.671 --> 02:32:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Coca Cola still uses cocaine for flavoring.</v>

5819
02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5820
02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:27.720
<v Speaker 3>They still use coca leaves.</v>

5821
02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:31.020
<v Speaker 3>They're like one of the biggest producers of medical cocaine.</v>

5822
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:34.200
<v Speaker 3>The same company that takes the coca leaves,</v>

5823
02:32:34.410 --> 02:32:36.150
<v Speaker 3>they extract the cocaine out of it,</v>

5824
02:32:36.151 --> 02:32:37.540
<v Speaker 3>use whatever flavor that makes.</v>

5825
02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:39.840
<v Speaker 3>That's why Coca Cola tastes better than Pepsi.</v>

5826
02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:42.170
<v Speaker 3>I had medical cocaine,</v>

5827
02:32:42.171 --> 02:32:43.320
<v Speaker 3>I had liquid cocaine.</v>

5828
02:32:43.930 --> 02:32:44.763
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5829
02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:49.940
<v Speaker 3>I cut my retina like playing ball and end it is pain.</v>

5830
02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Like you would not,</v>

5831
02:32:52.201 --> 02:32:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5832
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:53.091
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5833
02:32:53.091 --> 02:32:57.360
<v Speaker 3>it's as painful as it sounds and apparently that's what the treatment is.</v>

5834
02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Like he gave me this eyedrop and the pain went away instantly.</v>

5835
02:33:00.661 --> 02:33:00.901
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5836
02:33:00.901 --> 02:33:01.301
<v Speaker 3>what was that?</v>

5837
02:33:01.301 --> 02:33:02.134
<v Speaker 3>He said cocaine.</v>

5838
02:33:02.290 --> 02:33:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5839
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:03.511
<v Speaker 3>oh can I,</v>

5840
02:33:03.511 --> 02:33:03.901
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

5841
02:33:03.901 --> 02:33:04.081
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5842
02:33:04.081 --> 02:33:04.914
<v Speaker 3>we don't prescribe it.</v>

5843
02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:09.060
<v Speaker 3>You got to come in and we put the drop in your eye.</v>

5844
02:33:09.061 --> 02:33:09.571
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

5845
02:33:09.571 --> 02:33:10.320
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

5846
02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:11.131
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of the,</v>

5847
02:33:11.131 --> 02:33:14.400
<v Speaker 3>you know how you go to the doctor when you're hurt and you want it to stop</v>

5848
02:33:14.401 --> 02:33:15.540
<v Speaker 3>hurting right away.</v>

5849
02:33:16.050 --> 02:33:16.883
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>

5850
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Like it was one of those rare times when you go to the doctor like Yep,</v>

5851
02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.930
<v Speaker 3>that stopped the pain instantly.</v>

5852
02:33:21.931 --> 02:33:22.764
<v Speaker 3>Thank you doc.</v>

5853
02:33:23.310 --> 02:33:23.941
<v Speaker 3>But that's what,</v>

5854
02:33:23.941 --> 02:33:24.774
<v Speaker 3>that's what they use it.</v>

5855
02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it has other uses uses,</v>

5856
02:33:27.121 --> 02:33:27.660
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

5857
02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:28.860
<v Speaker 3>when I had my nose fixed,</v>

5858
02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:30.390
<v Speaker 3>they put light of keen in there,</v>

5859
02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:32.250
<v Speaker 3>which is like the gay cousin of cocaine.</v>

5860
02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Cocaine's cocaine's less talented brother</v>

5861
02:33:38.730 --> 02:33:39.510
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

5862
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:41.130
<v Speaker 3>it tastes horrible.</v>

5863
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:41.911
<v Speaker 3>It tastes fucking,</v>

5864
02:33:41.911 --> 02:33:42.960
<v Speaker 3>but it numbs everything up.</v>

5865
02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:44.360
<v Speaker 3>But all it does is now everything up.</v>

5866
02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:44.910
<v Speaker 3>You don't get,</v>

5867
02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:45.571
<v Speaker 3>you don't get sick,</v>

5868
02:33:45.571 --> 02:33:48.990
<v Speaker 3>but you do get this weird jittery feeling.</v>

5869
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I went out that night,</v>

5870
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:52.470
<v Speaker 3>I went to dinner and uh,</v>

5871
02:33:52.471 --> 02:33:53.301
<v Speaker 3>I tried to eat,</v>

5872
02:33:53.301 --> 02:33:53.790
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

5873
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't eat.</v>

5874
02:33:55.150 --> 02:33:57.690
<v Speaker 3>It was like my appetite was all fucked up and I was all,</v>

5875
02:33:57.820 --> 02:33:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

5876
02:33:58.040 --> 02:33:58.770
<v Speaker 3>I realize like,</v>

5877
02:33:58.770 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh I guess this is like the effects of that light king shit cause they'd been</v>

5878
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:05.330
<v Speaker 3>squirting up my nose and you know,</v>

5879
02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:07.830
<v Speaker 3>it's weird with drugs what people like,</v>

5880
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5881
02:34:08.341 --> 02:34:08.670
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5882
02:34:08.670 --> 02:34:09.180
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

5883
02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I went through a surgery and they gave me that morphine drip like Ooh yeah I got</v>

5884
02:34:13.141 --> 02:34:15.570
<v Speaker 3>one bus and some people love it.</v>

5885
02:34:15.571 --> 02:34:16.230
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

5886
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.891
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

5887
02:34:16.891 --> 02:34:17.950
<v Speaker 3>it would put me to sleep.</v>

5888
02:34:17.951 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

5889
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 4>I had no desire to,</v>

5890
02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:22.510
<v Speaker 4>to feel like that.</v>

5891
02:34:23.050 --> 02:34:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you're a heroin addict,</v>

5892
02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:26.980
<v Speaker 4>you want to feel like that all the time.</v>

5893
02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:30.250
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I can be a heroin addict then because I fucking loved it man.</v>

5894
02:34:30.251 --> 02:34:31.880
<v Speaker 4>I had my ACL reconstructed.</v>

5895
02:34:31.940 --> 02:34:33.430
<v Speaker 4>You'd go more that way I think.</v>

5896
02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:38.431
<v Speaker 4>Cause you're naturally so you're naturally a high energy like active person.</v>

5897
02:34:38.471 --> 02:34:38.921
<v Speaker 4>So yes.</v>

5898
02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:43.600
<v Speaker 4>So your high was probably be a slow down whereas I'm more,</v>

5899
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:43.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5900
02:34:43.961 --> 02:34:48.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm naturally slow laid back so my high was more up.</v>

5901
02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:52.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why I took the pot so well this is pot like gave me a chance to</v>

5902
02:34:52.631 --> 02:34:54.040
<v Speaker 4>slow down and look at things.</v>

5903
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:57.700
<v Speaker 4>I always felt like most of my life was always like,</v>

5904
02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:02.800
<v Speaker 4>oh just fucking go just and then can away get out of your own way.</v>

5905
02:35:03.370 --> 02:35:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Cause like the momentum of all the Shit I had done before was always like</v>

5906
02:35:07.050 --> 02:35:08.920
<v Speaker 4>knocking on my door and my keep moving.</v>

5907
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:11.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5908
02:35:11.050 --> 02:35:13.010
<v Speaker 4>no time for introspective thinking.</v>

5909
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:14.740
<v Speaker 4>No time for objectivity,</v>

5910
02:35:14.741 --> 02:35:16.000
<v Speaker 4>just fucking run.</v>

5911
02:35:16.270 --> 02:35:17.440
<v Speaker 4>And if you get success,</v>

5912
02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:17.951
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

5913
02:35:17.951 --> 02:35:21.190
<v Speaker 4>That success justifies all this behavior and motion.</v>

5914
02:35:21.191 --> 02:35:22.090
<v Speaker 4>So keep going.</v>

5915
02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.190
<v Speaker 4>And Pot was the first thing that made me go,</v>

5916
02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:26.531
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5917
02:35:26.531 --> 02:35:27.340
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

5918
02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Like what am,</v>

5919
02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:28.631
<v Speaker 4>why am I doing this?</v>

5920
02:35:28.631 --> 02:35:28.791
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

5921
02:35:28.791 --> 02:35:29.091
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

5922
02:35:29.091 --> 02:35:29.371
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

5923
02:35:29.371 --> 02:35:29.830
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

5924
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:31.270
<v Speaker 4>What is the purpose of all of this?</v>

5925
02:35:31.271 --> 02:35:31.601
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

5926
02:35:31.601 --> 02:35:32.560
<v Speaker 4>what is my path?</v>

5927
02:35:32.561 --> 02:35:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Where,</v>

5928
02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:33.410
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

5929
02:35:33.410 --> 02:35:33.671
<v Speaker 4>what do,</v>

5930
02:35:33.671 --> 02:35:34.810
<v Speaker 4>what makes me happy?</v>

5931
02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:35.740
<v Speaker 4>What do I want to do?</v>

5932
02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:36.190
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

5933
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:37.300
<v Speaker 4>What makes me unhappy?</v>

5934
02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:38.350
<v Speaker 4>How do I stop doing that?</v>

5935
02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:38.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5936
02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:40.390
<v Speaker 4>like made me think about things in a way,</v>

5937
02:35:40.391 --> 02:35:44.110
<v Speaker 4>but when I had my ACL reconstructed the first one,</v>

5938
02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:45.131
<v Speaker 4>the second one,</v>

5939
02:35:45.131 --> 02:35:46.030
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do shit.</v>

5940
02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.560
<v Speaker 4>The second one was so easy.</v>

5941
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:48.550
<v Speaker 4>I had to,</v>

5942
02:35:48.670 --> 02:35:50.980
<v Speaker 4>and I tell everybody if you have a chance,</v>

5943
02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:52.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5944
02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:53.680
<v Speaker 4>then they offer you a,</v>

5945
02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:55.190
<v Speaker 4>that is two different types of,</v>

5946
02:35:55.530 --> 02:35:56.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

5947
02:35:56.050 --> 02:35:57.240
<v Speaker 4>there's three different types of use.</v>

5948
02:35:57.240 --> 02:35:58.420
<v Speaker 4>They sometimes use hamstring,</v>

5949
02:35:58.421 --> 02:36:00.790
<v Speaker 4>which was really rough and a lot of rehab.</v>

5950
02:36:00.791 --> 02:36:00.851
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

5951
02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:01.220
<v Speaker 4>Terry,</v>

5952
02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:04.420
<v Speaker 4>they cut a chunk of your hamstring and it takes a long time for that to come</v>

5953
02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:04.841
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

5954
02:36:04.841 --> 02:36:05.920
<v Speaker 4>And some people,</v>

5955
02:36:05.921 --> 02:36:10.921
<v Speaker 4>they don't feel like it ever is 100% and they put that and they use that as a</v>

5956
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:11.830
<v Speaker 4>tendon.</v>

5957
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:13.900
<v Speaker 4>But I had the Patella tendon graft,</v>

5958
02:36:13.901 --> 02:36:18.140
<v Speaker 4>they take a piece of bone out of your shin and a piece of bone out of your knee</v>

5959
02:36:18.141 --> 02:36:22.900
<v Speaker 4>cap and then they slice the Patella tendon and it's connected with these two</v>

5960
02:36:22.901 --> 02:36:25.720
<v Speaker 4>pieces of bone and the Patella 10 is a very thick,</v>

5961
02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:29.500
<v Speaker 4>wide tendon and they use that as a replacement for your ACL.</v>

5962
02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:31.080
<v Speaker 4>I had that done in my left knee,</v>

5963
02:36:31.081 --> 02:36:33.310
<v Speaker 4>and that's the one that did the a morphine drip.</v>

5964
02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:34.121
<v Speaker 4>The right knee,</v>

5965
02:36:34.121 --> 02:36:35.560
<v Speaker 4>they used a cadaver.</v>

5966
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:37.120
<v Speaker 4>They use an achilles tendon,</v>

5967
02:36:37.121 --> 02:36:42.010
<v Speaker 4>so it's much thicker than an ACL and it's like a 150% stronger and they use</v>

5968
02:36:42.011 --> 02:36:42.220
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

5969
02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:42.971
<v Speaker 4>They screw that in place.</v>

5970
02:36:42.971 --> 02:36:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I went to a party five days later,</v>

5971
02:36:44.771 --> 02:36:46.300
<v Speaker 4>I was walking around without crutches.</v>

5972
02:36:46.301 --> 02:36:46.631
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

5973
02:36:46.631 --> 02:36:47.590
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

5974
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:48.910
<v Speaker 4>It was so much better.</v>

5975
02:36:49.210 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 4>But the first one,</v>

5976
02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:54.490
<v Speaker 4>the Patella tendon was like fire was gone through my veins.</v>

5977
02:36:54.491 --> 02:36:57.240
<v Speaker 4>It was like I would get up off the couch and uh,</v>

5978
02:36:57.250 --> 02:36:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like take pain pills.</v>

5979
02:36:59.650 --> 02:37:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I hated the way those made me feel.</v>

5980
02:37:01.450 --> 02:37:02.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what it was,</v>

5981
02:37:02.471 --> 02:37:03.760
<v Speaker 4>percocets or Vicodins,</v>

5982
02:37:03.761 --> 02:37:04.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember which one it was,</v>

5983
02:37:04.721 --> 02:37:07.930
<v Speaker 4>but I remember I sold them to this due to the pool hall because I was like,</v>

5984
02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:09.880
<v Speaker 4>these are fucking bullshit.</v>

5985
02:37:09.881 --> 02:37:10.714
<v Speaker 4>I hate that.</v>

5986
02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:13.270
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather be in pain than be that stupid.</v>

5987
02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:13.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5988
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:17.920
<v Speaker 4>But the trip at the hospital was like being a,</v>

5989
02:37:18.350 --> 02:37:21.080
<v Speaker 4>it was like having your balls cradled by angels.</v>

5990
02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:24.560
<v Speaker 4>It was just like you were being hugged by God.</v>

5991
02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:27.630
<v Speaker 4>It was like the world was just giving you this big warm hug.</v>

5992
02:37:27.631 --> 02:37:29.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything's gonna be fine.</v>

5993
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:33.560
<v Speaker 4>I was on this machine that constantly straightened my leg and bent.</v>

5994
02:37:33.561 --> 02:37:38.090
<v Speaker 4>It is like this constant motion machine because they're trying to keep your leg</v>

5995
02:37:38.091 --> 02:37:39.800
<v Speaker 4>from going stiff after they,</v>

5996
02:37:39.801 --> 02:37:40.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5997
02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:43.820
<v Speaker 4>fucking chisel into it and start script putting screws in and all that.</v>

5998
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:45.080
<v Speaker 4>So this machine is going</v>

5999
02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.160
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going click</v>

6000
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:54.290
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just melting into this fucking bed.</v>

6001
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:57.080
<v Speaker 4>And the last time I had that feeling was,</v>

6002
02:37:57.081 --> 02:37:57.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6003
02:37:57.410 --> 02:37:58.191
<v Speaker 4>in the early,</v>

6004
02:37:58.191 --> 02:37:58.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6005
02:37:58.580 --> 02:37:59.630
<v Speaker 4>maybe the late nineties,</v>

6006
02:37:59.631 --> 02:38:00.464
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was.</v>

6007
02:38:00.810 --> 02:38:01.820
<v Speaker 4>It must've been the late nineties.</v>

6008
02:38:01.821 --> 02:38:02.230
<v Speaker 4>Cause I,</v>

6009
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.481
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

6010
02:38:02.481 --> 02:38:03.314
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6011
02:38:03.650 --> 02:38:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I remember I lived out here and I got ahold of some of the real nyquil before</v>

6012
02:38:08.841 --> 02:38:10.370
<v Speaker 4>they took that shit off the market.</v>

6013
02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:12.330
<v Speaker 4>The alcohol with the coding in it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

6016
02:38:14.211 --> 02:38:17.860
<v Speaker 4>It was 25 proof with coding or something.</v>

6017
02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6018
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:19.490
<v Speaker 4>it was so good.</v>

6019
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:20.470
<v Speaker 4>It was so good.</v>

6020
02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:21.650

02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:31.640
<v Speaker 4>the the people that worked at the Comedy Club at Rascals in New Jersey.</v>

6026
02:38:31.641 --> 02:38:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I go to rascals.</v>

6027
02:38:32.511 --> 02:38:35.780
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to bring bottles of fucking Nyquil and they would always just talk</v>

6028
02:38:35.781 --> 02:38:36.111
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

6029
02:38:36.111 --> 02:38:36.291
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6030
02:38:36.291 --> 02:38:38.060
<v Speaker 4>He fucking wants bottles of Nyquil.</v>

6031
02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:39.330
<v Speaker 4>It just drinks nyquil.</v>

6032
02:38:39.370 --> 02:38:40.780
<v Speaker 4>It goes into his hotel room and drinks.</v>

6033
02:38:40.810 --> 02:38:41.330
<v Speaker 4>NYQUIL.</v>

6034
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:41.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6035
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:45.620
<v Speaker 4>My knees have no cartilage like that's just beat up.</v>

6036
02:38:45.621 --> 02:38:47.420
<v Speaker 4>So when they hurt my doctor's like,</v>

6037
02:38:47.421 --> 02:38:47.571
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6038
02:38:47.571 --> 02:38:48.470
<v Speaker 4>we're going to replace them.</v>

6039
02:38:48.471 --> 02:38:49.041
<v Speaker 4>We just wait.</v>

6040
02:38:49.041 --> 02:38:49.460
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

6041
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:49.821
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

6042
02:38:49.821 --> 02:38:50.480
<v Speaker 4>don't listen.</v>

6043
02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:52.190
<v Speaker 4>If that's all it is is just cartilage.</v>

6044
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:53.780
<v Speaker 4>You got to get stem cells.</v>

6045
02:38:53.870 --> 02:38:54.800
<v Speaker 4>Stem cell shots.</v>

6046
02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:55.671
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

6047
02:38:55.671 --> 02:38:56.001
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

6048
02:38:56.001 --> 02:38:57.200
<v Speaker 4>It's the greatest thing of all time.</v>

6049
02:38:57.470 --> 02:38:59.120
<v Speaker 4>They actually regenerate tissue.</v>

6050
02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:00.800
<v Speaker 4>They can regenerate meniscus,</v>

6051
02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:03.770
<v Speaker 4>regenerate cartilage and bone on bone situations.</v>

6052
02:39:04.010 --> 02:39:05.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll hook you up with his doctor.</v>

6053
02:39:05.181 --> 02:39:06.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll go get you connected to him there.</v>

6054
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:09.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just over the last couple of years they're doing these things.</v>

6055
02:39:09.351 --> 02:39:12.880
<v Speaker 4>They're having a miraculous results with stem cells dies and someone was,</v>

6056
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:15.610
<v Speaker 4>someone online complained to me on Twitter though.</v>

6057
02:39:15.611 --> 02:39:16.040
<v Speaker 4>They're good.</v>

6058
02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:17.780
<v Speaker 4>Go load of people can't afford themselves.</v>

6059
02:39:18.050 --> 02:39:19.310
<v Speaker 4>What do you want me to not talk about it?</v>

6060
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Should I not talk about how awesome it is because people can't afford it.</v>

6061
02:39:22.311 --> 02:39:23.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the way our,</v>

6062
02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:23.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6063
02:39:23.961 --> 02:39:24.711
<v Speaker 4>medicine is,</v>

6064
02:39:24.711 --> 02:39:25.140
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

6065
02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:25.640
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

6066
02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:26.001
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

6067
02:39:26.001 --> 02:39:28.160
<v Speaker 4>It's annoying to you that you can't afford it,</v>

6068
02:39:28.161 --> 02:39:30.380
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not going to not talk.</v>

6069
02:39:30.381 --> 02:39:31.520
<v Speaker 4>I had it in my shoulder.</v>

6070
02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:33.380
<v Speaker 4>I had that stem cell shot in my shoulder.</v>

6071
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:35.900
<v Speaker 4>I was like probably a couple months away from surgery.</v>

6072
02:39:35.901 --> 02:39:36.734
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

6073
02:39:37.130 --> 02:39:40.190
<v Speaker 4>just trying to figure out when I could schedule it because just it was so</v>

6074
02:39:40.191 --> 02:39:40.580
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>

6075
02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Every time I'd work out it'd be in pain for a few days and then I would do it</v>

6076
02:39:43.581 --> 02:39:47.090
<v Speaker 4>again and ice it and all this different shit and I was like,</v>

6077
02:39:47.091 --> 02:39:49.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to fucking bite the bullet and get this thing fixed.</v>

6078
02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:50.840
<v Speaker 4>One stem cell shot,</v>

6079
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.711
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

6080
02:39:51.711 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Within two weeks it feels a hundred percent better,</v>

6081
02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:56.750
<v Speaker 4>but other than a month it felt better than I've felt in a year.</v>

6082
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:58.010
<v Speaker 4>And now it's like,</v>

6083
02:39:58.280 --> 02:39:59.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean occasionally it's,</v>

6084
02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:00.050
<v Speaker 4>it's sore.</v>

6085
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Like yesterday I lifted and I lifted this morning and he's kind of a little</v>

6086
02:40:03.711 --> 02:40:04.131
<v Speaker 4>sore,</v>

6087
02:40:04.131 --> 02:40:05.650
<v Speaker 4>but nothing to complain about.</v>

6088
02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:06.830
<v Speaker 4>No big deal.</v>

6089
02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:11.180
<v Speaker 4>It's funny when you're talking about how they take part of the shin bone and the</v>

6090
02:40:11.181 --> 02:40:12.014
<v Speaker 4>other bone to put it.</v>

6091
02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6092
02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:13.800
<v Speaker 4>when doctors do shit like that,</v>

6093
02:40:13.801 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

6094
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:15.390
<v Speaker 3>how smart are you?</v>

6095
02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean like that,</v>

6096
02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:17.970

6097
02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:18.803
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

6098
02:40:18.810 --> 02:40:20.730
<v Speaker 3>you can actually do that.</v>

6099
02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:21.241
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6100
02:40:21.241 --> 02:40:24.500
<v Speaker 3>like I shattered my wrist and the doc,</v>

6101
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:26.810
<v Speaker 3>I got to know the doctor who first I could crash.</v>

6102
02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6103
02:40:27.410 --> 02:40:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I know it on a race track.</v>

6104
02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:29.181
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

6105
02:40:29.181 --> 02:40:29.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6106
02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:30.900
<v Speaker 3>not ordinary circumstance,</v>

6107
02:40:30.930 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 3>but I was talking to the doctor and you know,</v>

6108
02:40:34.051 --> 02:40:36.420
<v Speaker 3>and we become friends over time.</v>

6109
02:40:36.421 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

6110
02:40:36.690 --> 02:40:37.830
<v Speaker 3>I fuck with him about it.</v>

6111
02:40:37.831 --> 02:40:38.670
<v Speaker 3>He fucks with me.</v>

6112
02:40:39.130 --> 02:40:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Like when he,</v>

6113
02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:42.480
<v Speaker 3>when he did the surgery and he said he'll do it again.</v>

6114
02:40:42.481 --> 02:40:42.691
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6115
02:40:42.691 --> 02:40:42.841
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6116
02:40:42.841 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't get shit right the first time.</v>

6117
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:45.151
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

6118
02:40:45.151 --> 02:40:45.361
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6119
02:40:45.361 --> 02:40:47.040
<v Speaker 3>if you hadn't fucked it up so bad,</v>

6120
02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:47.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6121
02:40:47.581 --> 02:40:48.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like that kind of,</v>

6122
02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:49.220
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

6123
02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:50.580
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes I just looked at him like,</v>

6124
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:52.110
<v Speaker 3>how smart are you?</v>

6125
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Could you just put bodies back together?</v>

6126
02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:56.400
<v Speaker 3>His shit is amazing.</v>

6127
02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:57.091
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

6128
02:40:57.091 --> 02:40:57.490
<v Speaker 3>well you,</v>

6129
02:40:57.490 --> 02:40:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I tell fucking Dick joke,</v>

6130
02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:03.450
<v Speaker 3>you go inside the human body and repair it.</v>

6131
02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:04.530
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly amazing.</v>

6132
02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Different kinds of smart.</v>

6133
02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:07.410
<v Speaker 3>How about that Ben Carson Guy,</v>

6134
02:41:07.411 --> 02:41:08.700
<v Speaker 3>that guy that runs for president,</v>

6135
02:41:08.850 --> 02:41:13.850
<v Speaker 3>how was a neurosurgeon that he fixed conjoined twins at the head and yet you'd</v>

6136
02:41:15.101 --> 02:41:16.080
<v Speaker 3>listened to him talk,</v>

6137
02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:20.670
<v Speaker 3>now you talk about the disconnect that I honestly,</v>

6138
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:24.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not like Herman Cain cause obviously I make fun of all these guys and the</v>

6139
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:29.430
<v Speaker 3>black Republican is always going to be hilarious because it's like everyone else</v>

6140
02:41:29.431 --> 02:41:29.880
<v Speaker 3>knows,</v>

6141
02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.770
<v Speaker 3>nobody told you.</v>

6142
02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:37.280
<v Speaker 3>But to be that smart and yet when you listen to some of his political stuff,</v>

6143
02:41:37.981 --> 02:41:38.814
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

6144
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:40.230
<v Speaker 3>how does that work?</v>

6145
02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:43.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that because you're in neurosis and you're not just a</v>

6146
02:41:43.561 --> 02:41:44.281
<v Speaker 3>neurosurgeon.</v>

6147
02:41:44.281 --> 02:41:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you worked your way up from nowhere.</v>

6148
02:41:47.311 --> 02:41:49.230
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like you were born into,</v>

6149
02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:49.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6150
02:41:49.710 --> 02:41:52.180
<v Speaker 3>a silver spoon in your mouth or whatever light.</v>

6151
02:41:52.181 --> 02:41:53.280
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

6152
02:41:53.281 --> 02:41:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

6153
02:41:53.730 --> 02:41:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand Ben Carson at all.</v>

6154
02:41:56.610 --> 02:41:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6155
02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:58.560
<v Speaker 3>it's hard when you start,</v>

6156
02:41:58.561 --> 02:42:00.060
<v Speaker 3>when he starts talking about religion,</v>

6157
02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:01.380
<v Speaker 3>when he starts talking about,</v>

6158
02:42:01.381 --> 02:42:01.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6159
02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:05.670
<v Speaker 3>the Big Bang and evolution is a myth and the big bang is bullshit.</v>

6160
02:42:05.730 --> 02:42:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't believe in evolution,</v>

6161
02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:07.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6162
02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:10.320
<v Speaker 3>He mean he might think the earth is 10,000 years old.</v>

6163
02:42:10.321 --> 02:42:11.280
<v Speaker 3>He had been one of those guys.</v>

6164
02:42:11.281 --> 02:42:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6165
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:12.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6166
02:42:12.211 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 3>He's got some really wacky ideas,</v>

6167
02:42:13.921 --> 02:42:16.200
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to fixing a brain,</v>

6168
02:42:16.201 --> 02:42:17.580
<v Speaker 3>he knows what the fuck to do.</v>

6169
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:17.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6170
02:42:17.911 --> 02:42:19.020
<v Speaker 3>And but that's what I mean.</v>

6171
02:42:19.021 --> 02:42:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you put those two together like in the course of learning to fix a</v>

6172
02:42:22.441 --> 02:42:23.274
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

6173
02:42:24.690 --> 02:42:26.850
<v Speaker 3>didn't they teach you any other science?</v>

6174
02:42:26.851 --> 02:42:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't there any other science classes you went to when you doesn't buy it?</v>

6175
02:42:31.470 --> 02:42:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Not to buy it?</v>

6176
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:33.211
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

6177
02:42:33.211 --> 02:42:33.411
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6178
02:42:33.411 --> 02:42:34.244
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's,</v>

6179
02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:37.920
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like the Hubris that you have to have to be so confident that you</v>

6180
02:42:37.921 --> 02:42:39.200
<v Speaker 3>could fix conjoined twins.</v>

6181
02:42:39.210 --> 02:42:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Cause apparently conjoined twins at the head is like one of the most dangerous.</v>

6182
02:42:43.850 --> 02:42:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh absolutely.</v>

6183
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:46.560
<v Speaker 3>It took more than 20 hours.</v>

6184
02:42:46.561 --> 02:42:48.990
<v Speaker 3>They brought in surgeons from all over the world to assist him,</v>

6185
02:42:49.350 --> 02:42:50.910
<v Speaker 3>but he figured out a way to,</v>

6186
02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:55.680
<v Speaker 3>they shared one artery between like a major artery between the two brains and he</v>

6187
02:42:55.681 --> 02:42:59.130
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way to channel it and make it work.</v>

6188
02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:01.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's two votes he's going to get.</v>

6189
02:43:04.170 --> 02:43:05.430
<v Speaker 3>He's ahead of Trump now.</v>

6190
02:43:05.490 --> 02:43:05.851
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6191
02:43:05.851 --> 02:43:08.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what's really crazy and the most recent polls,</v>

6192
02:43:08.161 --> 02:43:08.994
<v Speaker 3>he's ahead of Trump.</v>

6193
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:10.230
<v Speaker 3>That's because this is the,</v>

6194
02:43:10.231 --> 02:43:12.130
<v Speaker 3>this is the reality show portion</v>

6195
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:15.010
<v Speaker 2>and then next year they get to the real election.</v>

6196
02:43:15.011 --> 02:43:15.590
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6197
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Next years when they're next to you is when the real candidates,</v>

6198
02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:22.630
<v Speaker 2>do you think that's why Trump is so gung ho already knows it's bullshit.</v>

6199
02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I know Trump's going to sell books and get a TV show or whatever.</v>

6200
02:43:26.770 --> 02:43:27.311
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6201
02:43:27.311 --> 02:43:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Like this is all publicity for Trump.</v>

6202
02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:30.420
<v Speaker 2>My theory.</v>

6203
02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:30.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6204
02:43:30.701 --> 02:43:34.840
<v Speaker 2>My theory is that around December or January,</v>

6205
02:43:34.841 --> 02:43:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Trump comes up with a way to back out like,</v>

6206
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to work with these politicians are,</v>

6207
02:43:39.971 --> 02:43:40.570
<v Speaker 2>this is bull.</v>

6208
02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:41.141
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6209
02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:42.790
<v Speaker 2>He comes up with something like that.</v>

6210
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was running for governor and he backs out of it and then he rides</v>

6211
02:43:48.161 --> 02:43:50.020
<v Speaker 2>the wave of the publicity.</v>

6212
02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:53.110
<v Speaker 2>He might be right or president Trump,</v>

6213
02:43:53.170 --> 02:43:54.070
<v Speaker 2>what have you fucking wins?</v>

6214
02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:55.270
<v Speaker 2>What if he gets in there?</v>

6215
02:43:55.330 --> 02:43:55.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6216
02:43:55.691 --> 02:43:57.370
<v Speaker 2>would that be the biggest,</v>

6217
02:43:57.371 --> 02:43:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I just can't see it happening.</v>

6218
02:43:59.350 --> 02:44:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

6219
02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Because for one thing,</v>

6220
02:44:02.201 --> 02:44:06.970
<v Speaker 2>he knows nothing about policy or how government works or you know,</v>

6221
02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:09.040
<v Speaker 2>but how hard is that to learn?</v>

6222
02:44:09.730 --> 02:44:09.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6223
02:44:09.911 --> 02:44:12.250
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard on them on that level.</v>

6224
02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Even like even Barack Obama who went in knowing it,</v>

6225
02:44:16.451 --> 02:44:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I think like his first two years in office was an education.</v>

6226
02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Because I think you,</v>

6227
02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:26.590
<v Speaker 2>when you really find out how hard it is to make this work and to get these</v>

6228
02:44:26.591 --> 02:44:29.800
<v Speaker 2>people to work together and to get anything done,</v>

6229
02:44:29.801 --> 02:44:30.461
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

6230
02:44:30.461 --> 02:44:31.294
<v Speaker 2>Like I think,</v>

6231
02:44:32.170 --> 02:44:37.170
<v Speaker 2>I think he learned a lot about like how to try to make politics work.</v>

6232
02:44:38.441 --> 02:44:39.850
<v Speaker 2>How did you get anything done?</v>

6233
02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And Trump,</v>

6234
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Trump is more like,</v>

6235
02:44:42.990 --> 02:44:43.990
<v Speaker 2>like Schwartz Nigga,</v>

6236
02:44:43.991 --> 02:44:47.950
<v Speaker 2>when Schwarzenegger thought he was going to go in and call the legislature girly</v>

6237
02:44:47.951 --> 02:44:52.600
<v Speaker 2>men and be the terminator and they were like Fuck Outta here.</v>

6238
02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Like he had like,</v>

6239
02:44:53.711 --> 02:44:54.850
<v Speaker 2>he got slapped,</v>

6240
02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:55.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6241
02:44:55.211 --> 02:44:56.830
<v Speaker 2>and it would be the same thing with Trump.</v>

6242
02:44:56.831 --> 02:44:57.041
<v Speaker 2>They'd be,</v>

6243
02:44:57.041 --> 02:44:58.270
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean you're fired?</v>

6244
02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:00.933
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>

6245
02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6246
02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:02.321
<v Speaker 2>this is being,</v>

6247
02:45:02.321 --> 02:45:06.340
<v Speaker 2>that Trump would probably make a big deal out of explaining where all these</v>

6248
02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:07.570
<v Speaker 2>bottlenecks are.</v>

6249
02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:10.530
<v Speaker 2>He'll probably make a big deal about explaining to the public,</v>

6250
02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:12.670
<v Speaker 2>doing press conferences and not playing ball.</v>

6251
02:45:12.890 --> 02:45:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6252
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.751
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

6253
02:45:13.751 --> 02:45:14.470
<v Speaker 2>can rich,</v>

6254
02:45:14.470 --> 02:45:15.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's no,</v>

6255
02:45:15.220 --> 02:45:16.420
<v Speaker 2>that's no secret though.</v>

6256
02:45:16.421 --> 02:45:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows that,</v>

6257
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:18.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6258
02:45:18.371 --> 02:45:19.610
<v Speaker 2>we all know about party,</v>

6259
02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6260
02:45:20.591 --> 02:45:21.131
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

6261
02:45:21.131 --> 02:45:21.964
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6262
02:45:22.090 --> 02:45:22.923
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6263
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:28.660
<v Speaker 2>and to get in with all the back door deals and stuff like that,</v>

6264
02:45:28.661 --> 02:45:29.380
<v Speaker 2>like you got,</v>

6265
02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:30.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6266
02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you got to have some serious backing.</v>

6267
02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:33.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6268
02:45:33.641 --> 02:45:35.080
<v Speaker 2>like he has a lot of money,</v>

6269
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:40.110
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have Koch brothers money or what's that guy who owns the casinos</v>

6270
02:45:40.331 --> 02:45:41.380
<v Speaker 2>in Vegas?</v>

6271
02:45:41.470 --> 02:45:42.303
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6272
02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6273
02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know his name.</v>

6274
02:45:44.261 --> 02:45:46.510
<v Speaker 2>He owns a Venetian and stuff like,</v>

6275
02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:46.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6276
02:45:46.930 --> 02:45:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say his name sounds like candy man.</v>

6277
02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:52.390
<v Speaker 2>You want to say that's too much money or these or,</v>

6278
02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:53.051
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

6279
02:45:53.051 --> 02:45:55.150
<v Speaker 2>on the Democrat side they have some people,</v>

6280
02:45:55.151 --> 02:45:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got,</v>

6281
02:45:55.810 --> 02:45:56.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6282
02:45:56.141 --> 02:45:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Spielberg and Geffin and all of that.</v>

6283
02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Like Trump has money,</v>

6284
02:45:59.711 --> 02:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have their money,</v>

6285
02:46:00.850 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 2>nor does he have their influence.</v>

6286
02:46:03.430 --> 02:46:03.790
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

6287
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:08.790
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have their influence when it comes to the media and when it comes to</v>

6288
02:46:09.681 --> 02:46:10.280
<v Speaker 2>everything</v>

6289
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:11.113
<v Speaker 3>else involved.</v>

6290
02:46:11.270 --> 02:46:11.481
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6291
02:46:11.481 --> 02:46:12.320
<v Speaker 3>what's annoying to me,</v>

6292
02:46:12.350 --> 02:46:15.980
<v Speaker 3>how many women that want to vote for Hillary just because she's a woman and I'd</v>

6293
02:46:15.981 --> 02:46:18.680
<v Speaker 3>like to know how much shady shit is going on with her.</v>

6294
02:46:18.681 --> 02:46:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had these conversations like I'll vote for,</v>

6295
02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I want a woman in office,</v>

6296
02:46:22.251 --> 02:46:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

6297
02:46:22.490 --> 02:46:23.323
<v Speaker 3>but do you under,</v>

6298
02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:25.460
<v Speaker 3>do you know how shady she is?</v>

6299
02:46:25.461 --> 02:46:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that when she was a criminal lawyer,</v>

6300
02:46:27.330 --> 02:46:27.670
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

6301
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6302
02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:28.910
<v Speaker 3>she was a defense lawyer.</v>

6303
02:46:28.911 --> 02:46:31.940
<v Speaker 3>She got some guy off for raping a kid.</v>

6304
02:46:32.090 --> 02:46:32.781
<v Speaker 3>There was like some,</v>

6305
02:46:32.781 --> 02:46:37.781
<v Speaker 3>there's like a video or a recording of her joking around about it from like the</v>

6306
02:46:37.821 --> 02:46:39.940
<v Speaker 3>1980s or whatever the fuck it was when,</v>

6307
02:46:39.941 --> 02:46:40.774
<v Speaker 3>when this happened,</v>

6308
02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:42.980
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be a politician,</v>

6309
02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:44.353
<v Speaker 3>your bed,</v>

6310
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:45.171
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

6311
02:46:45.171 --> 02:46:45.621
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

6312
02:46:45.621 --> 02:46:46.454
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

6313
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:48.230
<v Speaker 3>but even before she was a politician,</v>

6314
02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:53.740
<v Speaker 3>the way either email and even then she was in it because bill has been in it</v>

6315
02:46:53.961 --> 02:46:54.740
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning.</v>

6316
02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6317
02:46:55.310 --> 02:46:55.870
<v Speaker 3>The thing I,</v>

6318
02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:59.750
<v Speaker 3>the thing I like about Hillary is she knows how the game's played.</v>

6319
02:46:59.751 --> 02:47:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Like she has experienced and she's very smart.</v>

6320
02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:03.791
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

6321
02:47:03.791 --> 02:47:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I give her that.</v>

6322
02:47:04.701 --> 02:47:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Is she per,</v>

6323
02:47:05.390 --> 02:47:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's perfect.</v>

6324
02:47:06.591 --> 02:47:08.630
<v Speaker 3>I think she's the best of them.</v>

6325
02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Of the ones who run it.</v>

6326
02:47:10.131 --> 02:47:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I think she's the best.</v>

6327
02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:12.073
<v Speaker 3>She scares me.</v>

6328
02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:14.180
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about Bernie Sanders,</v>

6329
02:47:14.181 --> 02:47:16.310
<v Speaker 3>although I like a lot of what he says,</v>

6330
02:47:16.970 --> 02:47:18.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to get done.</v>

6331
02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

6332
02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:20.473
<v Speaker 3>what particular,</v>

6333
02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:21.500
<v Speaker 3>what about the taxes?</v>

6334
02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:23.180
<v Speaker 3>He talks crazy about tax,</v>

6335
02:47:23.181 --> 02:47:25.730
<v Speaker 3>about 12 fucking shit out of Richmond.</v>

6336
02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Well he wants to do,</v>

6337
02:47:27.501 --> 02:47:30.950
<v Speaker 3>he wants to do what some other countries do with the government provides a lot</v>

6338
02:47:30.951 --> 02:47:31.970
<v Speaker 3>more services,</v>

6339
02:47:32.450 --> 02:47:34.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's paid for by a lot more taxes.</v>

6340
02:47:35.210 --> 02:47:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6341
02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:36.201
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

6342
02:47:36.201 --> 02:47:40.940
<v Speaker 3>so now you're going to have to somehow get that rich 1% that ain't paying to</v>

6343
02:47:40.941 --> 02:47:45.941
<v Speaker 3>suddenly be willing to pay and to make college free.</v>

6344
02:47:47.870 --> 02:47:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Sounds good.</v>

6345
02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:51.440
<v Speaker 3>But now you're talking about chain.</v>

6346
02:47:51.470 --> 02:47:51.891
<v Speaker 3>See it.</v>

6347
02:47:51.891 --> 02:47:55.010
<v Speaker 3>When you start talking about changing an entire system,</v>

6348
02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.540
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about cutting money out of defense to pay for things.</v>

6349
02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:00.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6350
02:48:00.051 --> 02:48:00.950
<v Speaker 3>it sounds great.</v>

6351
02:48:00.951 --> 02:48:02.390
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is this.</v>

6352
02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:07.450
<v Speaker 3>This has been this deaf military industrial defense complex business that said</v>

6353
02:48:08.991 --> 02:48:13.280
<v Speaker 3>like how many military bases that we have where it's just welfare for the town.</v>

6354
02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:15.170
<v Speaker 3>They don't need the base,</v>

6355
02:48:15.171 --> 02:48:17.090
<v Speaker 3>but the base is there cause the base employees,</v>

6356
02:48:17.091 --> 02:48:19.460
<v Speaker 3>everyone in the town and if you shut down to base,</v>

6357
02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:20.930
<v Speaker 3>the town goes broke.</v>

6358
02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's true all across America.</v>

6359
02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And then you have an,</v>

6360
02:48:24.261 --> 02:48:28.640
<v Speaker 3>the congressmen from that town will fight to the death like that.</v>

6361
02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:32.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a a naval base in West Virginia.</v>

6362
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:36.200
<v Speaker 3>What's in the ocean?</v>

6363
02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:37.063
<v Speaker 3>There's no ocean.</v>

6364
02:48:38.090 --> 02:48:39.980
<v Speaker 3>But they had this congressmen,</v>

6365
02:48:39.981 --> 02:48:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name,</v>

6366
02:48:41.001 --> 02:48:41.900
<v Speaker 3>but he was like,</v>

6367
02:48:41.930 --> 02:48:42.890
<v Speaker 3>that was his thing.</v>

6368
02:48:42.891 --> 02:48:43.970
<v Speaker 3>He was that guy.</v>

6369
02:48:43.971 --> 02:48:44.804
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

6370
02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting these jobs and this money to my district.</v>

6371
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.821
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

6372
02:48:49.821 --> 02:48:50.151
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

6373
02:48:50.151 --> 02:48:52.010
<v Speaker 3>so when you get a Bernie Sanders,</v>

6374
02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:53.810
<v Speaker 3>when you get someone who's talking about,</v>

6375
02:48:53.811 --> 02:48:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to change the whole system.</v>

6376
02:48:55.461 --> 02:48:59.750
<v Speaker 3>And I think this was a thing with Barack when Barack Obama ran initially and it</v>

6377
02:48:59.751 --> 02:49:03.890
<v Speaker 3>was about hope and change and a bunch of young people college age got on board</v>

6378
02:49:03.891 --> 02:49:07.680
<v Speaker 3>and they wanted everything to change and it was great and I think he really</v>

6379
02:49:07.681 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 3>meant</v>

6380
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:08.993
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

6381
02:49:09.210 --> 02:49:10.920
<v Speaker 2>And then he got there and it was like,</v>

6382
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:11.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6383
02:49:11.131 --> 02:49:12.180
<v Speaker 2>this ain't going to get done.</v>

6384
02:49:12.210 --> 02:49:12.721
<v Speaker 2>Because he,</v>

6385
02:49:12.721 --> 02:49:15.390
<v Speaker 2>when he got there and he had a democratic congress,</v>

6386
02:49:15.391 --> 02:49:18.300
<v Speaker 2>like if there was any chance of him doing it,</v>

6387
02:49:18.301 --> 02:49:19.930
<v Speaker 2>it was when he had the,</v>

6388
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:22.830
<v Speaker 2>the president and the Congress from the same party.</v>

6389
02:49:22.831 --> 02:49:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And even then congress was like,</v>

6390
02:49:24.571 --> 02:49:25.021
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

6391
02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:26.340
<v Speaker 2>we ain't changing that shit.</v>

6392
02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:26.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6393
02:49:26.850 --> 02:49:28.170
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to mess with that.</v>

6394
02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:29.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like they say,</v>

6395
02:49:29.581 --> 02:49:33.030
<v Speaker 2>moving to the United States is like turning an aircraft carrier.</v>

6396
02:49:34.310 --> 02:49:34.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6397
02:49:34.810 --> 02:49:35.420
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

6398
02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:36.151
<v Speaker 2>it turns,</v>

6399
02:49:36.151 --> 02:49:37.710
<v Speaker 2>but it takes a long time.</v>

6400
02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:39.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing I really love about Bernie Sanders,</v>

6401
02:49:39.691 --> 02:49:41.040
<v Speaker 2>the idea of free college.</v>

6402
02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea that these kids come out of college and they're,</v>

6403
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:47.490
<v Speaker 2>oh hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans and they're fucked.</v>

6404
02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And then I just drives me crazy.</v>

6405
02:49:50.010 --> 02:49:52.540
<v Speaker 2>It makes so much sense that you're,</v>

6406
02:49:52.541 --> 02:49:55.650
<v Speaker 2>you're almost baffled that why we don't do it.</v>

6407
02:49:55.970 --> 02:49:57.270
<v Speaker 2>There was one state,</v>

6408
02:49:57.271 --> 02:50:01.170
<v Speaker 2>and I want to say it was Iowa one say it was Iowa and,</v>

6409
02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.510
<v Speaker 2>and I only know about this because a friend of mine,</v>

6410
02:50:03.511 --> 02:50:08.340
<v Speaker 2>her kid was in school at the time and she was divorced and her husband lived</v>

6411
02:50:08.341 --> 02:50:09.174
<v Speaker 2>there and,</v>

6412
02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:10.410
<v Speaker 2>but they had this deal.</v>

6413
02:50:10.411 --> 02:50:14.820
<v Speaker 2>They said the first 10 cents of every tax dollar goes to the schools and you</v>

6414
02:50:14.821 --> 02:50:15.900
<v Speaker 2>can't mess with that.</v>

6415
02:50:15.901 --> 02:50:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't change it.</v>

6416
02:50:17.791 --> 02:50:18.270
<v Speaker 2>You can't be.</v>

6417
02:50:18.270 --> 02:50:19.920
<v Speaker 2>And what they noticed,</v>

6418
02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:20.970
<v Speaker 2>they didn't plan it,</v>

6419
02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:21.751
<v Speaker 2>but about seven,</v>

6420
02:50:21.751 --> 02:50:22.584
<v Speaker 2>eight years later,</v>

6421
02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:25.080
<v Speaker 2>their jail population started dropping.</v>

6422
02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6423
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6424
02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:28.021
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

6425
02:50:28.021 --> 02:50:29.550
<v Speaker 2>I could have kids go to school,</v>

6426
02:50:29.940 --> 02:50:30.900
<v Speaker 2>they don't go to jail,</v>

6427
02:50:30.930 --> 02:50:31.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6428
02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:36.321
<v Speaker 2>and you look at the cost of putting a guy in jail for one year versus putting</v>

6429
02:50:36.331 --> 02:50:37.860
<v Speaker 2>them in college for a year.</v>

6430
02:50:38.430 --> 02:50:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It just makes so much more sense.</v>

6431
02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention the fact that it how,</v>

6432
02:50:42.370 --> 02:50:46.800
<v Speaker 2>how is an educated populace bad other than the fact you can't control it.</v>

6433
02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the only negative to,</v>

6434
02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:50.640
<v Speaker 2>to educating people.</v>

6435
02:50:50.641 --> 02:50:51.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't control them.</v>

6436
02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:52.221
<v Speaker 4>Well that,</v>

6437
02:50:52.221 --> 02:50:55.610
<v Speaker 4>and if you do have an educated populace that's in debt,</v>

6438
02:50:55.970 --> 02:50:58.220
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to work three and a have to work and they're going to have</v>

6439
02:50:58.221 --> 02:51:02.600
<v Speaker 4>to keep your fucking mouth shut and stay inside the boundaries of the system.</v>

6440
02:51:02.610 --> 02:51:03.080
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

6441
02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:03.481
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

6442
02:51:03.481 --> 02:51:07.310
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about if you do away with the debt so that more people can go to</v>

6443
02:51:07.311 --> 02:51:07.791
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

6444
02:51:07.791 --> 02:51:08.571
<v Speaker 2>Like in other words,</v>

6445
02:51:08.571 --> 02:51:10.400
<v Speaker 2>the more people that go to college,</v>

6446
02:51:10.401 --> 02:51:11.930
<v Speaker 2>the better a country we are.</v>

6447
02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:13.400
<v Speaker 2>And yet they,</v>

6448
02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:15.400
<v Speaker 2>they literally fight against,</v>

6449
02:51:15.530 --> 02:51:15.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6450
02:51:15.891 --> 02:51:16.071
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6451
02:51:16.071 --> 02:51:20.690
<v Speaker 2>and it's always funny when you see people fight against their best interest,</v>

6452
02:51:20.691 --> 02:51:20.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6453
02:51:20.961 --> 02:51:21.980
<v Speaker 2>like why don't think it is there</v>

6454
02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:24.460
<v Speaker 4>best interest because they make money off of the fact that college,</v>

6455
02:51:24.461 --> 02:51:25.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6456
02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:25.891
<v Speaker 4>college education,</v>

6457
02:51:25.891 --> 02:51:26.900
<v Speaker 4>this country subsidized.</v>

6458
02:51:26.901 --> 02:51:27.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6459
02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:27.350
<v Speaker 4>neither.</v>

6460
02:51:27.350 --> 02:51:30.610
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why it's so expensive is because the government is involved,</v>

6461
02:51:30.611 --> 02:51:34.210
<v Speaker 4>the governments involved in all these loans and there's money in that.</v>

6462
02:51:34.211 --> 02:51:37.750
<v Speaker 4>And whenever you have a tremendous amount of money that's being generated by</v>

6463
02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:38.291
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

6464
02:51:38.291 --> 02:51:41.890
<v Speaker 4>whether it's college or law enforcement or the drug war,</v>

6465
02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:42.610
<v Speaker 4>you become,</v>

6466
02:51:42.610 --> 02:51:43.630
<v Speaker 4>it becomes an industry.</v>

6467
02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:44.021
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6468
02:51:44.021 --> 02:51:44.350
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6469
02:51:44.350 --> 02:51:44.591
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

6470
02:51:44.591 --> 02:51:45.850
<v Speaker 4>But you're talking about the military,</v>

6471
02:51:45.851 --> 02:51:47.050
<v Speaker 4>like shutting down those bases.</v>

6472
02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:51.700
<v Speaker 4>The same thing would would happen if you figured out a way to pay for college is</v>

6473
02:51:51.701 --> 02:51:52.690
<v Speaker 4>through tax dollars.</v>

6474
02:51:53.050 --> 02:51:53.883
<v Speaker 4>There would be,</v>

6475
02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:54.851
<v Speaker 4>without a doubt,</v>

6476
02:51:54.851 --> 02:51:56.020
<v Speaker 4>some people would lose their jobs,</v>

6477
02:51:56.470 --> 02:51:57.180
<v Speaker 4>lose their gigs.</v>

6478
02:51:57.180 --> 02:51:58.400
<v Speaker 4>But what I what I mean,</v>

6479
02:51:58.401 --> 02:51:58.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

6480
02:51:58.460 --> 02:51:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Is</v>

6481
02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:00.800
<v Speaker 2>that is the overall,</v>

6482
02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:01.551
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

6483
02:52:01.551 --> 02:52:02.960
<v Speaker 2>the overall health of the nation,</v>

6484
02:52:02.961 --> 02:52:03.840
<v Speaker 2>like if any way better,</v>

6485
02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:04.760
<v Speaker 2>smarter,</v>

6486
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:05.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6487
02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:05.770
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

6488
02:52:05.770 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>we're</v>

6489
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.903
<v Speaker 4>better off.</v>

6490
02:52:07.210 --> 02:52:08.290
<v Speaker 4>The one thing we look,</v>

6491
02:52:08.291 --> 02:52:09.700
<v Speaker 4>if you want to make the nation strong,</v>

6492
02:52:09.790 --> 02:52:10.750
<v Speaker 4>make less losers.</v>

6493
02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:11.620
<v Speaker 4>It's real simple.</v>

6494
02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:14.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the number one argument for cleaning up all these impoverished</v>

6495
02:52:14.741 --> 02:52:15.670
<v Speaker 4>areas in our country,</v>

6496
02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:16.001
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6497
02:52:16.001 --> 02:52:17.740
<v Speaker 4>All these like we look at what Baltimore,</v>

6498
02:52:17.890 --> 02:52:22.810
<v Speaker 4>I had this Guy Michael Wood on this podcast that was a former cop in Baltimore</v>

6499
02:52:22.811 --> 02:52:23.021
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

6500
02:52:23.021 --> 02:52:23.380
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

6501
02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:24.250
<v Speaker 4>when they were there,</v>

6502
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.811
<v Speaker 4>when he was working there,</v>

6503
02:52:25.811 --> 02:52:30.220
<v Speaker 4>they found some papers from the 1970s that showed all the crime areas and all</v>

6504
02:52:30.221 --> 02:52:32.200
<v Speaker 4>the tactics they were using and he's like,</v>

6505
02:52:32.230 --> 02:52:35.350
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking doing the same shit they were doing in the 1970s.</v>

6506
02:52:35.351 --> 02:52:36.340
<v Speaker 4>We're spinning our wheels.</v>

6507
02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:39.640
<v Speaker 4>What if you want to fix that area?</v>

6508
02:52:39.700 --> 02:52:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Like concentrating resources on that area and,</v>

6509
02:52:42.591 --> 02:52:42.870
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

6510
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:45.340
<v Speaker 4>and figuring out a way to solve this,</v>

6511
02:52:45.341 --> 02:52:45.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6512
02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:50.410
<v Speaker 4>this poverty cycle that just keeps going on and crime cycle that just keeps</v>

6513
02:52:50.411 --> 02:52:51.190
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

6514
02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:52.840
<v Speaker 4>Like you will have less losers,</v>

6515
02:52:52.841 --> 02:52:54.970
<v Speaker 4>you'll have less people that you have to prosecute.</v>

6516
02:52:55.100 --> 02:53:00.100
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about education because education and opportunity don't exist.</v>

6517
02:53:01.851 --> 02:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is,</v>

6518
02:53:02.450 --> 02:53:06.800
<v Speaker 2>that is the one thing about the cycle of poverty that I think a lot of people</v>

6519
02:53:06.801 --> 02:53:07.970
<v Speaker 2>can't understand.</v>

6520
02:53:07.971 --> 02:53:08.804
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

6521
02:53:08.890 --> 02:53:09.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6522
02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:09.810
<v Speaker 2>we'll get it.</v>

6523
02:53:09.810 --> 02:53:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Just get a job.</v>

6524
02:53:10.731 --> 02:53:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Like we'll know you,</v>

6525
02:53:12.041 --> 02:53:13.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that.</v>

6526
02:53:13.041 --> 02:53:13.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6527
02:53:13.371 --> 02:53:16.130
<v Speaker 2>and when you go to school and your books are,</v>

6528
02:53:16.220 --> 02:53:18.050
<v Speaker 2>are eight years old,</v>

6529
02:53:18.470 --> 02:53:18.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6530
02:53:18.741 --> 02:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>like when you say like this generation grew up with the Internet,</v>

6531
02:53:22.370 --> 02:53:23.810
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of kids don't,</v>

6532
02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:24.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6533
02:53:24.141 --> 02:53:24.710
<v Speaker 2>a lot of kids,</v>

6534
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:29.510
<v Speaker 2>like that's where the separation is where you have an iPad when you were in</v>

6535
02:53:29.511 --> 02:53:34.040
<v Speaker 2>school or did you have an eight year old textbook and then you get to the</v>

6536
02:53:34.041 --> 02:53:35.120
<v Speaker 2>college level.</v>

6537
02:53:35.810 --> 02:53:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Now you're supposed to compete with the kid who had the IPAD,</v>

6538
02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6539
02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:40.580
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

6540
02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:41.810
<v Speaker 2>the whole system.</v>

6541
02:53:42.350 --> 02:53:42.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6542
02:53:42.651 --> 02:53:42.851
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6543
02:53:42.851 --> 02:53:43.200
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

6544
02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:43.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

6545
02:53:43.550 --> 02:53:48.260
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things that it just makes sense to do something,</v>

6546
02:53:48.261 --> 02:53:48.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6547
02:53:48.561 --> 02:53:48.801
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

6548
02:53:48.801 --> 02:53:49.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like guns.</v>

6549
02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:50.713
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

6550
02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:53.170
<v Speaker 2>we have to admit that,</v>

6551
02:53:53.180 --> 02:53:53.451
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6552
02:53:53.451 --> 02:53:54.950
<v Speaker 2>we got to do something like that.</v>

6553
02:53:54.951 --> 02:53:56.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing before we do anything,</v>

6554
02:53:57.050 --> 02:54:01.040
<v Speaker 2>let's just admit we have to do something because whatever we're doing isn't</v>

6555
02:54:01.041 --> 02:54:01.820
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

6556
02:54:01.820 --> 02:54:04.040
<v Speaker 2>And then once we realized we have to do something,</v>

6557
02:54:04.041 --> 02:54:05.450
<v Speaker 2>then figure out what to do.</v>

6558
02:54:05.451 --> 02:54:07.550
<v Speaker 2>But instead we're,</v>

6559
02:54:07.551 --> 02:54:09.500
<v Speaker 2>we're always us versus them.</v>

6560
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.903
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

6561
02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:12.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6562
02:54:12.501 --> 02:54:14.570
<v Speaker 2>either no guns at all or,</v>

6563
02:54:14.571 --> 02:54:17.480
<v Speaker 2>or just carry your AK to a grocery store.</v>

6564
02:54:17.690 --> 02:54:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sure there's somewhere in between those two that works.</v>

6565
02:54:23.211 --> 02:54:23.571
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6566
02:54:23.571 --> 02:54:28.571
<v Speaker 2>and we have become a nation that has become so divided on every issue.</v>

6567
02:54:29.750 --> 02:54:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes when it's no reason to be divided other than the other side said</v>

6568
02:54:34.071 --> 02:54:36.800
<v Speaker 2>it and it just keeps anything from getting done.</v>

6569
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6570
02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what this country is going to be in 50 years.</v>

6571
02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:41.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6572
02:54:41.430 --> 02:54:45.150
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be very different because we're all these complications that we</v>

6573
02:54:45.151 --> 02:54:45.751
<v Speaker 4>have right now,</v>

6574
02:54:45.751 --> 02:54:46.830
<v Speaker 4>all the problems that we have right now,</v>

6575
02:54:46.831 --> 02:54:47.970
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be accelerated.</v>

6576
02:54:48.210 --> 02:54:50.630
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be accelerated when the growth of the population,</v>

6577
02:54:50.650 --> 02:54:53.150
<v Speaker 4>when more and more people around it's going to,</v>

6578
02:54:53.190 --> 02:54:54.510
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be more and more problems.</v>

6579
02:54:54.511 --> 02:54:56.850
<v Speaker 4>And then there's going to be all these technological issues.</v>

6580
02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:58.500
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be cyber crime is,</v>

02:54:58.771 --> 02:55:02.100
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be really difficult to keep money in your bank account.</v>

6583
02:55:02.101 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 4>People are just going to be stealing from bank accounts</v>

6584
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:04.873
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

6585
02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:06.740
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have virtual reality.</v>

6586
02:55:06.890 --> 02:55:10.910
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have people escaping reality in all sorts of ways that they're</v>

6587
02:55:10.911 --> 02:55:12.020
<v Speaker 2>not really doing yet.</v>

6588
02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:14.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's going to be just as addictive as crack.</v>

6589
02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:14.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6590
02:55:14.781 --> 02:55:17.600
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be people that are just dropping out of society and living in</v>

6591
02:55:17.601 --> 02:55:18.434
<v Speaker 2>the headset.</v>

6592
02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put on virtual reality goggles,</v>

6593
02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:21.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6594
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.943
<v Speaker 2>or we're going to,</v>

6595
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:26.450
<v Speaker 2>or people are going to be figured out how to use it and how to make society</v>

6596
02:55:26.451 --> 02:55:27.080
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

6597
02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:30.170
<v Speaker 2>you know better or educate people more or,</v>

6598
02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:32.180
<v Speaker 2>or allow for communication.</v>

6599
02:55:32.181 --> 02:55:33.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6600
02:55:33.230 --> 02:55:36.230
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about these kids who grew up with the Internet and other thing</v>

6601
02:55:36.231 --> 02:55:38.180
<v Speaker 2>knew growing up is there growing up globally,</v>

6602
02:55:39.570 --> 02:55:42.560
<v Speaker 2>they have friends in Europe and shit like that,</v>

6603
02:55:42.561 --> 02:55:45.080
<v Speaker 2>like that communicate with people from other countries all the time.</v>

6604
02:55:45.081 --> 02:55:45.740
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

6605
02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:48.080
<v Speaker 2>you learn so much.</v>

6606
02:55:48.430 --> 02:55:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so much cult,</v>

6607
02:55:49.641 --> 02:55:51.860
<v Speaker 2>more culturally savvy because of that.</v>

6608
02:55:51.900 --> 02:55:52.733
<v Speaker 2>Then so,</v>

6609
02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:53.700
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

6610

6611
02:55:54.831 --> 02:55:58.610
<v Speaker 2>it's like we can become much better or much worse.</v>

6612
02:55:58.611 --> 02:55:59.750
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really know.</v>

6613
02:55:59.751 --> 02:56:00.561
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I think,</v>

6614
02:56:00.561 --> 02:56:00.741
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6615

<v Speaker 2>we're going to be better than some shit happens you like,</v>

6616
02:56:03.081 --> 02:56:03.914
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

6617
02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:05.870
<v Speaker 2>we can't be trusted with anything,</v>

6618
02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:06.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6624
02:56:12.621 --> 02:56:14.780
<v Speaker 2>like when you have Trump,</v>

6625
02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:16.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6626
