1
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.830
Oh,
hello sweet bitches.
We're back at it again.
Ah.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.320
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by Ting Ting

3
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.330
is what you would call a no bullshit mobile company.

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.560
They put bs in the statements that you're supposed to read,

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.890
but you know,
and I know that that's fucking offensive.

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.360
That's kind of like saying the n word.
All right.
Just some bs.

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.790
Stop it.
Just say bullshit and don't say the n word anyway.
Dang.

8
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.720
This thing was probably like,
he's going to say it in her fucking advertising.

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.700
Nokia.
No,
no ting.
Goddammit.
He's getting Nokia racist now.
The inward.

10
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.770
Oh,
Nokia.
Okay.
Yeah.
They don't sell no cues.
Well,

11
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.070
they do sell HTC ones.
Here's what Ting is,
ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.850
Ting buys time on sprint,
which is an excellent service,

13
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.090
and then they apply their own rules like no early termination fees,

14
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.870
no canceling,
no bundling,
and you pay for what you use.
Megabytes,

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.340
minutes,
text data.
If you have a heavier month,
you just pay a little bit more.

16
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.220
If you have a lighter Monte,
pay less.
It's really simple.

17
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.180
If you don't use your phone much,

18
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:16.560
you're hardly paid all 98% of people who switch over at Tang save money.

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.850
I don't know if that's true,

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.760
but that's what it says on their website and they seem like good people.

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.570
So I'm going with that shit.
On the website it says,
I gotta be clear.

22
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.880
98% of people would save money with Tang.

23
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.710
It's because they do mobile differently and what they have four phones is the

24
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.580
sweetest android devices available.
Like the phone I'm using,

25
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.330
which is the Samsung Galaxy note three it's fucking awesome.

26
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.260
I that the iPhone looks like a baby toy to me.

27
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.170
How dare you people pretend that to put that thing away.

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.020
Barely a phone.
You're as old as I am,
right?
How can you even read that shit?

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.430
You'd known you can't read that thing.
She's on it.
Good move.
Good move.

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.730
A galaxy s four is a another one,

31
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.900
sort of a middle ground and another excellent phone.
They have the HTC one,

32
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.510
which is a beautiful phone.

33
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:09.390
It's fucking really dynamic to it as his speakers on the sides of it.

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.150
So the sound from it is fucking excellent.

35
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.020
They have that bigger one to now to the dude just came out with like is it the

36
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:20.430
mega call it yeah,
Nigga black.
Is that what it is?
It's a huge,

37
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.580
yeah.
Well whatever it is,
it's giant.

38
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.580
That HTC thing HCC makes them bad ass phones.

39
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.600
That Antonopoulos guy who was the bitcoin guy who were,

40
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.040
we have to get back on now.
Now that everybody's dying,

41
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.680
we have to get him back on.
Um,
anyway,
ting is a,

42
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:42.540
uh,
an excellent mobile service that our friends use.
Chris Ryan use it,
loves it.

43
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:46.080
Found out about it from this very commercial.

So go to rogan.ting.com and enjoy it.

50
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.590
We're also brought to you by audible.com the Internet's number one source for

51
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.360
audio entertainment.
I'm a huge fan of audible.com way back in the standup days.

52
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.190
Uh,
were audible used to do,

53
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:25.180
they used to do a thing with a couple of different comics,
uh,
where they would,

54
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.680
uh,
have like weekly standup.

55
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.050
They would pay these guys to come up with like five minutes every week.

56
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.220
It didn't really work.
Did you do it?
Just do it.

57
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.570
This was the pre podcast podcast man really was.
It really was.
And uh,

58
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.620
uh,
I want to say Marmel Marmel did,
I didn't do it.
Talk to me about you.

59
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.750
He's like,
he should have broke into it.
And I was like,

60
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.690
there's not enough room in the company really for that many comedians.

61
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.150
I like I had cleared the decks from me a little more and as you can see it

62
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.810
wildly successful.
It's a good movie.
You have to pay then.

63
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.310
And that was the difference.

64
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.530
They were just a little ahead of their time and nobody had smartphones.

65
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.611
Smartphones,
yeah.

66
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.580
You'd have to put it on like a little Walkman device or something.

67
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.790
He kept saying,
put it on your personal MP3.
It was like,

68
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:11.680
well why not page me and let me know that you're first of all mps carrier
pigeon,

69
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:15.970
repeat the show back to you.
But they were ahead of the curve man.

70
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:16.870
A big total way.

71
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.920
I did it from 2001 to 2005 that'll give you the curve that it was ahead of it.

72
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.050
Cause then podcast started what,
like about a year later,
two years later.
Um,

73
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.210
what time did we start?
We started in 2010 so we started four years ago.

74
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.250
I started the end of 2010.
They were way ahead of the time and that,

75
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.360
that's one of the reasons why their service is so amazing.

76
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.440
They have over 150,000 titles,
books stand up,
comedy specials,

77
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.640
lectures,
uh,
historical lectures.
You can listen to so much.
Cool Shit.

78
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:46.930
Radio shows are pals.
Opie and Anthony are on there.
It's a,

79
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.430
it's just an awesome service.
And if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe,

80
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.290
you can get one free audio book in 30 free days of audible service.

81
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.490
What do we got here?
Back in the UK,
the Sheffield edition.
Oh boy.

82
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.840
Look at that second 90 days.
That's Greg Proops fuckers.
Respect.

83
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.930
Hey those sold at gas stations on cassette.
Oh,

84
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.870
class product.
We were producing,

85
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.290
I was in a gas station once and I bought it on audible one from the old days.

86
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.000
I bought something from Nick Depalo and it turned out nick loves.
Anyway.

87
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.680
Nigga wasn't even getting paid for,
not he got $50 on the night,

88
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.270
but remember there was a whole lot about those cassettes like somebody had

89
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:28.840
recorded them and just started selling them.
I was at a gas station once and it,

90
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.160
and then I heard like just soon after I bought it,
you know,

91
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.900
for the ride and just soon after it I heard that nick was suing them.
Hey,

92
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.020
I'd love Nick Depaulo
did it.
Yeah,
he's silly.

93
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.790
He said he did a gas station because everybody had warned.

94
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.740
Thomas had Taylor and one was on sports and the other one's on life.

95
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.810
And I remember going with these,
some of your musings that you fuck you,
man,

96
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:56.180
I got $200.
You did it like you're literally,
the guy gave me $200 to,

97
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:58.100
could I take your son and like,
sure.
You

98
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.390
<v 2>know,
that's funny.
I'm in Cincy.
What do you want from me?
You know?</v>

99
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.930
<v 0>Yeah,
I'll take it.
What do you got?
200 bucks more than I got it.
Let's go.</v>

100
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:06.570
Let's run with it.

101
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.470
<v 2>Can I do my audible jingle that John Dimaggio made up on my show drunk one
night?</v>

102
00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:13.890
Sure.
Uh,
he just goes,
ah,
ah,
the bull,

103
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.810
when you don't feel lack read,

104
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.310
that's so perfect.
And that's what audible is.
It's fucking in a nutshell

105
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.600
<v 0>and the commercial.
Any better than that.

Get 30 free days so far,
don't blow service.

107
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.650
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t a human

108
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.940
optimization website.
There's a lot of fuckery involving human optimization,

109
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.150
ladies and gentlemen.
So we try to separate the wheat from the chaff as it were.

110
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:48.940
A great group that I say that correctly.
Yeah.

111
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.720
That's when I never know as it's coming off with my mouth.
Yeah.

112
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.940
<v 2>I think it's chaff.
I would say Chaffey than if it was champ because I prefer,</v>

113
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.990
it's like people just say Caribbean or whatever.
You have to

114
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.400
<v 0>spell it without that red squiggly line.
If my life depended on it,</v>

115
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:04.250
if you gave me a notebook,
tried to get me to,
it's spelled childhoods,

116
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.220
what we sell it on it are,
we sell a lot of strength and conditioning equipment,

117
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.360
uh,
fitness equipment,

118
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.800
supplements like hemp protein powder and raw cocoa butter and things that we

119
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:17.420
find.
If you,
you know,

120
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:20.990
you read literature online about beneficial items,

121
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.940
we just tried to sell what people use on a daily basis that are intimate,

122
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.290
mixed martial arts,
all these crazy crossfit fuckers,
Paleo people,

123
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.390
all these people that are into human optimization,

124
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:36.380
they're into giving their body good nutrition and working their body out in a

125
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.080
way that's beneficial for functional,
physical strength.

126
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.470
And that's the kind of shit we get involved with.
Um,

127
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.660
it translates directly to sports and that's one of the reasons why I love it so

128
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:48.980
much.
Things like kettlebells,
battle ropes,
steel clubs,
they're not weapons.

129
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:52.400
We're not forming an army to fight the apocalypse despite what everything looks

130
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:55.820
like,
where we're providing with brain supplements to make people smarter,

131
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.460
amps supplements to make them stronger and strength and conditioning equipment.

132
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.930
It looks like weapons.
No,

133
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.130
Greg Proops we're not really planning for the apocalypse.
It's just,

134
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:04.964
it looks that way.

135
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.250
<v 2>Well,
it's clever.
Subterfuge.
I'll tell you that.</v>

136
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.410
You had me convinced you guys are planning for the apocalypse.

137
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.190
Clever subterfuge would never make its way out of my mouth.

138
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.100
Somewhere along the line I'd be like,
what's the right way,

139
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.410
<v 0>right word here.
This girl groups,
I salute you.</v>

140
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.250
This girl followed me on Twitter the other day and she's an ex military girl and

141
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:26.340
she has a bunch of pictures of her with her little on it.
Uh,
kettlebells,

142
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.410
kettlebells,
a little girl.
She's a strong as fuck.

143
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.860
That's the 35 pound kettle bell for a woman.

144
00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:39.130
Unless you're like really fucking strong ex military so she can do it.

145
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.440
I guess so.
Damn.
That's a lot of fucking Wayne.
That's hard to do.

146
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.410
She's strong and shit.
Those kettle bells,

147
00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:49.800
like doing proper exercises and holding up the 35 pound me like that.

148
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:54.300
That's not easy.
That's like a dude doing a 70.
I left it,
uh,
uh,
pipelines.

149
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.280
You did a big glass

150
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.210
<v 1>window.
Shockingly heavy.
Was it ridiculous?
It looked like a dragon.</v>

151
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.670
I bought that.
Added to the blue hazard level or whatever.
I bought a bond once.

152
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:08.920
It looks like a fish and I can't move it anywhere.
It's like,
it's beautiful.
Okay.

153
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.790
Touch it.
That alien fish thing.
So beautiful.
Can't move it though.

154
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:15.030
He can't go near it.
Just scared of it.
You know,
that has to live in your house.

155
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:19.410
I can,
I'll shake charts or whatever.
Art,
you know,
it's,
it's art,
but it's a,

156
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:22.200
it's a bond.
It's a giant bomb,
right?
I can't use it as a bond.

157
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.230
You gotta use it as art,
but it's really beautiful.
But I never fucking use it.

158
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.780
I just stare at it and rolled joints on is anyway,

159
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.790
we don't sell joints it odd dotcom yet yet,

160
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.110
but believe me,

161
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.790
when the fucking flood gates open and the aliens land and Bitcoin is how you buy

162
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:42.060
everything.
We're going to be selling joints like a motherfucker,

163
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.170
but for now we sell hemp protein powder that is non psychoactive and if you have

164
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.100
to pee at work,

165
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.800
if they make you pee in cups to find out if you're doing things with your body

166
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:50.790
that they don't approve of,

167
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.800
the hemp protein powder will not let you test positive for THC.
It's not,

168
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:57.570
there's no THC in there.
However,

169
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.450
you should be warned that if you eat a lot of poppy seed bagels,

170
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:04.650
you will test positive for heroin.
And that's a fact.
I don't have,

171
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.660
I had that happened to a friend.
In fact,

172
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:10.800
the guy got arrested at Heathrow and he was flying from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi I

173
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.840
believe,
or Dubai,
I think it was Dubai.

174
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.080
And he got arrested because he tested positive for poppies cause he had bagels

175
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:22.590
on him like he had.
He had a a,
a Bagel with those poppy seeds?

176
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.430
No,
they had some sophisticated drug tests they sent him through.

177
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.010
Like they have these puffer tests.
Do you remember those puff puff,

178
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.830
puff and they find like ions or something in the air.

179
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.990
They would blow air on you and then you'd get out.

180
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.460
Well with him it tested positive for heroin because of the poppy seeds.
Wow.

181
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.850
I don't even know if they use the same test anymore,
but it was a big issue.

182
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.200
This port fuck was in jail for heroin.
Right.
In,
in,
you know,

183
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:49.380
in a foreign land in a very strict Arab regime.

184
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.020
Has like executed summarily kind of today.
Yeah.

185
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.710
I don't remember what country it was.
So it shouldn't be talking to at school.

186
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.460
I feel like it was a Dubai or Abu Dhabi.
They thought it was heroin smuggler.

187
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.070
Right.
You know,
they thought some crafty fucking European dude.

188
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:06.030
It's snuck in and was a slinging heroin.
Who's gonna ruin their street?

189
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.780
Their seats.
There's cities.
Did he eventually get settled that it,
that it wasn't,

190
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:13.050
yes,
I believe so.
But another woman was arrested for having Melatonin.

191
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.330
That's another thing people should be aware of.
Melatonin,

192
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:19.620
which we also sell at [inaudible] dot com is illegal and a lot of Arab countries

193
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.740
and this woman,
she was an executive for end mall in fact,

194
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.640
and she got detained over there for having fucking Melatonin,

195
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.040
which is a sleep aid.
I'm actually asleep.
It's not really that druggie.
No.

196
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.260
Well your brain produces it.
It's produced in the pineal gland.

197
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.160
Doesn't produce as much as it ought to.
Let's be honest.

198
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.290
You've got to stimulate the nerve a little hang by your ankles,
get one of those,

199
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:43.440
those uh,
gravity things.

200
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:46.710
Has there been anything that's negative about Melatonin ever published?

201
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:47.820
I don't believe so,

202
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.330
but I think they just have very strict laws about what to drug over there.

203
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.010
You know,
so it's an Islamic country.
You're not to drink,
you know,

204
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.000
but you can drink at bars though.
You can drink at bars.
We can't leave the bar.

205
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.420
There's no like you cannot go drunk to this treat.

206
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.150
But I definitely had drinks in an Arab country.

207
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.120
I definitely had drinks in Abu Dhabi and it was definitely illegal,

208
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.080
but there are very clear as to like how you would behave outside of there.

209
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.330
Like you can't just go London event like London.

210
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.380
London is crazy as fuck.
You get drunk in London,

211
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:19.750
you run out and everybody's hugging everybody or fighting.

212
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.470
You don't piss drunk in the streets and yelling at each other,

213
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:26.890
calling each other cons and it's a fucking great time.
There's none of that.

214
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.790
And I'll be dogs.
They got that shit locked down.
Everybody's super polite,

215
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.440
very orderly and uh,
they keep an eye on,
on trunk.
People,
even bars.

216
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:39.380
They don't let you fucking wreck everything.
Oh,
not at all.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

217
00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:41.220
You'll go straight to jail.
I don't know how that,

218
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.030
this has anything to do with on it,

219
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.820
but when I was trying to say is don't break Melatonin.

220
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.660
Don't bring on it's Melatonin to a foreign land.
Unless they've sorted that out.

221
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:52.630
I hope they have.
Melatonin is not a drug.
It's not going to get you high,

222
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.230
but it'll help you fall asleep.
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.
N n I t.

223
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:00.700
Used the codeword Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements.
I said,
op,

224
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.490
I didn't even say off,
but you know what I was talking about,
right.

225
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.630
It's sort of context.
It's all in context.
Used the code word Brogan,

226
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.070
Greg Proops whose

227
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.360
experience Joe Rogan podcast,

228
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.760
the lovely and talented artist formerly known as Greg Proops.
Thank you sir.

229
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.520
Thanks for doing this,
man.
Thank you for having me on.
Buddy.

230
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.310
Already turned several phrases that I've never

231
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.590
given a lifetime of thinking clever subterfuge.
That's a wall.
That's an awesome,

232
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.600
that's been used on your show.
No,
never at both of them.

233
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:47.670
Clever subterfuges such an awesome one too.
It's a two word whammer you know,

234
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.370
it's very rare that you can knock something down like that with two words.

235
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.670
I set you up with the off speed and then I bring in the high hard cheese.

236
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.910
It's true because it's like overused,

237
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:03.210
but clever with subterfuge is a deadly combination is such a great word.

238
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.390
I don't use it enough.

239
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:09.130
I like persiflage cause that's just like totally cloaking the issue.
Yeah,

240
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:10.720
that's a good one.
Yeah,
that's a good one.

241
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:15.400
That'll make people not sure whether I agree with you because if they get in any

242
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:16.510
sort of an argument with you,

243
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:19.420
it would be revealed that they don't truly know the meaning to that word.
Yeah,

244
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.580
exactly.
That's why that one works here in la,
especially if you're in La,

245
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.830
you know that's a,
that's a,
Tamara was talking about how he,
uh,

246
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.690
would do that with Dennis Miller.
Him and his ex wife.

247
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.110
They would make up a word and say it around Dennis Miller.
You know,

248
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:35.980
it was like just,

249
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.410
it was like when Hemingway went with the spittoon in a by you and he would like,

250
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:44.950
she,
yeah,
like they're just making things up and he would laugh.

251
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.650
He would laugh at like,
they would make up a fake word.
Yeah.

252
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.170
And they would do it like,
you know,

253
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.410
diamond rare is a buster and we would do it purposely park with them.

254
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.370
That's hilarious.
With fake words.
Right,
right.

255
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.300
You don't want to be the ass hole doesn't know that.

256
00:14:57.301 --> 00:15:00.410
That's like your work and Tata Surest,
Bam.

257
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.920
But he's that a weird thing where people like have an ego vested in knowing

258
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:10.700
something.
Like you can't know everything.
No.
I always want to ask if,

259
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.481
I don't know though,

260
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:14.780
like if I don't know a word too much using I'll say I haven't heard that.

261
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.900
There's nothing wrong with that.
Why do people resist that so much?

262
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.050
Cause then like men that don't want to ask for directions is the satellite down

263
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:25.700
to not so there.
I'd like to say I was more involved in that regard,
but I'm not,

264
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.160
how come you don't ask for directions?
You want to get robbed?

265
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.300
Like to be told what to do.
I don't like don't walk signs like stop signs.

266
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.840
I think that's why people shoot yield signs on the side of the road and meth

267
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:39.830
areas because people just get tired of the signs bearing down on them all the

268
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:42.020
time and they,
they gotta plus it's,

269
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:44.700
you're fighting the power shooting a yield sign,
right?

270
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.650
Oh I'm going to kick this math.

271
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.250
All the signs to shoot.
That's like the saddest song isn't it?
Down.

272
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:57.110
And that's the one that shot up.
It's like,
why stop fuck you.
I'm not stopping.

273
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.570
I don't want to shoot this side.

274
00:15:58.571 --> 00:16:01.010
Cause what if somebody goes through the stop sign and killed somebody I love.

275
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.003
Yeah.
Alright.

276
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.480
You can shoot the fucking shit out of a yield sign and I'm just going to be
okay.

277
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.950
Fuck you.
Yield yield yourself knowing that you should know how to yield.

278
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.010
You get to it.
One was traffic circles.
Yeah,
you should fucking figure it out.

279
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.400
Everybody working out together now.
No one knows how to.

280
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:18.590
They have a little roundabouts in west Hollywood.
And uh,

281
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.220
I lived in England and you learn how to work at a roundabout,
but people in La,

282
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:26.300
I've never quite figured out how,
what they're commonplace in the east coast.

283
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.050
I had one right down the street from my house where Dick Doroty,

284
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.180
the famed comic of Boston.
You ever heard of Dick door?
Godfather of Boston.
Oh,

285
00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:38.360
okay.
She's old school dude.
He,
he uh,
used to actually book a lot of rooms too.

286
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:40.010
I worked for him at times.

287
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:42.020
He was like the first guy to ever had them mind headlined me.

288
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.200
So I've got a warm spot in my heart for Dick.

289
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.840
He wiped out on one of those loops.
Oh,
just gone through.
Yeah.

290
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.900
I was going through one of those traffic circles and somebody hit him.

291
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.970
Fucked him up too.
Cause he was already,

292
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:58.030
I believe he was in his least fifties at the time and it was a pretty bad break

293
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.500
and he was laid up in his house like a cast on for quite awhile.
Yikes.

294
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.760
Yeah.
But that's,
cause those traffics are 20 now.
How they work.
They're weird.

295
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:10.070
You're supposed to let the person go.
That's how it works.

296
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.820
Don't jump in ahead of them.
That's not how it works.
Don't,
don't.
Yeah.

297
00:17:13.821 --> 00:17:18.020
Don't be a dick.
Don't try to like save an extra second and cause death.

298
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.600
Whoever's in the circle,
it's theirs until they get out of the circle.

299
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.060
And that's why,
and you get to go around to get,
if you miss your turn,

300
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:27.040
that's what makes them a circle.
There's Dick Doroty dig Doroty got probably now.

301
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.130
He was actually in a band.
Yeah,
he's okay.
I mean,
I'm sure his ankles.
Fuck,

302
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.730
it's a bunch of comic clubs.
Yeah,
we always did.
Yeah.

303
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.820
W he was the first guy to ever headlined me.

304
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.750
The first guy that took the first guy to ever give me like real work on the road

305
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.950
and put me in like,
yeah,
you know,
legit clubs.
Dick Doherty's,
comedy hut.

306
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.350
I worked there with Bobby Kelly and Dane Cook when Dane Cook was a part of

307
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:52.260
Allen,
the monkeys who Dane Cook was a in a,
a troop,

308
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.570
like an Improv troupe with Bobby Kelly.

309
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.220
And they would do sketches and then they would um,
do stand up.

310
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.100
Like they would all do a couple of sketches and then at the end they would eat,

311
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:03.510
you do individual standup,

312
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.850
but they'd do five minutes each or 10 minutes each or something like that.

313
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.840
And Dane was part of that.

314
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.360
And then Dane and Bobby started doing standup on their own.

315
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:13.740
And now al lives out here.
He's doing something,
something show Biz related.

316
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.790
<v 2>I'll a improv group names are awesome.
Uh,</v>

317
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.200
I lived in San Francisco and there was a group there called Papaya juice and

318
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.960
they were the old school guys.
And then,
uh,

319
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:30.030
our group was called fault line.
Get it.
Cause we were from San Francisco.
Yeah.

320
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.600
That's the kind of shit you have to live down the rest of your life.

321
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:36.220
But it's like,
Hey man,
we were 20,
you know.
Yeah.

322
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.090
Is that how you got into comedy through uh,
like doing an Improv troupe?
Oh,

323
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.860
I've never seen it.
Yeah,
no.
Yeah,
it is actually.
Yeah.

324
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.510
I was in a group with a bunch of guys in San Francisco,
in a,

325
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.080
a Mike Mcshane was in that group.
I don't know if you know Mike,
he said,

326
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.440
I heard the name actor and he was on his lung and stuff.
And uh,
okay,

327
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.950
that's where it is.
And then,
uh,
we,
uh,
uh,
um,
then,

328
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.540
then I did stand up after that when we broke up and then we all kind of did our

329
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:04.200
own thing after that.
But we,
we wrote sketches to,
and we did Improv.

330
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:08.370
So like we had a show that had sketches and improvident we put it on at a place

331
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:12.620
in San Francisco at ninth and market.
This isn't an eighties.
And,
um,

332
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.760
yeah.
And then,
you know,
so we had little costumes and shit like that.
And,
Oh yeah,

333
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.810
we wrote songs and everything.
What kind of sketches?
Like what would you do?

334
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.630
Like some of the funnier ones we did one with these two poodles were uh,
uh,

335
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.460
in love,
uh,
at the two old ladies are taking two poodles out for a walk and,

336
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.260
and we had,
you know,
they had to wear a little like dog is or whatever and they,

337
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.920
they had this mad French affair.
I remember micro thought one.
Uh,

338
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.840
but we would do political stuff too.
Like we would do a whole is about uh,

339
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.760
uh,
law or I remember we did a Nelson Mandela,

340
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:48.060
like sesame street sketch that was supposed to be part of a show.

341
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.120
I should think of a funnier one so far.

342
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:52.950
I don't think I've rocked you with any of the high now.

343
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.990
We used to do a talking heads parody.

344
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:57.870
That was how we would open the show and I would talk to crazy suit

345
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.600
was to say it's not here.
And it was a,

346
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.220
<v 1>was he the first guy to rock the giant suit?
I think so.
I think he was right,</v>

347
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:07.600
yeah.

348
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.400
Have you ever seen the videos of him driving around Manhattan and a bicycle now?

349
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.790
No.
Why does he do that?
He's a bicycle enthusiast.
Yeah.

350
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:15.530
They actually did a short documentary on it,

351
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.310
on him and his bicycle routes and where he goes,

352
00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:21.080
places that he goes to their bicycle friendly.

353
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.900
He loves getting around on bicycles.

354
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.290
And apparently on the west side there's like a path,
like a big path.

355
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:32.240
It's just for bikes were joggers and people on Bikes and David Byrne like takes

356
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:37.220
that to work every day and drives around with fucking cabs and shit.
Earn.
Yeah.

357
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.200
He takes it to concerts.
There's a video of him,
see if you can find it too much,

358
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.110
but okay.
He'll,

359
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.700
he'll get on his bike and go from his apartment to a concert and play and play

360
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.070
from his fucking bike.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's weird band.

361
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.270
So he's a French guy from the twenties living in Manhattan.
He's a Rockstar,

362
00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.140
but he loves it.
I mean,
I guess it's probably,
it's good exercise for sure.

363
00:21:00.141 --> 00:21:04.780
It was good.
It looks great.
It looks,
he looks very,
it looks healthy.
Um,

364
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.740
and it's probably fun.
You know,
and I bet walking is fucking boring to him.

365
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:12.190
Once you do that a lot.
You're on your pike.
He's zipping around.

366
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.240
Walking is a stroll.
Yeah,
bikes are fat and you're also,

367
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.280
you're like writing something,
you know,

368
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.660
like we forget that it's fun to ride a bike.
Like my three year old,

369
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.950
my five year old,
when they get on bikes they're like woo
woo.

370
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.950
We forget that bikes are awesome to ride.
Bikes are fun.

371
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.010
When you first get unlimited freedom cause he means you got nad range now it's

372
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.230
like your car,
you can finally go to the store.
Yeah,

373
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:41.150
you can get around the neighborhood.
You can go miles.
Yeah,
you can get,

374
00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:44.350
you can go down to the park and do the thing and come back and you would run

375
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:49.150
into packs of other kids like dogs.
Like why all on bikes bikes.
Everybody nodded.

376
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.630
Looking at into the squirrely.
It was like the,
you know,

377
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.770
the modern day version of people in a horses.
Absolutely.
Riding Hood days.

378
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.650
They would run into each other in the woods and try to figure out if anybody had

379
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:04.150
beef.
Yeah.
Figure out if you had a fucking sling,
some arrows on a bitch,

380
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.250
but did you see the videos of David Byrne?
We,
uh,
we were playing.
If it's crazy,

381
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:13.300
he's,
I mean,
he's super dedicated to it.
It's kind of impressive,
you know,

382
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:15.590
because it is impressive.
It takes cameras with them.

383
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.450
We put the Gopro on and you could watch him go through a Manhattan.
It's like,

384
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:23.200
wow.
Does he wear a helmet?
Yeah.
There he is.
Yeah.
He wears a helmet.

385
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.350
I guess I could look at one of the other monitors instead of the one behind me.

386
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.750
I'm not very clever.
Oh,
there it is.
Yeah,
I know.
He's still skinny.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

387
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:35.800
No,
he's in great shape.
He,
he,
you know,
he seems like healthy because of it too.

388
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.500
I mean,
you think about it,
that's a lot of really good exercise.

389
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.570
Riding a bike is great cardio.
It's good for them.
It's just,

390
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.780
it's fucking good exercise.
It's fun.
What would be better at running?

391
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.990
The problem is Tommy's,
a girl has got a great joke about it.

392
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.360
Bikers that think they're fucking cars and they're like,

393
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:57.130
get in the middle of the street.
You know it's,
it's so true.
There's,
there's that,

394
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.630
there's this,
the relationship with cars.
It's like,
it's,
it's too,

395
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.870
if everybody was on a bike,
it would be awesome.
It'd be great to ride bikes,

396
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.090
but everybody's not on a bike.
There's a lot of these assholes,

397
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.050
these giant metal boxes that are texting and when you're on a little bike and

398
00:23:11.051 --> 00:23:15.580
someone's in a giant metal texting box where they looking down every 10 seconds

399
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.240
and a squash,
you like potatoes,
you're going to go fly in at the very least,

400
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.450
something horrible.
I can't ride a bike in la over.

401
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.600
It's not so much that I'm against bikes.
It's the,

402
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.620
I drive just to even driving over here today.
I already experienced the,

403
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:30.700
I hate living here.

404
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.450
You know the word bum you out so hard because of the way they're driving that

405
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:35.830
you're like,
did you go to San Francisco?

406
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.940
You would do would fit right in like a glove.
I know,
but that's what I'm saying.

407
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:44.410
Why can't afford to live there and I'd have to,
I'd have to live in like Belmont,

408
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.520
one of the little suburbs.

409
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.040
I actually looked at real estate when I was in San Francisco.

410
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.110
I was some friends that live up there and I was like,
hmm,

411
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:52.280
I wonder what I could buy here.

412
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.130
And I was looking at these fucking houses in the city.

413
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.450
There were like $4 million and they were smooshed next to each other.

414
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.240
I mean fucking smushed and you're looking at the house and you like it's,

415
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.950
it's a nice house.
Sure.
But that's not a $4 million house.

416
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.200
You get no yard and the roof work.

417
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:13.130
Sometimes if you're lucky you had an old ass house and if one of them goes up in

418
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:15.530
flames,
better hope it's not the one in the bottom right.

419
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.250
Cause if it's on the bottom of the hill the fucking fire goes uphill.

420
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.350
But if it's at the top of the hill,
you might make it here,
let make it,
you might,

421
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:21.831
they might,

422
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:24.740
they might be able to soak everything down that's connected to each other.

423
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.880
We have to keep your house moist,

424
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:28.670
which is easy as San Francisco just let it sit there.

425
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.490
They're usually pretty moist.
Just leave the hose on when you're running.
I mean,

426
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:33.680
I love it after,
I'd love to have a crib up there.

427
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.210
I should have bought one when I lived there,

428
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:38.380
but I didn't have any money when I lived there.
When I left.

429
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.610
That would have been a good investment.

430
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:43.310
And who would've thought that it would become this unbelievable.

431
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:46.820
Tend to hang out and we thought it was expensive then.
But yeah,
no,

432
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:48.850
I never thought it would become,
uh,
you know,

433
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.590
toon town or whatever where everything was,
uh,
you know,

434
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.830
everybody's heading off on a little light bus to that little factory making

435
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:57.830
stuff.
I know.
I didn't think it was going to turn into that.

436
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.710
And then that would be the privileged class.
Do you know anybody who does that?

437
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.550
Do you know anybody who works?
No,
I doubt I would if I had Google glasses,

438
00:25:04.551 --> 00:25:06.440
I would see if I could see them in my mind.

439
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.980
But I don't have Google glass size to have regular glasses,
glasses to book.

440
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.770
I says,

441
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.720
I got to try Google glass way back in the day when it wasn't ready for prime

442
00:25:15.721 --> 00:25:19.250
time and let it was it did it work?
Yeah.
Well I didn't like it.

443
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.440
I think there's something there for sure,
but it's not,
it's a baby.
It's like,

444
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.303
you know,
it's like,

445
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.900
it's like a dual reel recorder for sound.

446
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.480
You don't need that anymore.
You have a phone,

447
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.840
you press the APP on the phone and you can hear everything really clearly.
Yeah.

448
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.110
You know I,
that's what that stupid thing is.
It's just,
it's not ready yet,

449
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.690
but one day there's going to be something weird like that.
Oh,

450
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:44.210
of course there will.
You Swipe it and you can see things.

451
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:48.620
You see images in front of you can move them.
You could say Google,

452
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.260
Greg Proops and it'll pull up a wiki on you and you can look at the Wiki.

453
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.410
It's weird,
man.
The navigation thing too is weird.

454
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.350
You're looking at this floating thing in front of your eyeball.

455
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520
It's telling you where to go.

456
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.450
I didn't like it because I have a phone and I to do all that shit on my phone

457
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:04.890
and I don't have to be attached to it.
Like a robot.
Like yeah,

458
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.110
I'm not ready to December yacht yet,
but that's the next step.
Right.

459
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:12.920
And that's why those or do you ever read an author named Dan and banks?
He,
ah,

460
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.790
he passed away last year.
There's Scifi out there.
But to make long story short,

461
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:17.780
he,
his,

462
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.200
his world that he created what's called the culture and it was basically our

463
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:22.520
world,
but amplified interest.

464
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:27.521
Hifi thing were benign nice people who believe in global warming and music and

465
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.130
good times and you know,
shag rugs and whatnot.
My folks,
but all the right,

466
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.840
what Nice White folks.
Now my folks,
my people,
my people.
And then,
uh,

467
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.260
there was another,
uh,
force in the universe that was another culture,

468
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.070
but they weren't the,
they were slightly more

469
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.280
<v 3>primitive and they believed in war and rape and murder and shit like that.</v>

470
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:48.360
And so the culture,

471
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:50.820
because they had taught themselves not to be that way anymore.

472
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.160
A thought that it was their duty to empirically lay their values on every other

473
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:59.010
culture that they ran into.
Wait a minute man.

474
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.280
But in any case that sound familiar?
Yeah,
that's what made it so good.

475
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.440
Yet the computers in it,
uh,

476
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:06.720
where your friends and spoke to you and sort of rolled with you.

477
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:08.820
You'd could have one like a pen in your pocket or whatever,

478
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.790
but then also they'd be like next year and be like,
Joe,
what's up?

479
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.910
It'd be like a floating thing and it would age with you and you know,

480
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.420
so you were kind of always on,
you know what I mean?

481
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.510
And if you want to do feel a certain way,
you didn't have to take drugs.

482
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.600
You have all these glands that were already genetically and UC.
It could be like,

483
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.110
I want to be hyper and focused right now and you'd glance some go.

484
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.450
And then like I want to be high and out of it and trip.

485
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.250
I'm going to have some Zang or whatever.

486
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:35.340
And then you'd mix that with maybe alcohol or something he'd smoked too.

487
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.810
You know,
we're already doing these things.
I know,
but I mean I thought that he,

488
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.270
he is,
uh,
you know,
and if you wanted to change sex,

489
00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:44.160
like say you want to have a baby,
like you're Joe,

490
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:46.530
but like for a couple of years you want to be a mom and have a baby,

491
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.540
you can change sucks gradually by grounding and then you can have your baby and

492
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:54.210
then go back to being a man again if you want.
Totally going to happen.

493
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.080
Well that's what I,

494
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.440
I really feel like he anticipated all of these things without,
and also the,

495
00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.940
the uh,

496
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:04.050
liberal fascism of people that have technology at their disposal,

497
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:07.800
that field that they have a benign view of the world without ever taking into

498
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:09.990
account.
And which was the,
the crux of all the books.

499
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:14.580
It's cause they constantly run into other cultures and other cultures still act

500
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:17.700
like humans here.
Did he write this?
Huh?
What year did he write?

501
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.970
This is all through the nineties and eighties nineties and two thousands.
God,

502
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:23.130
he nailed it.
That's I think the really good at,

503
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:25.760
you could read something and one was called the player of games are accessioned

504
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.160
and all these different ones.
It's just the point of view is what makes me laugh.

505
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.800
She's eating and have created a entities to live on.

506
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:34.010
You don't have to live on a planet.
They've made rings in Spain,

507
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.110
so they had made an asteroid.
And that people can live in those places too.

508
00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:39.210
And the ships are created by minds.

509
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:43.440
They're no longer created by people in a room,
uh,
mines that are underground,

510
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:45.930
that are unbelievably advanced.
Think of these things.

511
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.400
And then so when you get in a space ship,

512
00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:51.540
you don't program it her right drive it,
you go,
let's go.
And it goes,

513
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:55.110
we're off to the something system and it makes all the decisions.
And you know,

514
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.880
I not a highly developed a technology where you're just interacting with it on

515
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.530
that level.
And I have this guy,

516
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:04.890
Robert Greene on the podcast yesterday and we were talking about what will be

517
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:07.920
looked at when they look back at this time or our time right now.

518
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.580
What will be looked at?
Preposterous in a preposterous way.

519
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.740
I think these things will like the same way that we looked back at like

520
00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:18.240
Victorian tables,
having clothes on the legs so that people wouldn't get excited.

521
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.330
They would do that.
They would put dresses on legs.
Um,

522
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.000
I think sea world's going to be a meg one.
Seaworld.
Well,

523
00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.820
you mean like the idea of having like concentration camps for animals

524
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:29.280
zoos,

525
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.230
but seaworld specifically because the only argument about zoos is that they're

526
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:37.320
stupid animals.
It's the only argument.
I don't agree with it,
but it's the only,

527
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.410
the only argument that works.
But that argument doesn't work at all.

528
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.800
When you have these crazy

529
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.180
<v 1>see people,</v>

530
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.160
which is what dolphins and and an Orca zone and see where I'll just had this

531
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:51.220
crazy tweet,
man,
I dunno who runs their PR,

532
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.720
but it's the scariest tweet because this is what they say.

533
00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.130
They say a study shows that black houses or blackfish black house,

534
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:00.964
that's the MMA gym.

535
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.300
Black fish is propaganda and that it shows the commensurate death time for wild

536
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:11.350
orchids and for orchids that live in captivity.

537
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.530
That's their argument that they live the same length as if somehow another

538
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.480
length of life is what's important.

539
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:23.230
Not the fact that you're in up here in a swimming pool for the rest of your
life.

540
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.820
The fact that they even put that in a tweet is like,
are you guys nuts?

541
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.330
Do you guys really not understand what's going on?
You're,

542
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.830
you're in a prison camp going on.

543
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.450
Those things are like people there like alien people that don't have thumbs,

544
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.040
they can't manipulate their environment,

545
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.890
and so because they can't manipulate their environment,

546
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.340
we somehow or another except them for not being just like us.

547
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.410
They're fucking just like us.
They're just like us.
If you look them in the eyes,

548
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.250
there's a tangible sense that something intelligent is looking at clearly,

549
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.040
clearly,
oh,
and there's,
and look what they've done.
They've,

550
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.180
the persistence is the dinosaur times and they still exist and they've had to

551
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.670
put up with every manner of nonsense from us and shit,

552
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.550
and they could communicate over great distances.
They're sensitive.

553
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:10.400
They live in packs.
They have fucking of the social hierarchy accents.

554
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.400
They sound different in the north and they do in the south.

555
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.420
I mean they're really understand the concept of motherhood and fealty and all

556
00:31:16.421 --> 00:31:21.010
those things.
Yeah,
there,
watch the truth.
We respect the mother calf bond.

557
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:24.760
So Wyatt,
you forced them to fucking have incest.

558
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:29.680
We had a guy on who was a filled dimmers as a trainer and marine land in Canada

559
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:29.900
and just,

560
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.760
just tell us horrible stories about having to force feed these animals and he's

561
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:37.060
tweeted pictures of it and how just terrible the conditions are.

562
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:37.730
These the animals,

563
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:41.050
they take them into captivity and then they just totally sees up.

564
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.820
They don't want to eat,
so they have to force feed.
You want to kill themselves.

565
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.240
They're depressed beyond belief.
Well,

566
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:49.900
they don't live with their pack anymore and they probably either in a swimming

567
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:52.780
pool.
She said,
get out either.
There's no way to get out.

568
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:56.170
Can you imagine if something took humans and couldn't understand our words and

569
00:31:56.171 --> 00:32:00.160
trapped us in some fucking alien fish tank and just stared at us.

570
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.320
Oh my God.
Forced Veggie.

571
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.350
We would be horrified if we found out that one of our people was taking

572
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:08.710
captivity like that.
Hold on a second.
We wouldn't think,
oh,

573
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:12.760
he lived to be the same age as a regular person.
And that's what they're saying.

574
00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:18.020
It's vile.
But I've always called them.
Not though they really are.
I Dunno know.

575
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.610
Remember the one a few years ago that he had killed three or four trainers,

576
00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:25.210
Columbia is that his name?
To kill him.
And people were like,
oh my God.

577
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:30.040
And you're like,
um,
that question isn't really like,
why did he kill them?

578
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:34.920
She,
his job as a killer whale I think you'll find is too,
yeah.

579
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.740
Kill things and eat them.
I mean,
it was obviously out of frustration,
not out of,

580
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.310
uh,
I mean I'm not,
you know,
I'm just saying when they,

581
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.060
when they execute animals for killing keepers,
it always seems,
you know,

582
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.830
sort of like putting the question before the answer.
If you were in captivity,

583
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:55.730
you would certainly try to kill anything that was fucking with you.
And no,

584
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.310
either you're talking about something that doesn't have any moral standards.

585
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.160
There's no,
I mean,

586
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.780
we only assume that they have moral standards of behavior that they follow

587
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.350
because they all follow,
but they,
they commit genocide on a regular basis.
Yeah.

588
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.110
I mean,
it's not saying that they're perfect because they're not perfect.

589
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:11.870
Dolphins commit infanticide,
dolphins,
rape,

590
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.590
and then orchids eat dolphins.
They know they're smart.

591
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:18.830
They killed dolphins all the time.
So we're not dealing with,

592
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.660
it's not a black and white issue here.

593
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:24.020
It's not like they're the angels of the sea.
They're ruthless murderers.
Yeah.

594
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.980
All of them.
But they're awesome,
you know?
And that's their world.

595
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:30.230
I was going to say,
but they're there.
That's what they're born to do.

596
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.400
That's what we are too.

597
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:34.470
We're just pretending we're not because we're here and you know,

598
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.930
fucking the valley in the fucking office park.
I mean,

599
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:41.570
it's ridiculous,
man.
It was a real ridiculous,

600
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:44.900
we're pretending you're not a part of this machine is crazy fucking machine.

601
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.300
It's just the numbers are different and it distributed in a,

602
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:49.430
in a more unique way than in the dolphin world.

603
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.630
But ultimately the same shit gets done.
Your enemies get killed.
You know,

604
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.500
a lot of horrible shit goes down and then the orcas come in and fuck everybody

605
00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:58.334
up.

606
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.810
It's not much different than being in Afghanistan when helicopters are flying

607
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:06.960
overhead.
Really similar.
It's quite similar.
I they,

608
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:10.220
I think they dress better.
I love the Orca Motif.
You know,

609
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:11.960
the black and white is always there.

610
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.700
It documentaries causing real problems for seaworld.
That's great.
People,

611
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:17.980
the people in seaworld too.

612
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.530
I know that this is how they make their living and I know that they enjoy making

613
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:25.040
a living this way,
but you can't do it.
You can't do it.

614
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.140
I like what Michelle Michelle Rodriguez says,

615
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:30.770
she said that they should invest money in making robots,
you know,

616
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:32.510
for like the make make,
make fish,

617
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:36.560
robots and state of those things would kill people.
That's a good idea.

618
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.940
But I think the really the smart idea is to set up an area where there's no

619
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:45.590
fucking pollution where you develop a relationship with pods of dolphins.

620
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:49.610
So you communicate with them and exchange food for their attention and you come

621
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:52.100
and hang out with them and they're fucking smart.
They'll figure it out.

622
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.720
They don't have to go chase in tune off.

623
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:56.810
They'd go near this one particular raft would they have developed a treaty with

624
00:34:56.811 --> 00:34:59.330
human beings.
So the human being show up with tuna,

625
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:03.290
which would be far fucking cheaper than a giant building filled with shit.

626
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.500
But we could all get our shit together and just make friends with these fucking

627
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:08.720
things and give them food exchange for love.

628
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.700
We would have a good time with dolphins,

629
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.700
but instead we have dolphin prison camps and we,
you know,

630
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.790
paid to see them and they do flips in the commercials and in sync and

631
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.760
everybody's happy.
Yeah.
It's pretty freaky.
It's freaky.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

632
00:35:22.761 --> 00:35:24.860
you know,
we always think we're more superior to,

633
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.900
they always talk about ancient Rome and you know,

634
00:35:26.901 --> 00:35:29.350
the cause ancient Rome was so cruel and uh,

635
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.900
gladiators and then all the animal shows,
they used to kill thousands of animals.

636
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:37.901
But this is kind of our Roman mom really is taking highly developed creatures

637
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.710
<v 2>who can do complex behavior and you're training them to do these things for our</v>

638
00:35:41.711 --> 00:35:45.240
amusement and using it at a base,
sort of selling popcorn level.
And that's how

639
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.190
I feel bad because I have that photo of me and it's often now,
like I said,

640
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:55.191
remove or change Monterey from marine land on my luggage and it's the best thing

641
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:57.750
in the world because I can always tell it's mine.

642
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.330
I should have told anyone that now next luggage rock

643
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.760
will smell them.
I will smell.

644
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.640
I've got to grab his luggage because he's got a Max.

645
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.300
<v 0>Um,
yeah.
You didn't think about it at the time.</v>

646
00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:13.520
It was before we had that dude on right before blackfish.
Yeah,

647
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:17.170
before black fishing before.
But I've always had this thing about dolphins.

648
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:21.220
I got really high once in a boat in Hawaii and it changed my life just because

649
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:21.790
you want it off.

650
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.790
The dolphins were jumping around and that was yelling to them and they were

651
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:29.420
doing flips and we were looking at each other in the eyes and I was so
barbecued.

652
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.510
Yeah.
It was just so barbecued that I,

653
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.770
I felt this really crazy connection with this animal and I got to thinking while

654
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:39.370
while this was going on,
I was like,
this is just like me.

655
00:36:39.371 --> 00:36:41.920
It's just me living a different life.
And then I'm like,

656
00:36:41.921 --> 00:36:43.750
I bet if I was in that dolphins head,

657
00:36:43.751 --> 00:36:47.350
I would probably be thinking the way he thinks I would be living in that dolphin

658
00:36:47.351 --> 00:36:50.560
world.
And if he was me,
he would probably,
you know,

659
00:36:50.561 --> 00:36:53.380
if he had a language and he could use my lips and all that,
I mean,

660
00:36:53.381 --> 00:36:56.170
if he understood English,
he'd probably be just like me.
And I'm like,

661
00:36:56.171 --> 00:37:00.160
this is the same thing as us.
It's just in a different world.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

662
00:37:00.161 --> 00:37:01.480
It really is just like us.

663
00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.810
And people deny that because they don't have stuff that's,

664
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.450
that's the only thing that they're only reason why they don't.
I mean,

665
00:37:07.451 --> 00:37:09.700
what the fuck animal,
that's a wild animal.

666
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.030
It does this in place with a kitty cat.
Come on,
man.

667
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:17.530
You can't keep that in captivity.
That thing is smart as fuck.

668
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.970
It has a cerebral cortex,
40% larger than a human beings.

669
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.340
Those things are really smart.

670
00:37:24.341 --> 00:37:27.850
They just don't have to have thumbs in their world.
Thumbs would get in the way.

671
00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.720
They don't have to build houses.
They just go swim with a waters.
Awesome.

672
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.360
They just eat fish and fucking party and so they,

673
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.070
their fingers actually turned into flippers over time and they didn't need

674
00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:43.510
fingers.
These things started out on the ground.
They were smart as shit.

675
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.840
Way Smarter than a cat or a dog.

676
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.890
Way Smarter than a monkey.
I mean these things are fucking smart.

677
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.660
Really smart.
Like fucking people smart like flipper smart.

678
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.090
Maybe even smarter about that.

679
00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.000
Maybe they sold flipper short because they were haters.
Yeah,
no shit.

680
00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.050
Just like Lassie,

681
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:07.330
you know the ancient Greeks thought they were people were dying isis to turn

682
00:38:07.331 --> 00:38:10.250
them into.
Yes.
Yeah.
It wasn't that the rumor.
Well

683
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.650
<v 2>because they've always gotten along and the,</v>

684
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.810
when the world was more sailor oriented,

685
00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:19.280
like in the ancient times when you kept to the coast and you only went out for a

686
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.380
day or two because you couldn't even bring enough water with you and that sort

687
00:38:21.381 --> 00:38:21.501
of,

688
00:38:21.501 --> 00:38:25.310
the little Mediterranean dolphins were there always and dolphins were thought of

689
00:38:25.311 --> 00:38:27.610
is friendly because they often pointed you the way,
right?

690
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.550
Sometimes they'd come around boats just to hang around people and the sales play

691
00:38:31.551 --> 00:38:34.940
with them and killed them and eating them.
No,
they must've,
no,
I don't think they,

692
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.920
that they ate them in

693
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.210
<v 0>as much in the Greek times.</v>

694
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:39.910
I think they understood that they were more sensitive than that.

695
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.220
I'm sure they ate them occasionally.

696
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.540
When you go really hungry and you're out and you're going to eat one.
Yeah,

697
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:48.610
Japanese still do.
Do they eat them or they just murdered them?
Did they eat them?

698
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.470
<v 4>I think that's why they do and they still serve them?
Yeah.
About there.</v>

699
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.630
<v 0>Well,
I think the cove,</v>

700
00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:56.150
the reason why they're killing them is they're saying that they,

701
00:38:56.151 --> 00:38:57.950
they interfere with their tuna fishing.

702
00:38:57.951 --> 00:39:01.460
They the wipe out too much of the tuna and so it's like killing the enemy.

703
00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.580
It's like they feel like they have a finite amount of oil.
That's a great answer.

704
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:09.110
It's not a good one.
Oh yeah.
But there's no fish left anyway.
Is there really?

705
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.720
Well that was the other thing about Jiro dreams of Sushi.

706
00:39:11.721 --> 00:39:14.780
He was talking about the difference and the quantity of fish that they used to

707
00:39:14.781 --> 00:39:15.740
get out of the ocean.

708
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.890
<v 4>Wasn't there a part in the coke that they actually showed that there was fish?</v>

709
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:22.160
There was,
uh,
like they would test the fish what it was and they're like,
oh,

710
00:39:22.161 --> 00:39:24.400
this is dolphin.
I feel like there was a part of them.

711
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.180
<v 0>I don't know.
I couldn't watch the whole thing.
I had to shut it off.</v>

712
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.560
They'll certainly,
they were right.

713
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.980
Roped into the tunic catches forever and ever if they,
if they are not still.

714
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.070
Yeah,
those things freak me out.
I've watched a video once.

715
00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:38.670
The reason why I can't watch the movies,
cause I watched a video of a,

716
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.620
a Japanese fishermen killing dolphins with s w like a knife on a dock.

717
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.440
There were flopping around on the dock and he's slicing their neck and he's

718
00:39:46.441 --> 00:39:49.440
jumping out of the way and he's aware that there's a camera on him.

719
00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:53.430
So he's got this weird uneasiness about it.
It's really dark.

720
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.900
It's so disturbing to see that animal that's smart as a human and he's murdering

721
00:39:57.901 --> 00:39:59.430
a human.
It's just like a human,

722
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.030
<v 4>I mean,
the dolphins when at zero did appear like they were having fun and just</v>

723
00:40:05.031 --> 00:40:05.864
everything was

724
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.350
<v 0>planning with people.
It's probably the highlight of their day.
Right.
You know,</v>

725
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.710
if you went to prison and the prisoners couldn't kill you and they didn't have

726
00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:16.370
arms and they just needed hugs,
they'd be,
they'd be hugging the shit out of you,

727
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.770
you know,
and that's what's going on with the dolphins.

728
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.200
That's not what's going on with killer whales,

729
00:40:21.201 --> 00:40:24.400
which is why you can't get in the tank with killer whales because yeah,

730
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.820
they have the ability to kill you.
I mean,

731
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.910
the Dolphin probably could fuck you up really bad if it wanted to,

732
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.290
but there's been like no evidence of a dolphin ever doing that to a person.

733
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.220
They apparently don't fight us,
but killer whales have killed a bunch of people,

734
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.920
especially that only in captivity,
by the way.

735
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.970
We're looking at attacking the wild.
Nope.
No.
They've saved people in the wild.

736
00:40:43.971 --> 00:40:47.090
They've saved strangers in the wild.
They're just fallen into the water.

737
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.830
They've helped people that were drowning.

738
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.870
They've nosed him up and brought him to other boats,

739
00:40:50.871 --> 00:40:53.980
like literally moved on with their nose to the boat and let,

740
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.760
like they knew where their friends were and helped them.
Yeah.
Well there's,

741
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:02.210
there's so sentient that they let animals go.
The,
when they hunt,
they will teach,

742
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.560
uh,
the like little kill a bunch of seals and they'll play with one and they all

743
00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:10.220
have their,
their children learn how to hunt with this like one wounded seal.

744
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.720
And then they'll let it go.
They're like,
go,
you can go.
You know,
we,
we,

745
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.740
we have a good exchange here.
We're not going to kill you,

746
00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:19.070
but we needed to use you.
We feel bad.
We don't need to eat.
You were full

747
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.590
when they hunt blue whales and the bigger whales,
they,

748
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.000
they post up,

749
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.450
they do chew on one side and one on the other side of the estuaries and stuff.

750
00:41:29.451 --> 00:41:32.330
And that's what,
when there's the migrate it,
uh,

751
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.340
when the blue migrate off California

752
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.340
<v 2>Day,
the people who watch these things,
uh,
uh,</v>

753
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:41.300
can't do anything about it and they didn't want to interfere but to kill her

754
00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:45.770
whilst each shot to kill them.
And,
and they,
they hunt like Jurassic Park style,

755
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:47.060
you know,
it is drastic.

756
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:50.180
Went down the pipe and chew in the back so that you're lured out.

757
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:51.290
And then when you get in the middle,

758
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.420
the other one comes out at you and not see any of that.

759
00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.300
<v 1>Have you ever seen the videos?
Oh yeah.</v>

760
00:41:55.301 --> 00:41:58.230
I've seen them flipping the seals in the air and dolphins in the hair.
No.

761
00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.750
The videos of them eat in a whale.
Oh golly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's dark.

762
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.480
There's some shocking,
I mean this is the new way of nature,
right?

763
00:42:04.481 --> 00:42:06.790
This is the word.
Like you said,
they're murderers.
That's what they do.

764
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.610
It is the way of nature and it's our way to,
and you know,

765
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:12.430
we're hypocrites if we try to pretend that there's something wrong with the way

766
00:42:12.431 --> 00:42:12.941
they live,

767
00:42:12.941 --> 00:42:17.520
but it's just disturbing in its raw real God.

768
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.560
Jesus.
Zero concern for us watching.

769
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.210
<v 2>Did you think that's sort of why?
I mean,
not to get out,
but I'm not,</v>

770
00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:26.700
I've never read Moby Dick,
but of course I'm familiar with the story,

771
00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:28.290
but the whole idea of whaling,

772
00:42:28.291 --> 00:42:31.740
which really still going a little bit in a couple of countries like Norway and

773
00:42:31.741 --> 00:42:36.390
what not,
but um,
this country was founded on wailing,

774
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.370
you know,
the east coast,
uh,
especially New England.
Um,

775
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.260
they went all around the world and wailed the living daylights out of the
planet.

776
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.510
We're talking about hundreds of thousands of millions of whales they killed over

777
00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:52.800
the course of 150,
200 years.
And uh,
that culture is so amazing.
The,

778
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.650
um,
the,
the danger,

779
00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:59.670
the raw fucking danger of hunting whale in a boat.

780
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:05.250
You know,
you lowered three or four boats,
there's 20,
30 guys in each boat.

781
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.450
You're trying to put a jar in this fucker and then rope it on and then ride the

782
00:43:09.451 --> 00:43:13.860
fucker until you waste it and then render it right on the side of the boat,

783
00:43:13.861 --> 00:43:15.810
right.
Crane it up and you know,

784
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.660
Jesus Christ and then take all the oil out of that,

785
00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:20.850
fill the whole bolt for the oil and you're out for weddings.

786
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.820
And he would go out for what,
a year and a half year.
Wow.
Yeah.

787
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.050
And then come try to come back to New England with all your staff.
And uh,

788
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.110
it sucks.

789
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:33.280
<v 1>The whales are awesome because of whales were shithead.
Whaling would be awesome.</v>

790
00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.330
Like whales where were like monsters will make their life they depicted in that

791
00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:38.280
way,
but they even need it

792
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.200
<v 2>really sensitive.</v>

793
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.500
And there's a real story of Moby Dick One whaler and a guy just grabbed,

794
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:44.120
you can go on like Smithsonian online.

795
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:47.990
There's a story about well ram in the boat.
Then they fucking fought those boats.

796
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:48.824
Tooth and nail.

797
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.400
The whales were smart and sometimes they just turn on the boats and Bam,

798
00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:52.750
you know,

799
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.880
<v 1>smashed with a sign and Bravo.
That was the seal.</v>

800
00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:58.690
Pull up the one where the killer whales eat a whale.
Cause uh,
that's,

801
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.320
that's the most disturbing one.
The playing with the seals.
Fascinating.
Um,

802
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.150
it just shows how intelligent they are.

803
00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:06.340
They're actually training their young how to do this.

804
00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:11.260
The train them had a tip I ice,
uh,
RAF's over to knock the seal down.
Wow.

805
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.710
You can eat them and they're practicing and showing the kid had to do it and

806
00:44:14.711 --> 00:44:17.440
they're setting it up and putting the seal back in place.
I mean,

807
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:20.410
it's nuts when you watch it.
The level of intelligence,

808
00:44:20.411 --> 00:44:23.230
they're fricking really smart,
really smart animals.

809
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:27.370
There's an every at 20,000 leagues under the sea.
Vite Joel,
Vern,
God,

810
00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:29.980
I think I read it in high school,
you've seen in nearly the,

811
00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:32.130
in the book there's scene where there's a bunch of killer

812
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.070
<v 3>whales and they watched them go into a frenzy.
And also in the book,
uh,</v>

813
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.550
they use the buried treasure that they pull off the bottom of the seat of

814
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:41.710
support or rebellion.
And clearly captain nemos not white.

815
00:44:41.711 --> 00:44:44.910
He's like Indian or Indonesian.
Yeah,
yeah.

816
00:44:44.911 --> 00:44:48.090
They go to this one island where this prince is being mean to the population and

817
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:49.340
that's where it kept an email,

818
00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.780
gives all the gold too that he pulls off the bottom of the ocean.

819
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.600
And I always thought that's kind of an overlooked,

820
00:44:53.601 --> 00:44:57.210
a little part of the book that basically Nimo goes like,
you're on my ship,

821
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:00.090
you have to do what I want.
And then when they go to this one place,
he's like,
oh,

822
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:03.330
he gave all the gold of the rubbles and that's just sort of gets glossed over.

823
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:06.330
Like he's not supporting the dominant paradigm while he's down there.

824
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.020
He's against the US government.
He's,
he's giving money to rebels in Indonesia.

825
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:14.280
It's,
it's a pretty,
it's pretty groovy politics in it.
And what,

826
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:18.480
what year was that?
That's like the 1880s and then,
um,
uh,

827
00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.110
that's h g wells and Jules Verne,
Julia Frenchmen.
And they'll sit.
He Do,

828
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:25.560
who did it from the earth to the moon,
that one way that go to the moon.

829
00:45:25.561 --> 00:45:30.270
First men in the moon.
Uh,
any road.
I'm fent fantastic island,

830
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.480
magical island.
What's the name of the one with the fucking,
you know,

831
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:36.990
they got to the island and all the giant cars or island treasure on last.

832
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:40.320
Robert Louis Stevenson forbidden that you give us an island.
You know,

833
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:42.760
it's another,
it's like a Scifi jewel.

834
00:45:42.761 --> 00:45:46.660
Vern gets done over and over because it's the same five stories over,
you know,

835
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:51.360
ana,
she loves are always going to the moon of vi,
read war of the worlds.

836
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.080
The opening line is something like,
I can't remember the opening round,

837
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.320
I'm paraphrasing.
The Earth was,

838
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.370
we knew we were being watched or what we didn't know was we were being watched

839
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.140
and that's a great opening line for a Scifi novel.

840
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.180
The martians are watching us and then they shoved their ships and everything.

841
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.690
It's a beautiful Scifi novel because it's so precise.
There's no sigh.

842
00:46:13.691 --> 00:46:16.260
He made up all the site and wells really did make it up.

843
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:21.240
Like he knew nothing about technology so it's awesome.
Just go,
what was a beam?

844
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:22.363
You know like so he,

845
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.950
you know how the tripods come out of the ships and they have laser beams and

846
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.150
they basically laser beam everything.

847
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:30.540
Like he just started made up but it's going to be this beam of pure energy or

848
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:32.910
whatever.
Like you know what's fascinating and he did do that,

849
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:36.330
but that's what a lot of people use as their template for the future.

850
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.510
When they thought about like future weapons,
it was always a laser beam.

851
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:42.210
It was always a beam.
Well,
I think once,

852
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.640
once physics were understood that things were in particles,

853
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.060
that wasn't that big a jump,
that there would be just be,
first of all,

854
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:52.950
this isn't Zeus is thunderbolts the ultimate,
you know,
dude,
I'm,

855
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.030
yeah.
Just,
I mean,
just thunder in general.
The idea of this power,

856
00:46:57.031 --> 00:47:00.690
this electricity.
Everybody knew what electricity wasn't what it could do.

857
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.720
I would have loved to been alive before electricity was explained and see what

858
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:10.830
the fuck people were saying.
Did you imagine what people were saying back when,

859
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.260
you know,
people barely had a language,

860
00:47:13.261 --> 00:47:16.470
they barely could string together a sentence and you would understand and the

861
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:18.900
fucking sky bolts of lane coming out.

862
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:22.470
It's kind of hitting the ground balls of light and fruit through a field.

863
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.430
You have to deal with that.
You know,
there's been an instance that I read about,

864
00:47:26.431 --> 00:47:30.230
um,
we'll have ball lightning.
Like there's been instances of ball

865
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.640
<v 0>lightning that they think explains you.
Ufos.
Yeah.
I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

866
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:38.440
I think that did a lot of,
not all UFO was obviously yeah.
But some Ufo sightings,

867
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:42.550
they talk about these orbs that are flying orbs of light apparently under

868
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.070
certain geological pressures,

869
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:49.150
like certain pressures on near fault lines and,
and the like,
there's,

870
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.780
there's fucking bolts of lightening that would come out of the ground.

871
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.220
I wouldn't be surprised.
It's,
yeah,

872
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:57.250
it's supposed to in Atlanta it can last for like three or four seconds.

873
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.220
We'll have everything in the world is an electric charge and everything is

874
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.110
totally makes sense.
Right.
Just a weird spark,
you know,
that occurs.
What is this?

875
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.880
I've never seen ball light ball lightning.
Yeah.

876
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.760
<v 3>It's really exciting.
My wife and I were in a Capri once and uh,</v>

877
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:17.810
it,
it's a little island off the coast of Naples and um,
is that,

878
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.330
<v 0>well I think they're saying this is ball lightning.
Yeah.</v>

879
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:22.940
<v 3>Yeah.
That could believe it with the ball.</v>

880
00:48:22.941 --> 00:48:26.060
Lightning cause ball lightning has weird properties.
Yeah.
Look,
look at that.

881
00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:29.900
Just disappeared.
It,
it's a film roll in it righter than fuck.

882
00:48:29.901 --> 00:48:31.960
So you can see it from miles away.
Right and right.

883
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:35.260
And you mourn when lightening hits things.
You know how you always see sparks?

884
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.880
Yeah.
Shit.
Well,
my wife and I were sitting,

885
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:42.590
we were having dinner and this and it's a little island and a big storm started

886
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:45.290
brewing on the Mediterranean and all of a sudden everything,
you know,

887
00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:47.630
the ozone in the air and your hair starts to stand up.

888
00:48:47.631 --> 00:48:51.170
And it was a light breeze and Capri smells like Lemons and bay leaves.

889
00:48:51.171 --> 00:48:53.240
So it was really beautiful.
And I said to my wife,

890
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.210
and this is what a rabbit smells like right before the lid comes down on the

891
00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:01.080
pond.
Bayleaf and lemon.
And then,
Hey,
I'm I,
oh,
uh,

892
00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.050
and then we sat on the balcony of our hotel and the storm never hit Capri,

893
00:49:06.051 --> 00:49:09.710
but it was several miles away and we watched it and it just,

894
00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:16.130
just giant lightening strikes out and the clouds and then it never got close

895
00:49:16.131 --> 00:49:18.890
enough to rain.
You know what I mean?
Oh,
that's great.
And it was,
yeah,
I said,

896
00:49:18.891 --> 00:49:20.770
this is like watching the gods play,
right?

897
00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:24.260
Like here we're sitting here with a glass of wine and the air was electric.

898
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:29.330
And all you,
you'd hear it,
you know,
and then you,
you know,

899
00:49:29.331 --> 00:49:32.780
you see it and then you'd hear it afterwards because it was that far away that

900
00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.640
now you need clouds to have lightening.

901
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.010
And the clouds were just crashing together and it would,
you'd see like,
Shit,

902
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.490
<v 0>what I'm saying is where you were,
you didn't have to worry.</v>

903
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.800
There's no clouds above you.
You didn't have to worry.

904
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.270
<v 3>W we were,
it was at least a couple of miles away.
Wow.</v>

905
00:49:46.271 --> 00:49:49.940
So you don't have a clear sky said it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

906
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:54.070
Clear Mediterranean sky is simply that you could feel the raised electricity in

907
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:58.360
the air because there was a breeze blowing end and your hair was on an and.

908
00:49:58.361 --> 00:50:02.530
Wow.
And there was a lot of ozone,
you know,
from all the crashing,

909
00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:05.590
but it never got close enough to,
it never hit the island.
It never poured rain.

910
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:08.680
It just sort of stayed right off the island.
And I was like,
that's so exciting.

911
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:11.440
If I could always have storms to spectate,
you know,

912
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.610
cause she'd watch a ball just like shoot from one cloud to another arking rope,

913
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:18.400
you know?
And,
and it was endlessly entertaining.

914
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:21.520
There's nothing more entertaining than lightening,
you know,

915
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.280
then that the noise of the thunder in that smell of,

916
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.950
especially if you know you're not going to die.
That was what made it so great.

917
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:30.740
We were sitting there with a joint in a glass of wine.
It was like,
you know,

918
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.190
heavenly cause if you're in a city,
like if you're in New York City,

919
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.890
no storm goes on.

920
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.820
You have this weird feeling that lightening could hit this fucking building

921
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.730
anytime and my windows could explode.

922
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.480
I was on a plane with my wife going into Frankfurt,

923
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:52.481
Germany for the World Cup like in 2006 and we flew through a giant electrical

924
00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:53.954
storm.

925
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:58.760
So we're on the plane and I'm looking out the window and the plane's bouncing up

926
00:50:58.761 --> 00:51:02.180
and down and the giant ball of lightening struck the wing of the plane.

927
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:07.010
Oh my watch on.
And it went like this and then bang.

928
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:09.110
And that was a huge booming noise.

929
00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:11.300
The lights dimmed for a second and went right back on.

930
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:15.800
And everyone on the planet like that,
right?
Oh my gosh.

931
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.140
Flight attendants went fucking white.
Which then,

932
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.500
then I was a little scared because I thought,
well they shouldn't be freaked out.

933
00:51:21.501 --> 00:51:25.550
Right.
And my wife like,
you know,
panicky and I went,

934
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:30.380
not that I was so great,
but I went the wing still there.
Let's start there,

935
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.260
then hit the wing.
The wing is completely intact.

936
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.660
It hit the lightening rod at the end of the,
you know,

937
00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:37.130
the little metal thing they have at the end of the week.

938
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.010
They have a metal thing trines play telling us,
uh,

939
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.830
an exoskeleton thing around them.
So lightening hits,

940
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.980
it's disperses around the planet to prepare for that.

941
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.030
Obviously you have to write because they're going to fly through electricity

942
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.460
that look at that picture.
Oh my God.
Planes.

943
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.770
You never hear about planes blowing up because it got hit by looking at this,

944
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:59.300
watch this.
Oh,
that.
It's crazy because when you see it in real life,

945
00:51:59.301 --> 00:52:02.690
it looked like nothing.
Like so fast.
Yeah.
Let me see what it actually is.

946
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.410
It got hit and then the pilot didn't come off for like 10 minutes.
That rat,

947
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.270
he let us all sweat and everybody was like scared shitless.
Maybe.

948
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:13.730
Then the pilot came on and he talked like Kissinger.
He was German obviously,

949
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:15.500
but he,
he first,
he didn't German than in English,

950
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.220
but when he spoke in English she sounded like Kissinger,

951
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.980
homos,
and everybody was like,
oh my God,
what's going on here?
But it looks scary.

952
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.180
This is the Turkish airplane hit by lightening strike inside playing video.

953
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.700
But I don't know why there was sparks going at the door.
The doors.
Oh,

954
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.550
they just got hit right there and the lights go out.

955
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:45.270
<v 5>Oh my God,
this is terrifying.
The mountains.</v>

956
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.360
<v 3>Shit's terrifying man.
Shut it off now.
We're going to be nice.</v>

957
00:52:50.361 --> 00:52:53.580
Don't ever put that back on again.
We got to fly everywhere.

958
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.320
I'm flying this weekend is the light together and drive.

959
00:52:58.321 --> 00:53:02.790
Come on man,
man.
Flying through the sky with the fucking gods are angry,

960
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.690
I think.
Did I tell you this one?
If I've told it,

961
00:53:06.691 --> 00:53:10.680
I'll stop and we'd flied out [inaudible] and was on a little plane.

962
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:14.790
Usually you're on a giant plane,
but it was on like a seven 37 you know like

963
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:20.640
a Virgin Australia,
which has a groovy airline.

964
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.990
So on the flight with me and my wife has a,
the game,

965
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.490
<v 2>you know this guy is a rapper,
right?
He's got a tattoo on his head,
whatnot.</v>

966
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:34.140
And Kerry hill then who's also a rapper and a and their posse,
right?

967
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.140
So it's hectic,
right?

968
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:41.210
It starts to get them MP and the pilot comes on and goes like everybody strapped

969
00:53:41.211 --> 00:53:43.080
in.
Okay.
For like ever.

970
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.550
And Australia is 15 hours,
16 minutes long.

971
00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:52.500
It's just the whole day.
And this lasted literally five hours,
right?

972
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.520
Wow.
Just bouncing up and down,
side to side,
pitching yard,
the whole thing.

973
00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.870
And on the,
on the sky map,
right?
It says like Paygo,
Paygo,

974
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.640
1500 kilometers,
meaning your 1500 kilometers from paygo,
paygo.

975
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.410
In other words,
the Pacific Ocean is so big,
there's no land masses,

976
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.250
nothing anywhere near you where you're going over.
Right?

977
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.560
So you're not going to go in because its turbulence,

978
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:18.930
it's not your fucking freaking me out.
You're not going to die.

979
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:23.620
This isn't electricity.
Turbulence doesn't make planes crash and it doesn't,

980
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.360
unless there's some sort of hideous structural defect and the plane like that,

981
00:54:27.361 --> 00:54:28.950
you know,
the wings aren't glued on or whatever.

982
00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:31.230
But I mean a structural defect generally,

983
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.590
generally now you've been in a play with turbulence.
They don't,
you know,

984
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.040
that's not what makes them crashing,
you know.
But anyways,

985
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:43.930
it's terrible in any case.
So we get through it and next morning,
uh,

986
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.670
the rappers get up and they're all like,
oh my God,
I thought I was going to die.

987
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:51.720
And you know,
it was so bad last night I,
you know,
I was praying and La,
la,
la,

988
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:54.840
they're all like really shook up and carry.

989
00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:59.370
Hilton is a very lovely young rapper.
Lady wakes up,

990
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.600
it's been all night.
Mind you,
no one can move.

991
00:55:03.601 --> 00:55:08.370
I stopped holding my wife's hand for five,
you know,
like,
like this for you know,

992
00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.950
cause like this,
oh what happened and the rappers,

993
00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:15.460
cause you didn't feel that we are going to die that night.

994
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.030
Claims by another young woman.
She goes,
I took a pill,

995
00:55:18.031 --> 00:55:21.240
I didn't see anything and beans and motherfucker.
It was an end.

996
00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:24.720
Then she ate one piece of fruit and put on a leopard mini skirt and came at him

997
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:28.350
with her makeup and signed autographs and I was like,
you're a star.

998
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:34.380
I want you on my team.
You are Alexander the Great.

999
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:39.780
We,
everyone was scared.
The adrenaline you could smell in the plane,

1000
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:44.070
you know what I mean?
From five hours of bouncing,
you know,
just that,
oh,
you know,

1001
00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:47.370
you want it to stop,
stop bouncing so we can start producing.

1002
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.340
And she just woke up a word.
Yeah.

1003
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:54.690
Fucking put on a pushup bra getting ready to for the photo call.

1004
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:55.530
When they got off the plane,

1005
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.420
<v 0>I believe he did tell the story.
I remember this,</v>

1006
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:00.960
but I just loved you sat her several.
A Pharaoh was like,
you gotta be kidding me,

1007
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:01.681
man.
Yeah.

1008
00:56:01.681 --> 00:56:04.660
It was either this podcast or another podcast or heard you tell a story.

1009
00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:07.080
It's really,
I remember,
I remember it now after it's over.

1010
00:56:07.081 --> 00:56:11.010
We talked about the girl getting out and changing.
Yeah.
That's a great story.
Wow.

1011
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.360
It's great that someone could be that,
that out cold on ambient.

1012
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.400
So there's positive things to ambien.
I was talking about,
she had about Ambien,

1013
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:19.530
but if ambien can get you to avoid that,

1014
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:23.620
<v 2>not one minute of it.
And it lasted for,
I'm sorry I didn't to repeat it,</v>

1015
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:27.520
but it always made me laugh because I was scared to death and when I got off the

1016
00:56:27.521 --> 00:56:31.210
plane I look like,
you know,
something James Brolin sat on,

1017
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.710
I was squishy and moist.
What's your dams per day?
Yeah.

1018
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:40.930
And it,
you know,
you're,
you're just wracked,
eh.
Uh,
and all I wanted to do is like,

1019
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.110
you know,
eat a club sandwich and die,
you know,
cause you're like,
God,

1020
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:47.110
we're on the ground.
And she just like,
Hey,

1021
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:51.640
who's for pictures?
That's hilarious.

1022
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:56.920
Does something to being oblivious.
Oh,
oblivion.
Is it really?
No,
no brain,

1023
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:57.370
no pain.

1024
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.490
<v 0>I had a friend that was a martial artist and uh,</v>

1025
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.980
he would get like real nervous and you know,

1026
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:07.981
real upset before fights and he couldn't understand why some people wouldn't,

1027
00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:13.300
why the people work like calm and relaxed.
And I said,
you're smarter.
Yeah.

1028
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:15.700
I said,
you know that about the consequences.
You're,

1029
00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:18.670
you're aware of the possibilities are you,
you have more of a burden,

1030
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.440
you have a burden of understanding.

1031
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.540
Whereas this is a bunch of people and here the thing through the baddest mother

1032
00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:24.970
fucker that ever lived,
you know,

1033
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:27.040
you're not the baddest mother fucker that ever did lived,

1034
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:31.960
but you get this strange thrill out of competing and you,
you,

1035
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.750
you find yourself compelled to see how far you can push it,

1036
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:38.110
but you're well aware of the consequences.
So you better be careful,
you know,

1037
00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:40.390
be careful.
You're fucking,
you're smart.
You're thinking.

1038
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.270
That's why people freak out.
The people that don't freak out,

1039
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:46.900
the people that can just skate through that like you don't want that you don't

1040
00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:47.200
want,

1041
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.970
that's more of a burden or the lack of awareness that you get by staying in your

1042
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:53.560
job,
I suppose.
Yes.

1043
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:57.070
But I mean like not being terrified of things that everybody else is terrified.

1044
00:57:57.071 --> 00:57:57.250
Yeah.

1045
00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:01.510
<v 2>Well you can die quicker from it for sure because those people are asking for
it.</v>

1046
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:05.060
That there is certain awesomeness in oblivion that keeps you,
yeah.

1047
00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:09.940
Can you power style?
Well there's the thing about acting to an athletics,
right?

1048
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:11.860
Cause there's,
you know,

1049
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:16.990
like I love a panda on the San Francisco giants that there our third baseman.

1050
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:20.020
Anyone else would tell you to come up to the bat and think about what the

1051
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.680
pitcher's throwing and your chances of hitting it in a certain zone and you want

1052
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:27.940
to put a good swing on it and he seems to just lunge it shit.

1053
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:31.480
It's over his head or down to his ankles and there's no rhyme or reason,

1054
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:32.490
but he's a superb hitter.

1055
00:58:32.491 --> 00:58:35.200
He's got to strengthen the coordination to do it at this point.

1056
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:37.190
And so they manage a cat,

1057
00:58:37.191 --> 00:58:41.470
say anything when he calls one right into the stands,
off his ankles on a pitch.

1058
00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:43.480
You should surely be laying off of that.

1059
00:58:43.481 --> 00:58:46.900
Any coach would be up your Dick for fucking offering on,
you know what I mean?

1060
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.540
There's a certain amount of oblivion to that that I just think,

1061
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:51.730
well that's the kind of player you are.
You know,

1062
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:55.090
there's that babe Ruth quality of like,
fuck you.
I drank 20 beers,

1063
00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:56.020
I fucked three girls.

1064
00:58:56.021 --> 00:58:59.740
I eight five hot dogs and I hit a home or what the fuck's your problem?
Well,

1065
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:00.790
it's also,
I think

1066
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.690
<v 0>there's not the same consequences that there is with fighting.
You know,</v>

1067
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.300
fighting using sucks.
Yeah.
But the people that have no concern whatsoever,

1068
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:14.020
genuinely have no concerns,
they're dangerous or they're in trouble too.

1069
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:16.900
They're there not just dangerous.
They're in trouble.
Cause you gotta be,

1070
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.960
you have to be scared.
Literally your,
your reflex is,

1071
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:22.070
won't be tuned in correctly if you're not

1072
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.130
<v 1>scared,
you really shouldn't compete unless you have some nerves.</v>

1073
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.520
You really should feel it.
Otherwise it's dangerous.

1074
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:31.220
Like guys get cracked sometimes when they're overconfident because they go into

1075
00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:33.860
a fight thinking that this isn't a threat.

1076
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.740
When it's a huge threat and the other person's on full threat,

1077
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.610
the other person's fully adrenaline Dava and they're moving it like,
you know,

1078
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:44.630
40% faster than they ever would in real life.
And you're not,
you know?
Right.

1079
00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.700
And then you're going to get kicked in the head.
Yes.

1080
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:49.160
You're not going to see it coming.
You're not alert.
You're not scared.

1081
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:50.300
So you're not level,

1082
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:55.340
you're not moving quickly or you're not like really amped up.
You're not totally,

1083
00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.570
it's very important and it's really difficult for stupid people.

1084
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.890
Stupid people have,
if nothing's happened to them yet,
they think they're fine.

1085
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.090
They're in vulnerable.
What about him performing?
I find like a,

1086
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.190
a friend of mine said to me years ago,

1087
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:13.370
you get a script and this is just a lane premise,

1088
01:00:13.371 --> 01:00:16.880
but you get the idea like it's an audition and it's not a very funny scene,

1089
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:19.490
right?
You're smart enough to look at it.
One,

1090
01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.010
because you have a sense of humor and chill.

1091
01:00:21.011 --> 01:00:24.610
Your intelligent to look at and go the scenes sucky.

1092
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.400
I gotta do something with it,
whereas a stupid or actor looks at it and goes,
man,

1093
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:30.320
that's hilarious.
Right?

1094
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:34.130
The barrier of like the editorial commenting,
you know,

1095
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.580
also people get really delusion with anything that they're involved in or

1096
01:00:37.581 --> 01:00:38.930
anything that they want to get.

1097
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:42.020
They start thinking it's much better than it really is.
I've had friends tell me,

1098
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:45.220
oh my God,
dude,
there's this pilot we're filming.
You got to read the script.

1099
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.710
It's fucking hilarious.
And then you read it,
you're like,
oh my God,
this is shite.

1100
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.480
It's lessons shite on a stick.
Yeah,
you shouldn't do this.
You turn this down.

1101
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.840
I turned them down.
Now when something comes up that's really,
really,

1102
01:00:56.841 --> 01:01:00.260
I don't even read for it.
I just like,
I can't,
I don't get offered anything.

1103
01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:03.380
But it would,
if I did,
I'd have morals and that attorney,
the only,

1104
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.250
the only acting I've done it all in the last few years has been with Kevin
James,

1105
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:10.700
Kevin jammies.
Just cause he's such a nice guy.
He's such a sweetie.

1106
01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:12.200
I love being around them.
And you know,

1107
01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:17.201
he's a pal from our early days of a comedy in her twenties but other than that,

1108
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:22.610
like auditioning for things and preparing food basics,
I missed that boat.

1109
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:25.350
It's too much work.
It's a lot of work.
Too much.

1110
01:01:25.351 --> 01:01:29.960
So when we can create our own little wizard realm,
I don't know why.

1111
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.270
I don't want,
the stress of it is so horrible.

1112
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.990
You wouldn't have as much fun in a movie as you would do in a podcast.

1113
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:39.560
And I never have as much wind doing anything.
It's idea that having podcasts,
no,

1114
01:01:39.561 --> 01:01:40.490
I'm serious.
Bad.

1115
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:44.230
You're killing in front of all these people live creating things on the left

1116
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.600
more than anything you've ever,
I mean I stand up in podcasting,

1117
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.300
both my favorite things ever,

1118
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.440
but anymore just to being able to even control it to this level that we are now.

1119
01:01:56.931 --> 01:02:01.320
When we look at,
look at what,
15 years ago?
Yeah.

1120
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.260
We couldn't have done it.
No we could,

1121
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.230
we wouldn't have never got hired by radio stations.
Neither one of us.

1122
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.650
And now we're,
we're our own crappy radio station.
That's great.
Yeah.

1123
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.410
I mean I had always thought about doing radio.

1124
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:13.910
I always thought it would be really fun,

1125
01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:16.640
but there was always that they tell you what to say.

1126
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.920
Oh you got to do with a program or cause like every time we did a morning show

1127
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:22.700
there was always,
well it's fucking new executives and asshole.

1128
01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:25.920
He won't let us talk about tampons on the air.
Like you can't say this,

1129
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:30.180
you can't say the r word.
Remember the Joe Show a little Austin,
was that?
Yeah.

1130
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:32.310
Dale Dale and Bob Dale.
Dudley.

1131
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.300
That was right when you weren't allowed to say retarded anymore.
Well,

1132
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:39.840
they had a bunch of rules that they were having.
I think when we would go on,

1133
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:43.980
the first couple of times I went on and was sorta hog wild and then as time went

1134
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:48.240
on they pulled back on that.
Well,
radio is changing.
It's not,

1135
01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:52.140
there's not a lot of like,
there's used to be just in Boston alone,

1136
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:55.440
there was a series of morning Djs for rock stations.

1137
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:59.970
There was Charles Laquidara,
there was the guys on Aaf who the Hillman now.

1138
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:04.230
There was,
there was all these different revive station,
classic rock station.

1139
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.620
Everybody knew them.
Everybody knew the Djs is mark Parenteau,

1140
01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:09.870
who's the afternoon guy in Boston.
Everybody knew.

1141
01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:12.990
These guys tell big dice to pieces,
man,
they're competing with us.
Dot.

1142
01:03:12.991 --> 01:03:14.820
To be honest,
because they have to do podcasts.

1143
01:03:14.821 --> 01:03:18.150
If they're ready or she has to and stuff or they're going for older demo.

1144
01:03:18.151 --> 01:03:23.151
I find myself on a Lotta easy listening or more classic he pop type things that

1145
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:25.650
have the bigger,
broader reach.
Where now,

1146
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:28.680
where it used to be that guy show now three or four other guys who had their own

1147
01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:32.850
shows are all on that show too and
glom together.

1148
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.940
Well a lot of radio stations offer like a supplemental podcast.

1149
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:39.420
Now I know Kevin and being do that opie and Anthony do that.

1150
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:40.600
They have a podcast too.

1151
01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:45.330
If you titans like Bob and Tom have an empire in the Midwest.
Yeah.
You all,
yeah,

1152
01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:47.010
no those guys could still do it.

1153
01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:49.920
Kevin and being could still do it but it's less than less man.

1154
01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:52.940
It used to be like there was thousands of them,
you know,

1155
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.090
three or four in San Francisco just alone just in San Francisco and that's a

1156
01:03:57.091 --> 01:04:00.270
small market.
Right.
And then now there's one,

1157
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:04.740
two and it cut back on what the east to let you be on an hour and now we
changed.

1158
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:06.600
We want people to listen to more,
you know,

1159
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:10.500
crappy music or whatever that they think if you not delivering joke,
joke,
joke,

1160
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:12.480
joke,
joke,
joke,
joke.
People are not going to tune in.

1161
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.120
They want to give you like a real quick like five minute interview.

1162
01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:16.110
And then you're on your way and you're like,

1163
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.970
I got up at five in the morning for this,

1164
01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:20.970
let me stop for half an hour and I'll light it up.
Light it.
Yeah,

1165
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:24.390
let's have some fun.
And they used to be that you could go on and be,
you can,

1166
01:04:24.391 --> 01:04:27.970
you can do a lot of local radio.
We do two,
three hours and sit with them.

1167
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.900
Just have fun.
And you would be in with them for the morning and they'd be like,

1168
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:32.130
can you stick around?
You'd be like,
yeah.

1169
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:34.290
And he's there till 10 o'clock and everybody's laughing.

1170
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.290
You'd shake hands is a lot of fun.
Y'All had a good time together.

1171
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:39.600
But those places are few and far between these days.

1172
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:42.060
They're really thin on the ground now.
Yeah,
it's probably,

1173
01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:45.810
they've lost half their ranks and that's my gas is they lost and they had to

1174
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:48.990
consolidate and they're owned by smaller and smaller.
Yeah.

1175
01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:53.130
Owner base and the old when we're starting,
and we're talking a while ago,

1176
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:56.670
there was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of radio stations owned by

1177
01:04:56.671 --> 01:05:00.450
different people and now how many people open,

1178
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:03.630
how many corporations own most of them yet for three?
Well,

1179
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:07.620
when we're talking about audible.com earlier in the portable personal MP three

1180
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:08.454
player,

1181
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:12.960
once that sort of integrated and it started becoming an option that you could

1182
01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:16.890
play whatever you want it to on your phone and then you could just listen to it

1183
01:05:16.891 --> 01:05:21.760
on car.
God Damn,
everything changed.
The whole thing just dropped off.

1184
01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.930
I bet people started burning cds and they got online of all the music they

1185
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:28.240
wanted to listen to and then they're like,

1186
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:32.170
well how do we replace this fucking talking thing?
And then boom,
podcast show up.

1187
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.580
Yeah.
It's,
we live in very Trans Trans Dental,

1188
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.630
transcendental transitionary,
transgender,
transgender,
very transgender.

1189
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.980
My friends on both sides,
both sides of the fence.

1190
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.580
Pro All sides.
Yeah.
I think,
um,

1191
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.690
w we live in the weirdest time ever as far as like things changing.
Thank God.

1192
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.170
I think it,
it changed.
It made me love everything again.

1193
01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.210
We were talking about Google glass really,

1194
01:05:58.211 --> 01:06:01.540
and it's gotten me to thinking there was a video online of a guy was attacked by

1195
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:06.400
a shark and he lost his arm and his leg and they made them these wicked carbon

1196
01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:10.990
fiber.
A bionic parts.
It was like walking around.
Yeah.
Pull that guy up.

1197
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:16.230
Australian man bitten by shark has a cyborg arm and a leg.

1198
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:21.070
I mean,
I think I've met this guy.
He was a policeman.
Really?

1199
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.950
And he was on the bomb squad,
was it?
No,
I mean,

1200
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:27.910
I'm sure if I met a guy four years ago,
three years ago,

1201
01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:33.010
and he had a prosthetic hand that it and it,
you know,
like it was a black,

1202
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.970
the black thingy.
I met a guy who has a prosthetic hand as well.

1203
01:06:36.971 --> 01:06:41.680
The same kind of hand at the global future,
20,
45 initiative in New York.
Wow.

1204
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:46.050
Is this a future trends?
You know,
all it was all this um,
uh,

1205
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.820
the transcendental man movie stuff.
That's cute.
Cute.
You know,

1206
01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:51.490
all their Kurtzweil stuff,
all this stuff about extending life.

1207
01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:56.050
And this guy had lost his hand and they had given him this bionic recreation of

1208
01:06:56.051 --> 01:06:59.380
a hand and it was carbon fiber and he would shake your hand with it and it was

1209
01:06:59.381 --> 01:07:03.490
pliable and he could,
he could,
you know,
apply varying levels of resistance.

1210
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:06.650
And it's really interesting to say,
but what I thought about,
I was like,
well,

1211
01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.230
absolutely,
it'd be better to have that than to have you know.
No hand,
right?
Yeah.

1212
01:07:11.231 --> 01:07:13.580
Here's a guy right here.
This is the guy that was not him.

1213
01:07:13.581 --> 01:07:15.800
It will be the best way to defend ourselves against,

1214
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.840
he lost his one arm and one leg to a shark movie.

1215
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.230
It was on the side by see if he could pull ahead and he shows it.
He shows his,

1216
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:28.960
uh,
arm and his leg and you get a chance to see,
I mean,

1217
01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:32.470
the guy's walking around and standing there like,
you know,

1218
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.180
he's part robot man.

1219
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.300
And what I was thinking is it's absolutely better to have that than not have

1220
01:07:37.301 --> 01:07:40.570
your hand,
we,
but we all agree,
right?
We would definitely want that.

1221
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.580
But a prosthesis leg,
see his leg.
It's so cool.

1222
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:49.330
He's got balance.
You can walk.
It's awesome.
It's totally awesome.

1223
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.780
Now here's the question.
What if they could do that to your whole body?

1224
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.770
<v 2>How does your body,
exactly.
We're going to start doing parts though.</v>

1225
01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:57.090
I think they're going to start with like eyes.

1226
01:07:57.091 --> 01:07:59.710
Like you're going to have night vision,
Zoom Lens in your idea.

1227
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.280
You're going to have an article.
Here's something to consider for you.

1228
01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:05.390
I really haven't type fans of Scifi.
Uh,

1229
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.820
what about when the rich get onto the poor and start farming them for parts and

1230
01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:12.610
then basically have your head put on a poor person's body.
She can afford it,
man.

1231
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.060
Yeah,
because you paid that family this much and they fucking

1232
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.390
<v 3>dealer one of the uncles.</v>

1233
01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:20.870
If you don't think they're already jumped to that with Oregon's and every other

1234
01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:22.820
goddamn thinking in the world.
Well,
sure.
I mean that,

1235
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:25.700
wasn't that movie hostile about that or was it about torture

1236
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.340
<v 0>or just torturing people?
I think,
but I think,
um,
you know,</v>

1237
01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:32.460
there's been a million of those urban legends of someone hanging out with a

1238
01:08:32.461 --> 01:08:36.240
Russian check and waking up in a bathtub filled with ice with stitches and a

1239
01:08:36.241 --> 01:08:38.340
note on you.
This is go to the doctor immediately.

1240
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.440
<v 3>Yeah,
he kept on telling me that in Japan you're like,</v>

1241
01:08:40.441 --> 01:08:44.230
stay away from those Russians.
Brian,
they'll harvest jargons,

1242
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.000
man who you don't want to get involved with the mercenary Russian hooker who has

1243
01:08:48.001 --> 01:08:51.510
also has a scalpel in her purse.
That's really good advice.

1244
01:08:51.511 --> 01:08:53.610
And a wet rag she's trying to show in your mouth.

1245
01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.410
Cause one thing I've learned from Joe today,

1246
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:59.600
smell my perfume is intoxicating.
No,

1247
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.110
the room,
he seems to be getting smaller.
Does it not?

1248
01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.760
Well I do look so dizzy blind and this sweet Boosie Boosie anymore.

1249
01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.620
You'll get things sleepy before you like me.
Like me.

1250
01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:20.790
Once you smell my perfume.
Oh two bed to bed.
I take your liver,

1251
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.920
I think your kidney.

1252
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.950
<v 0>Yeah,
they,</v>

1253
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:29.580
she pricks you on the finger earlier in the day to get your blood type.

1254
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:33.120
Then they set up the coolers,
coolers full of ice,

1255
01:09:33.121 --> 01:09:36.270
and fucking put a wet rag over your face and open you up like a,

1256
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.970
like a dolphin on a deck in Japan,

1257
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.820
<v 3>slice and then got your liver or whatnot.</v>

1258
01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.380
And rich guy lives forever.

1259
01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:49.480
<v 0>Yeah.
People will kill people for money.
We all know that.
Right?
Well,</v>

1260
01:09:49.481 --> 01:09:51.730
people will definitely steal people's organs for money.

1261
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:55.070
<v 3>Oh yeah,
they will.
Oh,
we gotta be careful that my shows,</v>

1262
01:09:56.750 --> 01:10:00.560
there's a lot of people looking for kidneys and whatnot.
A lot of pancreas,

1263
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:04.430
pancreas Steve's.
I got a guy tried to steal my iro Langer hands.

1264
01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:07.100
Thank God I wasn't sitting.
What is that?
I don't know.

1265
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:10.040
It's just some Oregon that's happening here.
All up in your thingy.

1266
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:13.110
That's an actual organ.
Yeah,
that just loved the name of that process.

1267
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.600
You have a Google there.
Try selling the use of Langur hands.

1268
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:21.170
I think it's a little gland up in your urethra area,
your reader area.

1269
01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.840
<v 0>If they could give you cadaver dicks,
if dudes could get to cadaver Dick's.</v>

1270
01:10:24.841 --> 01:10:28.950
Like if you were born with a week Dick,
and you always want a big Dick,

1271
01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:32.310
but there's just the only way he could get one cadaver Dick's and it turns out

1272
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:35.250
they don't use cadavers.
Dicks they use like,
you know,

1273
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.510
ligaments for knee replacements.
Like I had one of those done with a dabber part.

1274
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:42.750
They use Oregon's,
you can be an organ donor but you can't be a dick donor.

1275
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:45.990
How can we can't be a dick donor if they could do that shit with hands.

1276
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:49.080
What if a dude has like a really tiny deck and he's willing to take a chance?

1277
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.850
They really get it down pat,

1278
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.480
do you think that one day like motorcycle victims will donate their dicks?

1279
01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:57.660
I'll give you a motorcycle rider.
You're crazy dude.

1280
01:10:57.661 --> 01:11:00.990
But you've got a giant deck and you know it's valuable so you get a break on

1281
01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:01.824
your taxes.

1282
01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:06.360
<v 3>I just,
I donated mine.
I have the gender card for Costa Rica.</v>

1283
01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.870
The whole country gets to share mine cause it's pretty big the whole country.

1284
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.430
A lot of people in Costa Rica,
Bro.
Stop bragging.
Well,
it's a small country.

1285
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.140
I'm known as El Guapo there.
It's not like you said China.
Yeah,

1286
01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.570
they get the whole,
all the Chinese could share.
My Dick did it.

1287
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.980
Did we define what the olive lagger hand did?
I don't think,

1288
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:30.030
I don't know if it has a specific purpose,
but it's a,
I have to Pete,

1289
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.780
thank you for that sharing and that I just wanted to let you know I'm,
I'm,

1290
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.200
I do too,
but I'll go after you.

1291
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:40.380
<v 4>You didn't.
The pancreas that contain a whatever.
Wow.</v>

1292
01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:42.810
That's pretty vague.
Well,
it doesn't really say what it does.

1293
01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:44.390
It just says it's in there.
It's,
yeah.

1294
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.460
I don't know that it has a specific function,
but I love the name.

1295
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.130
Why is it an aisle and who's Mr Langer hand?
Yeah,
it's weird.
Oh,

1296
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:57.120
look at this picture.
Oh no,
that's alright.
That there it is.
Where is it?

1297
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.130
I don't know.
I just,
it looks like a Dick.

1298
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:05.490
I don't know why that has anything to do with it.

1299
01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:09.480
It doesn't say anything on there.
Whatever.

1300
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:13.890
Diabetes.
Okay,
great.

1301
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:15.240
Do you have any tour dates you want to

1302
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.930
<v 3>flood?
I guess at this point in the show I should really,</v>

1303
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.080
I have a video coming out on,
uh,
March 26 you can go to my website,

1304
01:12:25.081 --> 01:12:29.310
Greg proops.com and you can preorder it now.
It's live at Musso and frank,

1305
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.340
I came on to plug it last year.
You may recall Brian,
but um,

1306
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.330
that company folded the week that we were supposed to drop the video.

1307
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:37.820
<v 4>Right?
What,
what was that again?</v>

1308
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.620
<v 3>Well,
that was chill,
nevermind them.
Uh,</v>

1309
01:12:40.621 --> 01:12:43.830
and it was through no fault of theirs in a way.
But in any case,
uh,
uh,

1310
01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.830
now it's going to come out again.
Yeah,
there you are.
There's my website.

1311
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:50.390
See that thing,
that banner there?
You can click on that and you can order it.

1312
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.150
The member of the video is add May.
Last year she'll run out of business.

1313
01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:57.870
The week it was supposed to drop.
And so now it's coming out again on March 26th,

1314
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.680
but you can preorder it now.
So what happened?
Showing out of business,

1315
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.940
they bit coined it.
Yeah.
So for 99 years and if you,
uh,

1316
01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.530
if you use the code proofs,
uh,
you get for I think $4,

1317
01:13:11.531 --> 01:13:15.670
so it's really,
wow,
it's four bucks.
It's an hour long video.
I made it.

1318
01:13:15.671 --> 01:13:18.370
It's coming out much 26.
It's a lie that Musso and Frank's,

1319
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:20.320
thank goodness it wasn't topical material.

1320
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:25.180
It was evergreen material that I think both boys and girls and men and women

1321
01:13:25.181 --> 01:13:28.180
alike can relate to.
Um,
I'm joking.

1322
01:13:28.181 --> 01:13:31.540
Of course boys and girls and boys and girls,
no one's going to be uncomfortable.

1323
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:34.570
No,
I think everyone will be uncomfortable and that's my goal.

1324
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:37.480
That's as good as Tom Lehrer once said,
if I could make a loved one,

1325
01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:41.560
slap another level and then it's all been worthwhile for me as a comedian.
Um,

1326
01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.910
<v 0>dom Irrera and I talked about you putting your show on at Musso and Frank's,</v>

1327
01:13:45.911 --> 01:13:48.160
we both agreed it's such a brilliant idea.

1328
01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:52.180
It's like the perfect place because it's got this beautiful old Hollywood

1329
01:13:52.181 --> 01:13:55.090
feeling to it.
Like it's a great place to eat.

1330
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:59.200
It's like sort of like I'm the one place on Santa Monica Boulevard,

1331
01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:00.130
the steakhouse

1332
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:01.530
<v 3>palms.
No.</v>

1333
01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:06.531
The other one then Cantana I laughed at that place has got that same sort of

1334
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:12.040
school,
Hollywood and great food.
Musso and Frank's end.
Yeah.
So when

1335
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.700
<v 1>I heard that you were doing it there,
I was like,
God,</v>

1336
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:16.540
grains Santana did a great place to put it on the sheet would be,

1337
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.850
it was just really fun.
But anyway,
we're finally coming out with a,

1338
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:24.010
it's just taken,
so you know,
it's one of those journeys.
Is it available now?

1339
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.300
You can preorder it now.
If you click that thing on my site,

1340
01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:30.290
[inaudible] dot com I have add and then,
um,

1341
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.850
it'll come out on the 26th and then you'll be able to watch it immediately.

1342
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.630
And yes,

1343
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:38.470
people watching in Australia and England and Ireland and all of the Joe Rogan

1344
01:14:38.471 --> 01:14:42.010
heirs,
uh,
of those bold Rogan errors all over the world.
Uh,

1345
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.450
you may watch it as well.

1346
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:46.880
It is simply downloadable to whatever device you've got.
And like I say,

1347
01:14:46.881 --> 01:14:51.070
if you read proofs in the little code there,
I love,
it's 20% off with $5.
Well,

1348
01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:55.680
20% off or $5 is a dollar.
I'll make it real bloody simple for everybody.

1349
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:59.620
Sound as good.
20% sounds juicy or 20% is a lot.
It is a lot,

1350
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:03.600
but with $5 it's really $4 so it's very reasonable.
And we should,

1351
01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:08.320
we both have to thank Louis Ck for coming up with this idea.
I totally,
yeah,

1352
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.820
I know you do.
I do to everybody does.
It's a beautiful idea that he came up with,

1353
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:16.360
I'm hoping it works and we put out our podcasts for free and you don't have to

1354
01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:19.450
pay for them.
And so people sometimes in on the end and you're like,

1355
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.250
how can I help you or whatever.

1356
01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:25.600
And it's like well spend the $4 on this and that would be a nice way to,
yeah,

1357
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:26.620
that's a nice thing to do.

1358
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.660
I support like if I found out about a good music or find a song that I really

1359
01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:36.640
enjoy it,
I buy it at a principal.
I always need Joe.
And if I enjoy it,

1360
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.490
especially if I,
you know,
someone sends me a youtube clip or something like that.

1361
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:43.690
If you get good feelings from someone's art,
if you can support it,

1362
01:15:43.691 --> 01:15:47.460
you should support it.
And I totally understand that people are broke.
Oh,
me too.

1363
01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.100
Thanks free.
Don't spend money on me man.
Before you,
you know,

1364
01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:53.950
I should be at the end of your list,
but you know,

1365
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.980
if you want to go buy a tank phone,
go and go get a Tang.
If you wanna join,

1366
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.990
push you out.
Help out some of those sponsors.
Oh,

1367
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:05.560
you said I'm playing tonight at the bar I live at and that's free.

1368
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.530
Where's that at?
I live,
which is our now Santa Monica Boulevard,
uh,
right near,
um,

1369
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:13.240
uh,
like the Formosa.
What would you say?
It's close.

1370
01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:15.940
It's across street from the pleasure chest.
You brands people.

1371
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:19.240
You're a crafty bastard and it's free to come to that.
That's my podcast.

1372
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.760
Seven o'clock till you crafty and how you move,
man.
I like,

1373
01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:25.300
how are you doing shows in these,
a unorthodox locations.
Oh,

1374
01:16:25.301 --> 01:16:28.910
everybody plays a part.
Lubitsch yet.
Josh and Josh has his show there.
And uh,

1375
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.320
not everybody man.
Well,
some people that's,
it's,
it's unorthodox.

1376
01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:36.220
It's fairly an orthotic.
The laugh factory.
It's not the Improv.
No,
I can't,

1377
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:39.990
you know,
it's,
it's got a little back room and there's a VOD compile out frank.

1378
01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.030
Uh,
so,
and there's a little patio up front so you can get your story of,
you know,

1379
01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:46.360
the,
I mean it has its full service.
How big is the room?
Oh,
Janky.

1380
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:50.900
What would you say?
50,
50,
60 shows there.

1381
01:16:50.901 --> 01:16:54.910
That's how you see a little red cushions.
And there's always lots of women.

1382
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:58.810
It's a very women friendly atmosphere.
It's not that duty.
You know,
it's,

1383
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:02.860
it's pretty chill.
And go there,
dude.
How do you,
uh,
who books that shit?

1384
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.060
I'll get you on it.
I'll give you the right sounds.
Awesome.
I love,

1385
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.590
I love that little room at the Ice House.
That's my current favorite room.

1386
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.890
That little 80 seat room.
Yes.
You know,

1387
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.890
I don't usually do the big room,
which is still awesome.

1388
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.800
It's only 150 but that little room,
God damn,

1389
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.860
that little room is magical for coming up with new material.

1390
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.550
It's like the crowd like totally lets you know what's funny about it and what's

1391
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:29.180
not.
There's not a lot.
There's a weird fluff that you get.

1392
01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:31.820
Like you get extra laughs when you get like 300 people.

1393
01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.940
Like did get people that like get into a rhythm and I start laughing at anything

1394
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.880
and he seen you get confused.
It's whether or not a bit is good or not,

1395
01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:41.220
but 80 people will give you the fucking real deal though.

1396
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.650
They'll kick you the real deal.
Um,

1397
01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:48.950
Marshall Child's room in Atlanta called the laughing skull.
Yes.

1398
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:53.630
Love that place.
And that's
not working there.

1399
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:56.180
It's not working.
But when it's working it's working.
Well,
you know,

1400
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:59.600
even that is fat compared to what we used to do at the store.

1401
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:03.410
The beautiful thing about the store is that if there was two fucking people in

1402
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:06.240
that place,
you did a show for two people.
I did that.

1403
01:18:06.241 --> 01:18:08.960
A danger fields to danger fields in Minot and needs to be like that.

1404
01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.480
They would have two people would walk in and the MC would start the show like

1405
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.390
the nine 30 there was no show going on.

1406
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:18.050
The comics are waiting by the bar and at the store,

1407
01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:20.840
as long as there's people still sitting down,
it's two o'clock in the morning.

1408
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:23.960
You might have to go up and perform for two fucking people.

1409
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:26.210
And it's super common.
Like,
you know,

1410
01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:29.370
like once a week there'll be a show like that.
Oh well you,

1411
01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:33.690
you could possibly have a late spot and there's no one in the audience.
Right.

1412
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.790
And Don Berry every night.

1413
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:39.740
He had one person the other day and he spent like 20 minutes on that person that

1414
01:18:39.741 --> 01:18:43.160
made that prison that night I got the back roads,
all comics,
you know,

1415
01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:47.330
it's beautiful.
Dawn barristers.
What does comedy though?
Yes,
it is comedy.

1416
01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:52.040
And it's also,
again,
you,
you cut all the fat out when it's a tiny ass.

1417
01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:57.170
That's all I,
other than in mortality is Shakespeare said is all I seek.

1418
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:59.300
All I seek is you want that connection.

1419
01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:04.280
And so I like a little rim and I like alcohol.
A small room.
Real closeup.

1420
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:09.140
I don't,
I don't,
uh,
I love Vic ran.
Then you know,
you throw javelins and you know,

1421
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:12.740
you got to make big faces and you got a big g big gestures and you,

1422
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:15.430
you're doing a different show.
It's a different show.

1423
01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.450
That's the small room you can incubate,
you can raise your eyebrow,
you can,

1424
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:20.870
you can intimate.

1425
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.590
You don't have to fucking lay down and suppressing fire to keep the aliens from

1426
01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:27.680
killing you.
I like both.
This is what I like.

1427
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:31.610
I like for developing material.
I like a little tiny show.

1428
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:34.640
I look a little tiny room for fucking around like a little tiny room,

1429
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.350
but I just don't like doing places like the Chicago theater or like Massey Hall,

1430
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.170
like those really big places.
There's something,

1431
01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:47.220
a lecture Yale about 3000 plus people that are laughing their asses off and

1432
01:19:47.811 --> 01:19:51.110
having a great time and it's like you're so on point.

1433
01:19:51.111 --> 01:19:55.100
You're so like tuned into them because there's so much density in the air.

1434
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.220
But I think that is a different show.

1435
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:01.790
It's a different show than you would do in a cloud.
It's a big louder.
Yeah,

1436
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:06.140
it's much loud and you can't just leave dead air out there the same way because

1437
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:07.980
it will just start yelling shit out.
There's

1438
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.530
<v 0>just too many people that are drinking and having fun.</v>

1439
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:13.800
And there's that diffusion of responsibility that takes place when you've got

1440
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:17.760
massive groups like that,
like people feel less responsible for the fun.

1441
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.850
Like if there's two people in the crowd,
no one's going to stand up and go

1442
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:21.983
<v 6>foggy.</v>

1443
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.720
<v 0>No.
But if you're in the middle of some 3000 seat place,</v>

1444
01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:32.070
some asshole might do that.
Yeah.

1445
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.870
He might get lit up and want to be the center of it.

1446
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.810
<v 2>That's true.
Now when there's two people,</v>

1447
01:20:36.811 --> 01:20:39.300
there's a lot more assumption of responsibility.
Yeah.

1448
01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:42.570
They can't look at energy for Beth.
But I think for the podcast,
for me,

1449
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.900
I like it like the Bar Lubitsch energy because it is small.

1450
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:50.910
And last time we did it,
there wasn't very many people.
That was maybe
20.

1451
01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.240
And I and I had a great time.
You know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,
you don't,

1452
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.070
you don't need a giant crowd.
It's,
it's fun to,
uh,
also I don't,

1453
01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.220
when you're doing a podcast to you,
you're,

1454
01:21:01.221 --> 01:21:05.010
you're always thinking about people are listening individually.

1455
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:08.130
People aren't sitting like in a Scifi movie from the 70s,

1456
01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:10.470
all in a giant room listening to a speaker.

1457
01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:14.460
Although it'd be great if people had to listen that way.

1458
01:21:14.461 --> 01:21:15.960
Like in the movie colossus,

1459
01:21:15.961 --> 01:21:19.920
the Fob in project where when the computer took over the world,

1460
01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:22.680
finally it adjust the world and it's like I am colossus.

1461
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:25.260
And then there was a montage of like in China,

1462
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:29.280
a bunch of people standing all in a huge group listening to a speaker,
you know,

1463
01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:33.510
and then in England and whatnot,
ice 11,
the Scifi movies when they would do that,

1464
01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:36.750
when they divide the world up for that big world domination message.

1465
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.540
<v 0>I was going to say,
when we're talking about lightening earlier,</v>

1466
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:44.190
that the other thing that I would love to have no knowledge of and experience,

1467
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.590
it was the war of the worlds broadcast.

1468
01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:51.120
Oh Orson Welles did to be in that time,
this fearful,

1469
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:56.121
strange time where you really did think that this person on the radio must be

1470
01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.430
telling the truth because that's how they got on the radio.
Yeah,

1471
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.560
I mean there were so fucking childlike and this idea that this hg wells book,

1472
01:22:04.381 --> 01:22:09.381
a pretty famous book being read by a pretty famous guy and Orson Welles that

1473
01:22:09.451 --> 01:22:10.830
somehow or another this was real.

1474
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.480
<v 2>Well they,</v>

1475
01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.530
they did at the beginning of course came on like it was regular mercury theater,

1476
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.450
but then the style that they did the show in was documentary style salad.

1477
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.850
They took the premise,
so it would be like a novel going,

1478
01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:28.310
Y'all reportive and Glover's mills and [inaudible] in the field and Grovers

1479
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:31.110
Gloversville Josie,
what you hear behind me is maintained.
So there's no video.

1480
01:22:31.111 --> 01:22:35.580
You just hear people doing that and I and shit like that.

1481
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.530
And then people being interviewed,
I'm like,
oh yeah,

1482
01:22:37.531 --> 01:22:40.260
they were coming down the road.
Like that's how they did the radio show.

1483
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:44.670
So it totally worked as theater and the pointless,
everybody tuned in late.

1484
01:22:44.671 --> 01:22:47.910
I remember I said to my dad,
who was old enough to remember that show,
uh,

1485
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.330
what about the people who lived in New Jersey?
I said,
cause he was in Brooklyn.

1486
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.920
I said,
but the people who lived in New Jersey,

1487
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:56.220
surely they knew that it wasn't happening around me when they were the most

1488
01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:01.221
scared of all because they could hear it on the radio happening down the street.

1489
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:05.530
And people were literally,
that's where all the calls came from.
Was

1490
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.730
<v 3>that part of the east coast where,</v>

1491
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:11.350
and then people started to think they see saw of course things,
you know.

1492
01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:14.920
Well that's a huge issue with such a brilliant way to do the show.

1493
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:19.921
That to pitch it over to news style in 1938 to two dad,

1494
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:22.510
the wherewithal,
the not like you say,

1495
01:23:22.511 --> 01:23:26.620
they didn't go like the Martians were coming.
They made it immediate.

1496
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.870
We're under attack and so brilliant motherfucker.

1497
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.840
He was so ahead of his time as well.
You know,
his first of all,

1498
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:40.030
I mean his,
his delivery the way he did that was brilliant.

1499
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:43.990
The way he set that up was brilliant.
Um,
the,
the impact that it had,

1500
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:47.890
but then when he did citizen Kane and now he does,
which didn't win best picture,

1501
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.970
knocked it out of the park with this fucking movie and then started doing wine

1502
01:23:51.971 --> 01:23:55.540
commercials,
dropped off and got fal.

1503
01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:58.660
He's praised careers all over the yard.
He's kind of crazy,
right?

1504
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:02.950
They gave him a lot of many and he tried to do heart of darkness by Conrad and

1505
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:06.700
he went to South America and shot all this weird footage and [inaudible] never

1506
01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:10.020
really pulled it together on that project.
And I think at that point there,

1507
01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.240
that's when the funding sort of dried up halfway through.
You know,

1508
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:16.410
you can't apocalypse now at some time.
Well he did it.
He,
he,

1509
01:24:16.411 --> 01:24:19.870
he's the original apocalypse now or I mean he really did go to South America and

1510
01:24:19.871 --> 01:24:22.750
tried to shoot this thing and like they were going to do,
you know,

1511
01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:27.520
the definitive version that was really subversive and really subliminal and you

1512
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:30.750
know,
we'll make it this scary ass.
Cause if you know,

1513
01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.070
apocalypse is a version of heart of darkness,

1514
01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:36.820
but if you've ever read heart of darkness speaks to something that's immediate

1515
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:37.451
to this world,

1516
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:42.451
which is how we as colonials go in and take over other little nations and turn

1517
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:46.410
them into,
you know,
the horror and all that.
Yeah.

1518
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.520
You can forget how good that movie is.

1519
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:51.300
You go back and watch apocalypse now and you're like,
oh,
I like,

1520
01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.060
oh it's fucking brilliant.
It's pretentious.
But it is really brilliant.

1521
01:24:55.061 --> 01:24:57.490
Well for the time,
I don't think it was pretentious.

1522
01:24:57.491 --> 01:25:00.700
I think it was bold for the timing.
It was two,
he spent a four,

1523
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:03.190
you know what it was,
I think it costs about 35 million then.

1524
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.850
And those days that was considered an obscene amount of money and it didn't have

1525
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.200
to take like seven years to make herself.
God,

1526
01:25:09.201 --> 01:25:11.260
he took a couple of years to make easily.
Yeah.

1527
01:25:11.261 --> 01:25:14.830
And there was a huge delay in Marlon Brando and fucking crazy.
And he got so fat.

1528
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.820
They had a film in black from the neck up.
I mean,
what other big name actor,

1529
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.960
like Marlon Brando was ever in a movie that's that gigantic and all you see is

1530
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:23.860
his neck up.

1531
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:29.490
They really don't focus on his body much and he still murders it.

1532
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:34.240
Yeah,
he does murders it.
Did you ever see the redux?
There's couple good scenes.

1533
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.310
I didn't think they needed to add everything back.

1534
01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:37.690
I thought it was better the way it was edited.

1535
01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:39.750
But there's a scene with brand new in it were uh,

1536
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:43.080
sort of while they're torturing Martin Sheen and they've got him in like the hot

1537
01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:47.200
box,
you know the,
the ever popular bridge on the River Kwai you know?
Yeah.

1538
01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.640
So he's in a room and they pull the thing up and now the air comes in and,

1539
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.050
and Brando surrounded by children and that's the scene.

1540
01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:57.970
Like you see it from Martin Sheen's point of view,

1541
01:25:57.971 --> 01:26:01.920
the little white square of freedom and Brown does sitting there and he's,

1542
01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:07.370
it takes a time magazine.
He goes,
I don't want you to look at this.

1543
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.760
And heads of a Time magazine.
It's the most off putting and the Little v,

1544
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.220
you know,

1545
01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.870
Cambodian children are playing and jumping and fucking with Martin Sheen and

1546
01:26:14.871 --> 01:26:15.830
he's having to deal with that.

1547
01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:20.831
And then Brando's like reading from it says here from Time magazine and third,

1548
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.400
well maybe you should have a look at this and you know,

1549
01:26:25.401 --> 01:26:29.960
he likes you and more and she needs to read it.
And it's a very strange scene.

1550
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.820
It's one of the extra scenes in the,

1551
01:26:31.821 --> 01:26:35.270
in the version that I thought was good because you got to see Brando to

1552
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:35.871
something different.

1553
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:40.370
He's is in the sunlight for one thing and he's surrounded by kids to make it

1554
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.240
even weirder.
He's not surrounded by warriors.
Yeah,

1555
01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:48.250
that's strange because he's talking about the American propaganda about the war

1556
01:26:48.251 --> 01:26:52.160
and how he's being portrayed a bet that he's a mad person.

1557
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:55.880
And his point is that the government's mad,
the wars mad.

1558
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:59.810
He's being a sane person in the middle of the mad war by being mad as his,

1559
01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:01.490
you know?
Right,
right.
Like,

1560
01:27:01.491 --> 01:27:04.310
he cut people's heads off and you know all the things he does in the movie that

1561
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:08.270
you see of the,
the movie was the first movie that was,

1562
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:13.300
that had like the significant impact portraying the psychotic nature of war.

1563
01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:18.170
He's an American officer and he's being blamed for being too crazy in the middle

1564
01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:20.000
of a war where they're just shooting everyone they meet.

1565
01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.330
Who's going to go get a Martin Sheen?
Who's doing confluent is underwear,

1566
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.890
punching mirrors.
Fucking hotel runs the guy they sent the damaged,

1567
01:27:26.891 --> 01:27:29.420
they shut shuttle.
The damaged guy's nuts.
He's a drunk.

1568
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.670
Well because he's all he does is kill people for a living.

1569
01:27:31.671 --> 01:27:35.390
And now this is the fifth one or whatever in a row.
Cause he says,

1570
01:27:35.391 --> 01:27:39.590
have killed four guys.
God Damn,
that's a good movement.
And then so he's,

1571
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:43.490
and then he says,
what are you an assassin?
He goes,
uh,
I'm a soldier.

1572
01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:47.870
He says that you're an errand boy.
Sent it,
sent it.
What does it send to?

1573
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:52.460
Collected Storyville for clerks or something like that?
You're an errand boy.

1574
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:55.850
They're all so crazy.
The last time I saw that movie was,

1575
01:27:56.180 --> 01:28:00.110
I remember it very clearly because I just got one of those projector things in

1576
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:03.930
my house.
We could see a big ass green,
it was like 80 inches or something.
Oh.

1577
01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:08.420
And the sound is fantastic.
Helicopters
flying over your head.

1578
01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.870
And that was like the first thing that I watched was apocalypse now,
the Redo.

1579
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.450
And I was like this,
do you ever see the movie jar?
Jar Head?

1580
01:28:14.451 --> 01:28:17.730
Is it the one with Jake Gillen thought didn't see that.
Lots of the Iraq movie.

1581
01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:20.680
Right.
And they go to Iraq and good.
Yeah.
And,
and it's,

1582
01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:25.640
and Jamie Foxx is the tough sergeant and,
and,
and uh,
uh,
um,
what's his name?

1583
01:28:25.641 --> 01:28:29.060
Peter Sarsgaard and a JQL and Thaller the sharp shooters,
you know,

1584
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:31.730
they get any in it and they really see some action and this and that.

1585
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:35.240
But they play apocalypse now for the soldiers in that movie because they're all

1586
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:38.630
young.
This is 1991.
It's the first Gulf War.
Right.

1587
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:41.060
And they're imitating the movie.

1588
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:44.600
They're topping the raise and that's on their head like this,

1589
01:28:44.601 --> 01:28:49.250
the clips that go in the woods during the Valkyries scene and yet I thought,

1590
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:52.490
well it,
that's their World War II.
That's fine.
Yeah.

1591
01:28:52.491 --> 01:28:54.470
That scene where they go in and wipe out the village,

1592
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.500
that's their bridge on the river Kwai Wow.

1593
01:28:58.270 --> 01:29:02.010
Maybe not soldiers seeking inspiration from movies

1594
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v 1>about war,</v>

1595
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.000
<v 3>which seems so counterintuitive to the reality of,</v>

1596
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.730
well I was watching what some call it the other day,
full metal jacket and,

1597
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.500
and that's a real novel called the short timers and it's almost literally

1598
01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:17.160
adapted to that movie.
It seems like the movies hyperbole that the guy with the,

1599
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:19.020
I've read the book,
it's about a hundred pages long.

1600
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:23.430
<v 1>Isn't that just the,
I mean that's like a cliche.</v>

1601
01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:26.200
<v 3>Will you look up the short timers to see who wrote that?</v>

1602
01:29:26.201 --> 01:29:28.900
I can never remember the guy's name and full metal jackets.

1603
01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:31.420
I don't know if you'd liked full knowledge check and it's two movies,
right?

1604
01:29:31.421 --> 01:29:32.650
It's the drill sergeant.

1605
01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:36.660
<v 1>I liked the movie in the,
and then I was going to say is it's Cliche,</v>

1606
01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.490
life imitating art is like the old cliche,

1607
01:29:39.491 --> 01:29:43.590
and this is soldiers imitating soldiers,
right?
I mean they're,

1608
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:48.100
they're learning how to do this war thing based on a movie that they enjoyed

1609
01:29:48.101 --> 01:29:51.280
about war.
It's weird,
you know,

1610
01:29:51.281 --> 01:29:53.590
obviously they're going through training and obviously they're really going

1611
01:29:53.591 --> 01:29:55.480
through water,
but they're also good stuff.

1612
01:29:55.481 --> 01:29:59.080
House for getting some inspiration from these films about war,

1613
01:29:59.081 --> 01:30:00.730
which is fucking strange.

1614
01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:05.710
<v 3>And then that,
that movie,
uh,
the full metal jacket,</v>

1615
01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:10.570
it's not exactly successful in every way.
Cubix really detached filmmaker.

1616
01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.900
But there was one point,
I thought it was good and it was the biggest,

1617
01:30:13.901 --> 01:30:18.260
baddest guy in the unit who's named animal mother.
And he's obviously crazy.
Uh,

1618
01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:22.090
and he's mean and all that.
One of the other guys,
one of the other soldiers,

1619
01:30:22.091 --> 01:30:24.490
so it's about are marines rather than marines.
He says,

1620
01:30:24.491 --> 01:30:26.950
one of the other marine says about him,
you may not believe it,

1621
01:30:26.951 --> 01:30:29.470
but when we get into battle,
he's one of the most warmest,

1622
01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:32.950
wonderful individuals you'll ever meet in your meaning,
right?
He's,

1623
01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:37.000
he kills more guys than any other guy in this unit.

1624
01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:41.650
And you want him alive and you want him next to you at all times if we have to

1625
01:30:41.651 --> 01:30:43.810
fight cause cause it's going to kill him folks.

1626
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:47.560
And then they keep saying all the marines in the movie keeps saying when we go

1627
01:30:47.561 --> 01:30:50.980
back home it's not going to be like this.

1628
01:30:50.981 --> 01:30:54.540
They're having like one of the guys says these people that we've killed today or

1629
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:56.710
some of the finest individuals will ever meet,

1630
01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:00.880
now we're going to go back to the world and there won't be anybody worth
killing.

1631
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.870
Right?
Like cause their world's upside down now they live in a war world.

1632
01:31:04.871 --> 01:31:07.150
So everyone that they meet,

1633
01:31:07.151 --> 01:31:11.860
they the finest individ they said the finest individuals,
people they kill.
Yeah.

1634
01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.240
Are there because the meaning of their lives is different in the battle right

1635
01:31:16.241 --> 01:31:18.420
there.
They've been trained to kill.
They keep saying in the,

1636
01:31:18.421 --> 01:31:22.940
in the marine camp are you a killer over and over and all that.
So I don't know.

1637
01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.793
That's just a,

1638
01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:28.930
you can use warm movies to be moralistic about war.
But at the same time,

1639
01:31:28.931 --> 01:31:33.090
there's always the seductiveness of how strange when you put people in a,

1640
01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:36.040
in a world of war,
they act like it's a war.

1641
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.120
And then that's against the rules of society that we pretend we have.

1642
01:31:40.121 --> 01:31:44.520
Like you said,
that we're not just all fucking orcas running around.

1643
01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:44.931
<v 1>Well,</v>

1644
01:31:44.931 --> 01:31:49.820
it's very dangerous when you allow people to not conform to those rules to get

1645
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:53.540
thousands of people that you've trained that it's okay to kill folks.
You know?

1646
01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:56.420
And that's,
by the way,
that's a trait that they're going to keep.

1647
01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.190
A lot of them are gonna have a really hard time adjusting.
It's hard.

1648
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.250
You've killed a bunch of people and now when they see their friends get killed

1649
01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:07.750
for no reason,
sure.
Then the,
you know,
the,
there's some believable,

1650
01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.370
yeah,
w w we live in,
you know,

1651
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:13.990
a really unusual time because of that,

1652
01:32:13.991 --> 01:32:18.490
because we'd never had more information as far as like how damaging wars are

1653
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:22.510
psychologically thou,
how unnecessary they are.
For the most part,

1654
01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:27.530
the true financial influence behind the decisions that get made and all that

1655
01:32:28.631 --> 01:32:33.631
stuff is so dark and bizarre that when people have to go over there and fight it

1656
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:38.080
and then come back over here,
it's like man,
the world is upside down for them,

1657
01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:41.890
you know,
left his right and right is left and nothing fucking make sense at all.

1658
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:44.890
I had a Louis Theroux on the podcast this week,

1659
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.370
you know the documentary guy from,

1660
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:50.380
he was talking about hanging out with that a Westboro Baptist church guy and one

1661
01:32:50.381 --> 01:32:53.350
of the things that he said that I found fascinating was he went and visited with

1662
01:32:53.351 --> 01:32:57.010
these people for three weeks and he said that after a while all their hateful

1663
01:32:57.011 --> 01:33:02.011
bile stop being so shocking and it became like almost normal because he was

1664
01:33:03.371 --> 01:33:03.790
around.

1665
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:08.380
It's so often that he got like a little Stockholm syndrome a little bit.

1666
01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:10.870
Not really like he kept his objectivity,

1667
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.840
but he was talking about how the feeling of being around these people,

1668
01:33:13.841 --> 01:33:17.710
it had changed what's normal and which is what happens in a war,

1669
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:20.380
but in a much greater sense.
You know,
you chew,

1670
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:22.960
you're changing like not just hurtful thoughts,

1671
01:33:22.961 --> 01:33:27.790
but actions that involve killing and it becomes normal.
Oh yes.

1672
01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:28.330
Jazz.

1673
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:31.810
And then we blame people and then we arrest people in the middle of wars for

1674
01:33:31.811 --> 01:33:32.740
committing atrocities,

1675
01:33:32.741 --> 01:33:36.810
which are certainly atrocities but are as much a part of war as anything else.

1676
01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:37.660
It's a part of war.
Will.

1677
01:33:37.661 --> 01:33:41.410
Dunkin was telling me that someone committed atrocities wise,
they're honest,

1678
01:33:41.411 --> 01:33:45.430
mosquito,
um,
thing for a malaria drug.

1679
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:46.690
There's a malaria drug.

1680
01:33:46.691 --> 01:33:50.080
Apparently that causes a certain percentage of people that just fucking complete

1681
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:54.970
flip,
flip,
flip out.
And some of them get Amnesia and his buddy,

1682
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:57.010
I'm going to get him on my podcast,
I don't know his name,

1683
01:33:57.011 --> 01:34:00.670
but Dunkin's buddy lost all of his memory for a good deal of time.

1684
01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.300
And he was in India and people were talking to him and he had no idea that they

1685
01:34:04.301 --> 01:34:06.470
were,
and they arrested him because they thought he was a junkie cars,

1686
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:10.450
but he was really on a malaria medication.
Did he get his memory doc?
He did,

1687
01:34:10.451 --> 01:34:14.590
but not all of it.
I think this stuff's called layer IOM.
And this is,
uh,
some,

1688
01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.270
some stuff that,
you know,
it's just one of those things.

1689
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:18.070
It's how people just have an adverse reaction.

1690
01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:22.030
I personally have seen people have an adverse reaction to malaria medicine and

1691
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:26.980
it's fucking weird man,
because it was day Foley who's the sweetest,
nicest,

1692
01:34:26.981 --> 01:34:30.820
kindest,
friendliest guy you could ever meet.
He's always nice.

1693
01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:36.150
And he was on malaria medication and he had a couple of drinks and I don't know

1694
01:34:36.341 --> 01:34:38.290
if it's the mixture of the two or whatever,

1695
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:42.050
but he's like yelling it reporters and he took a risk,

1696
01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:45.550
took a reporter's tape recorder out and put it in his drink.

1697
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.640
The guy asked him a question,
he goes,
here's your answer.
Blink.

1698
01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.600
And he put it in his drink.

1699
01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.200
He was yelling at a guy that was one of the producers and I had to like

1700
01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:57.290
physically stand in front of him cause I was worried that he was going like,

1701
01:34:57.291 --> 01:35:01.580
go attack someone.
Yeah.
Then the next day he was so apologetic,
he was like,

1702
01:35:01.581 --> 01:35:06.530
I'm so sorry.
He absolutely remember it.
Yeah,
he did that medication.

1703
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:10.630
Everyone told them is absolutely that.
It literally makes you Fuku did he,

1704
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.400
was he exposed to malaria and the critical there's no,
no,
no,

1705
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:17.990
but he was going to ask,
oh,
he's taking them.
Yeah,
that's terrible.

1706
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.650
But,
and this is,
by the way,
this is 1994 five or something like that.

1707
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:24.860
So I don't know what the medication was right that he was on,
but whatever,

1708
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:28.970
this malaria medication wasn't turned him completely wacky.
I saw it in his eyes.

1709
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.680
He was,
and he was so apologetic.
I mean it's so out of character for him.

1710
01:35:33.681 --> 01:35:37.880
He's not a violent,
it's lovely.
Any stretch of the imagination.
So it was just so,

1711
01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:41.330
so to me like proof of concept,
like,
oh look,

1712
01:35:41.331 --> 01:35:45.710
you can get a normal nice guy and he becomes this really angry,

1713
01:35:45.711 --> 01:35:48.830
almost prone to violence.
Like yeah,
things went totally wrong.

1714
01:35:48.831 --> 01:35:51.170
I could have seen him hitting someone with a glass or something like that.

1715
01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:53.240
And then the shit hits the fan,
didn't even know what he was doing.

1716
01:35:53.241 --> 01:35:57.860
He had no idea what he was doing all because he was on some crazy mind bending

1717
01:35:57.861 --> 01:35:58.611
medication.

1718
01:35:58.611 --> 01:36:02.750
So for me to see a real Jacqueline Hyde on a guy that I knew fairly well I'd

1719
01:36:02.751 --> 01:36:06.380
worked with for a long time and I'd seen him under stress and as he was earlier,

1720
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:11.030
it was always handle things.
You know,
he would never be doing that.
No,
no.

1721
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:13.900
He never snapped and throw someone's tape recorder and it's hearing crane.

1722
01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:17.110
Did they just come up with these drugs and they fucking give them to people and

1723
01:36:17.111 --> 01:36:19.230
I'm like,
I'm pretty sure it's going to work in my,

1724
01:36:19.231 --> 01:36:21.680
I might have some side effects that they do.
Let us know.
We'll be over here,
hear,

1725
01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.570
get to say real small percentage though,

1726
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.910
less than a couple of percent and we're willing to take that.

1727
01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.190
We're willing to take that hit well,

1728
01:36:28.191 --> 01:36:30.170
it's great if you're not one of those people,

1729
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:32.630
if you're not one of the people that goes crazy or if you're one of those people

1730
01:36:32.631 --> 01:36:35.810
that takes the medication and doesn't drink,
it might be a drinking thing.

1731
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:38.300
I know I'm Zoloft apparently when,

1732
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:42.440
when mixed with alcohol became a real issue for folks and cocaine,

1733
01:36:42.441 --> 01:36:44.600
Zoloft if he makes it with cocaine apparently.

1734
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:48.110
But who would take so long to anchor cocaine on the same night?

1735
01:36:48.111 --> 01:36:51.770
Apparently it's pretty common.
People uh,
who are,
you know,

1736
01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.570
a lot of times people that have drug issues become depressed and uh,

1737
01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:59.870
in trying to get off those drugs and not sticking with their plan to get off

1738
01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:04.580
those drugs and then you do a real anyway psychotic episode.
Yeah.

1739
01:37:04.581 --> 01:37:07.280
You go fuck it.
I just want some coke and just do it.

1740
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.940
I dated a girl once who had a coke problem.
It was fascinating.

1741
01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.710
It was a very strange thing to be around because she's very smart but she

1742
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:19.770
couldn't help it.
She just had to have,
she was working in,
you know,

1743
01:37:19.771 --> 01:37:23.150
like studios and she was always around like,
uh,

1744
01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.370
she was always around like executives,
like agents and things like,

1745
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.440
like she worked for agencies and stuff and she just saw all these people,

1746
01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:33.540
these parties doing coke.
Cause it was like in the 90s.
Yeah.

1747
01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:36.800
Everyone was doing coke and she started doing coke too and just start liking

1748
01:37:36.801 --> 01:37:41.120
coke.
You know?
I was like this real weird issue.
You know,
like yeah,

1749
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:42.490
it's always in the back of your head.

1750
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:46.350
You want to get some coke always strongly if that's what you're doing,
that's,

1751
01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:48.010
that's pretty much preoccupation.

1752
01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:52.250
So if you get off of that stuff and you have a crash with some folks can have

1753
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:55.740
some people when they're trying to cure themselves of a disease,

1754
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.190
especially disease of alcoholism or disease of a drug addiction,

1755
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:04.280
they'll often seek help with antidepressants because they feel terrible.
Yeah.

1756
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:08.550
And then fucking they don't,
they don't adhere to the rules.
Right.

1757
01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.080
They go a little wacky one night,

1758
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:15.110
have a couple of Jack Daniels and then go buy a ball and get crazy and do a rail

1759
01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:18.660
and then fucking drive full on,
you know,

1760
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:23.100
90 miles an hour on a fucking residential street and try to hit people you
crazy.

1761
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:23.993
You know,

1762
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.680
it's really difficult as it is mixing anything that you know,

1763
01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:30.180
twists your mind like,
look,

1764
01:38:30.181 --> 01:38:35.181
red bull and vodka is a terrible thing to do cause we're retarded.

1765
01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.160
It's really,
well,
it's a retarded move.

1766
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:39.810
You're confusing the shit out of your body.

1767
01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.840
Your body doesn't know if it's on crank or if it's on a downer or Advil unlock

1768
01:38:44.841 --> 01:38:48.470
things.
I always feel like your rail,
if you're going to Dell,

1769
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:53.640
that's a Joey Diaz so you could drink more basically until he's so,
he said that.

1770
01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:56.040
Do you have get the fuck out of here with this red ball?
He goes,

1771
01:38:56.041 --> 01:39:00.480
I do a rail at nine o'clock in the morning like a fucking doctor got up in the

1772
01:39:00.481 --> 01:39:05.150
morning.
If you're going to do coke to coke,
you fucking pussy.
I agree.

1773
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.210
Oh,
I needed an energy drink.
Don't you fucking coke have some dignity.

1774
01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.580
I was going to take it.
It's true though.

1775
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.320
I was of training a fake soda pop coke drink is to me at night when you're

1776
01:39:16.321 --> 01:39:17.154
drinking.
He's like,

1777
01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.040
well I knew a dude a couldn't get off those monster energy drinks.

1778
01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.190
Homeboy used to have a giant can with him everywhere he went.
I never,

1779
01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:25.530
it was like his cocky,
you know like a cocky,

1780
01:39:25.531 --> 01:39:27.630
like a little blankie and carry around with you.

1781
01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:31.890
<v 4>Was He an Aa Guy?
Um,
I noticed a lot of drinking a,</v>

1782
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.950
they go crazy on caffeine because then the caffeine caffeine becomes the

1783
01:39:35.951 --> 01:39:38.470
substitute for a drink.
Cause at least you're Janky.

1784
01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:41.170
You get a feeling off caffeine and that substitutes,

1785
01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:43.600
it helps a little bit with the drug wanting.

1786
01:39:43.730 --> 01:39:45.120
<v 1>Yeah.
And cigarettes as well.</v>

1787
01:39:45.121 --> 01:39:48.720
They'll give in to the cigarettes bright because you have to have a crutch,

1788
01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:50.700
some kind of crutch.
You can't just,
you know,

1789
01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:52.950
did you hear that they're going to ban electronic cigarettes?

1790
01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:56.570
<v 4>Oh yeah.
It got approved already.
La You cannot,
you cannot,</v>

1791
01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.680
you can't do electronic cigarettes in bars.

1792
01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:03.670
You can't do them like in public places pretty much.
And why not?

1793
01:40:03.671 --> 01:40:05.980
Because people are idiots and they think that this is like,

1794
01:40:05.981 --> 01:40:10.940
they don't know what the second hand smoke smoke.
It's vapor and they don't.

1795
01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:14.440
Yeah,
it's just idiots.
New York did it and now la just followed suit.

1796
01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.390
Everybody liked you cigarettes cause you could smoke

1797
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:21.450
<v 1>should man.
They should.
It doesn't do anything.
It doesn't hurt anybody,
you know,</v>

1798
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:22.620
he doesn't do anything.

1799
01:40:22.621 --> 01:40:25.260
So Miss [inaudible] that he's worried about something that's going to hurt

1800
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:27.360
somebody.
People are so god damn crazy.

1801
01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:32.220
You should be worried about people's farts before you worried about letting go

1802
01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.070
into the right lane without speeding up to try to kill me.

1803
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:38.130
Maybe you should do that for me.
That's just where you live,
man.
I'll tell you,

1804
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:42.300
when I lived in Boulder,
Colorado,
I saw more merging than I ever saw my life.

1805
01:40:42.690 --> 01:40:46.760
People were so kind about it because it's only 100,000 people and people like,

1806
01:40:46.761 --> 01:40:50.130
Hey,
go ahead and get ahead.
You don't even in places like Seattle,

1807
01:40:50.131 --> 01:40:53.450
I find much more likely to let you in.

1808
01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.760
They're driving in slow motion when I get us more polite.

1809
01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:01.910
This is a crazy town of everybody trying to get there.
It's so gross though.

1810
01:41:01.911 --> 01:41:05.110
And it's the one thing that really moved Greg Proops while we talking.
Shit.

1811
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.490
Let's get Outta here,
man.

1812
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.010
I'm talking about forming a colony like you and you said [inaudible] of our

1813
01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:16.140
friends together.
Let's fucking go somewhere.
I really do.
I need to be,

1814
01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:19.030
I love the weather at that.
I mean like other than that I,

1815
01:41:19.710 --> 01:41:22.870
we got a bunch of comics to move to a city.

1816
01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:25.840
If we picked a city like Seattle and a bunch of comics moved there.

1817
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.050
Do you know how,
what an epic move that would be for comedy?

1818
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:33.100
If we just decided we're all gonna get together and we'll open up a comedy club

1819
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:34.980
collective Seattle.
Fuck that.

1820
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:38.640
Why not Seattle's anyway to rainy?
Do you know?

1821
01:41:38.690 --> 01:41:43.510
Columbus is one day less rain.
But you know what dude,
you got on the road,
man,

1822
01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:44.950
you do comedy on the road.

1823
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:49.390
You just book shit during the winter and like Phoenix and you'll be fine.

1824
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:51.330
Just do a gig every now and then on the road.

1825
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:54.160
You know what you're going appreciate.
You're gonna appreciate cooler,

1826
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:58.090
relax people that are under less pressure.
A lot of intelligent people,

1827
01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.890
beautiful scenery.

1828
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:04.540
I mean gorgeous trees and lush green forests because they get so much moisture.

1829
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:08.460
The number one problem we have in California is that we don't get enough.
No,

1830
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:12.250
I'd rather do it.
Denver.
Portland is a good move to Portland.

1831
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:17.260
Denver's Denver's the best.
They have great food and good wine and good weed.

1832
01:42:17.261 --> 01:42:19.890
They have all the civilized things that I think make places nice.

1833
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.733
And like you say,

1834
01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.090
it's the show business because I was noticing like a,

1835
01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:29.320
you know Harold Ramis,
he passed,
he moved back to Chicago at too.

1836
01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:30.850
His parents never had,

1837
01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.170
and I remember reading a quote from him when he passed the,

1838
01:42:34.171 --> 01:42:36.820
one of the articles about him said,
he goes,
uh,

1839
01:42:37.710 --> 01:42:40.960
I'm number one here man.
He goes,
other than the key Sachs,

1840
01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:45.100
I'm the biggest thing in this neighborhood.
And that made me laugh my ass off.

1841
01:42:45.101 --> 01:42:48.670
And I thought,
but you're right.
Right.
Like he didn't do it for that reason.

1842
01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:53.770
But when you go back to the hood,
he's here.
He's still Harold Ramis,

1843
01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:58.970
the director and writer.
He just didn't want to be in harder.

1844
01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.210
Yeah.
You don't have to be,
you know,
you don't,

1845
01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:05.590
it's not necessary when you get to a certain level,
I think at any level anymore.

1846
01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:09.240
I mean,
not as much love much on the road.

1847
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:12.310
A mile mean like we're on the road.
I am,

1848
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:15.790
but I really do love that my friends are here.
That's the big one.

1849
01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.850
The big one is all the comics that we know that here we do that we have this

1850
01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:21.130
giant community.
It's amazing.

1851
01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.920
Like we do these ice house shows on Wednesday nights,

1852
01:43:23.921 --> 01:43:27.160
like 10:00 PM shows him then we're probably gonna do next Tuesday or if we can

1853
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.600
and they,
they're fucking the most fun you could ever have.

1854
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.890
We're hanging out with Brian.

1855
01:43:32.891 --> 01:43:36.070
Callan is doing them when bill's bill burrs done them,

1856
01:43:36.071 --> 01:43:39.550
Joey Diaz and all these different people are doing them and everyone's having a

1857
01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:40.930
great time.
Brian's done.

1858
01:43:40.931 --> 01:43:45.010
I'm a bunch of times and Duncan's done on a bunch of times and when we,
you know,

1859
01:43:45.011 --> 01:43:48.160
it's not just a hang out,
everybody's in town were all hanging out together.

1860
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:49.240
We'll get like five,

1861
01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:53.960
six friends together and we're laughing and having fun and going up in front of

1862
01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:57.500
great crowds.
That's hard to move away from.
Yes,
that's hard.

1863
01:43:57.650 --> 01:44:01.490
All the comics are hard.
Everything else can go fuck itself.

1864
01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:03.410
Get all the comics,

1865
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:07.730
just everybody get out of your mortgage and figure out a way to get to Denver.

1866
01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:09.413
All of us.

1867
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:12.650
I do love some of the venues and I do love the crowds and I like you said,

1868
01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:14.840
did I,
you know,

1869
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:18.500
you're able to eke out a little existence for yourself here and an identity and

1870
01:44:18.501 --> 01:44:21.710
have the thing go on.
And then a big shark pool like this,

1871
01:44:21.711 --> 01:44:26.000
that's a really important to have that.
But say if you did a weekly show,

1872
01:44:26.001 --> 01:44:30.820
it's like you say the other shit really not worth all up my wiener.
Not Worth it.

1873
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:34.770
Dealing with those people,
it's not worth it.
There's too many in the [inaudible].

1874
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.970
What does everybody want?
What is it you want wealth and shit.

1875
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.970
They want to fill a hole.
They want us to get validation.

1876
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.500
They want to be an it person.

1877
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.640
I dated a girl once who was an actress at the last one and it was pulling away

1878
01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:49.640
and uh,
she actually said it to me.
She,
you know,

1879
01:44:49.641 --> 01:44:53.270
I was talking about the devils rag.
Hollywood report him.
I don't read that Shit.

1880
01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:54.710
That shit's bad for you.
I go,

1881
01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:57.320
you're just going to be looking at all these people.
Why didn't I get that?

1882
01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.730
How come I didn't move up?
So I go,

1883
01:44:58.731 --> 01:45:01.910
they just got tagged your it like you can't connect yourself to that.

1884
01:45:01.911 --> 01:45:04.880
Somebody got tagged,
they got lucky.
I got lucky.
I got on TV.

1885
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:07.540
There's no reason for me to be on TV when I was on TV,
right?

1886
01:45:07.670 --> 01:45:09.830
Anybody else could have done an adequate or better job.

1887
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:14.090
I just got lucky and these people were freaking her out and she goes,

1888
01:45:14.091 --> 01:45:17.520
when am I going to be it?
When am I going to be at?
What am I going to get tagged?

1889
01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.080
What?
Sometimes it doesn't happen,
right?
And that's not you.

1890
01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:26.060
That fucking dead,
dead drives people crazy.
That drives people fucking crazy.

1891
01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:29.000
It's one of the reasons why everyone's so nuts here is because the,

1892
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:32.660
the idea that you have no control over your own destiny and you need a bunch of

1893
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:35.300
people to decide whether or not they're going to cast you in like you.

1894
01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.600
And the only reason you would put yourself in that position,

1895
01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:42.620
the first place you have this massive debt,
your,
your,
your childhood,

1896
01:45:42.621 --> 01:45:47.090
something went wrong.
You just,
and extraordinary amounts of attention.

1897
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:49.100
So just combine those two things.

1898
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.970
The need for extraordinary amounts of attention and your life being based on

1899
01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:56.060
other people's acceptance.
That's why you get a bunch of phony fucks.

1900
01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.780
A bunch of people just parroting the shift that they read on salon.com and what

1901
01:45:59.781 --> 01:46:04.781
are the left wing rhetoric that they've heard this dispute by or dispensed by

1902
01:46:05.991 --> 01:46:08.850
intelligent people and they just repeat those things without even thinking about

1903
01:46:08.851 --> 01:46:12.290
it.
Yeah,
there's a lot of that here.
There's a lot of nonsense here.

1904
01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:15.440
A lot of pretend people that aren't even,
they don't even know who they are.

1905
01:46:15.441 --> 01:46:16.610
They even have opinions.

1906
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:20.300
They've adopted a conglomeration of other people's opinions because they think

1907
01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:24.830
that'll let them get a fucking sitcom that'll get them in at the next CSI,

1908
01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.020
you know,
interview fuck.

1909
01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:30.460
<v 4>But it's also really cool because it's so surreal here.
Like,
like you know,</v>

1910
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:33.550
I was at Starbucks the other day and Wil Wheaton was in front of me and it's

1911
01:46:33.551 --> 01:46:35.710
like the motherfucking stand by me guys right there.

1912
01:46:35.711 --> 01:46:40.030
I grew up with this kid and then t and then the Toronto Mayor Crack Mayor was at

1913
01:46:40.031 --> 01:46:42.040
the comedy store getting drunk with everyone.
The other,

1914
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.790
<v 1>of course.
Why didn't you call me</v>

1915
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:46.090
<v 4>La Jolla?</v>

1916
01:46:46.090 --> 01:46:46.811
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

1917
01:46:46.811 --> 01:46:50.200
I would go to the comedy store to hang out with rob for whatever nanny Ikea's

1918
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.210
course.
You went to the store.
The store is a fucking vortex for crazy people.

1919
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:58.960
It's sucks them in like a magnet,
a little iron sheet that says,
fuck.
Yeah,

1920
01:46:58.961 --> 01:47:02.250
it does.
When Brian and I were there all the time,
we used to film there.

1921
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:05.010
We met the most bizarre people,

1922
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.890
people that thought that there was the second coming of Christ.

1923
01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.100
We met prostitutes that told us exactly how they went about their business.

1924
01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.510
Everybody film,
they didn't care.
They're just crazy people in that spot.

1925
01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:21.360
He was partying.
Every comic got a photo with him.
Austin,
so that's so awesome.

1926
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:25.200
Is He gone now?
Yeah.
He left out yesterday after being on Jimmy Kimmel,

1927
01:47:25.201 --> 01:47:26.910
which I don't know if you heard what happened.

1928
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.520
I do know that after the show ended,

1929
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:34.200
he was pissed off at what happened on Jimmy Kimmel and what could he possibly be

1930
01:47:34.201 --> 01:47:36.450
pissed off about?
Jimmy smoke crack.

1931
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:39.620
He gets drunk all the time and he talked about that.
He didn't eat,

1932
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:42.450
say wanting to eat a girl's pussy during a press conference.

1933
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:46.320
He's a fucking mayor.
You're not a comedian dude.
He can't say shit like that.

1934
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:50.480
Did you see his appearance on the show?
No,
I didn't see it.
No.
No.

1935
01:47:50.481 --> 01:47:53.970
I don't check it out though.
It's,
it's like he's just,

1936
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.220
he's just a sad case.
It's the,
the people got screwed.
Okay.
The people,

1937
01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.020
Toronto don't think this is a God damn joke cause their entire city,

1938
01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:05.750
one of the great cities in the fucking three municipality in North America,

1939
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:10.260
he's their man.
It's a God damn awesome city.
Toronto is the shit.

1940
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:14.630
Could you imagine if your city was being represented by some obese crackhead?

1941
01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.390
Yeah.
Which is what he is and he's seedless,
he's an obese,
dense,

1942
01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:20.400
crack head who sucks at communicating.

1943
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:24.780
And the worst one is there's a video of him coked up talking about how he's

1944
01:48:24.781 --> 01:48:26.010
going to beat some guy up there.

1945
01:48:26.011 --> 01:48:28.920
He's going to be like Mike Tyson and they're talking about like,

1946
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.190
do you want to fight them MMA?
Like how many minutes you need,
like five minutes.

1947
01:48:32.191 --> 01:48:35.430
Or I could do five minutes.
Like,
he's like,
he's so coked up.

1948
01:48:35.431 --> 01:48:39.090
He's like pacing back and forth talking about,
you know,
like you don't know me.

1949
01:48:39.091 --> 01:48:40.890
He doesn't know me.
I'm crazy.
I'll beat the shit out of him.

1950
01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:45.510
I'll fucking charge one.
But he's all,
this is a fucking mayor or you're a mayor.

1951
01:48:45.570 --> 01:48:49.440
Millions of people.
Uh,
your responsibility talking like a drunk teamster.

1952
01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.920
You know what I mean?
He's crazy.
Well,
they weren't,
I mean,

1953
01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:54.210
I've been up there a bunch of the sheer,
and they're,

1954
01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.840
they're not thrilled about it.
I shouldn't be using,

1955
01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.900
obviously they find it easy.
They have to,
but it's fair.

1956
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.760
They have this amazing fucking city.
It's amazing.
And the most amazing cities,

1957
01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.390
there's a Turd floating around in it.
It's fun.
They can't get him out,
man.

1958
01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:13.260
They try it and you they're do nice up there.
They're do.
Nice.

1959
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:17.350
Could you imagine if that guy was a mayor of a city in Russia?
Less.

1960
01:49:18.130 --> 01:49:21.980
Yeah,
Canada is the anti Russia don't really nice,

1961
01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:27.570
but he's kicking ass though.
As a mayor.
Is he doing well?
Really?

1962
01:49:27.571 --> 01:49:31.760
Well that's what the problem does.
See,
I would like to read that because,
uh,

1963
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:35.880
the things that I hear from Toronto people online are not positive at all.

1964
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:39.810
I'm hearing that he's a terrible mayor,
but I dunno man.

1965
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:43.270
Maybe a guy needs a little break.
It needs a little break poo.
Oh,

1966
01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.920
come to La and do Jimmy Kimmel and then get mad at Jimmy Kimmel.
Well,
I'm saying,

1967
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:48.251
you know,

1968
01:49:48.251 --> 01:49:52.700
maybe smoking a little crack is something that could do all mayors a little.

1969
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:55.750
Do you do it?
I think,
well,

1970
01:49:55.751 --> 01:49:59.250
there's only been two that have ever been caught Marion Marian,
him.
So,
um,

1971
01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.660
I tend to agree with you because that's enough of a sample group that doesn't

1972
01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:05.350
want to say all.
You're going to use that to represent the right.

1973
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:07.570
If each mayor represents all the mayors.

1974
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.220
I would say that that's all the mayors I met Marion Barry and I asked him about

1975
01:50:12.221 --> 01:50:16.440
the crack sound,
the opie and Anthony Show.
And uh,
I pulled him in,

1976
01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:19.030
he was walking down the hallway and I was on the opiate Anthony Show where we

1977
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.450
were like,
Holy Shit,
that's Mary and Barry.
So we went out and I go,
let's get him,

1978
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:23.000
let's get him.

1979
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.590
And then the publicist like didn't know what to do because we asked him to be on

1980
01:50:26.591 --> 01:50:29.020
like,
it wasn't scheduled beyond right.
And then all of a sudden,
boom,

1981
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.370
he sitting down and me and Anthony and Oop,
we're,

1982
01:50:31.371 --> 01:50:34.450
we're drilling him and asking him questions and I was like,

1983
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.060
did you really smoke crack?
And then hotel was,

1984
01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.720
nobody knows who it was cracking that pipe.
He goes,
I saw

1985
01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:44.560
he was hilarious.
He goes,
nobody knows that those cracking me up.
I'm like,
Damn,

1986
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:46.750
you got me?
But you didn't say you didn't smoke crack,

1987
01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.020
which is what I would say if you said,
hey,
Joe Rogan,

1988
01:50:49.021 --> 01:50:50.620
do you smoke crack at a hotel?
I'm like,
no,

1989
01:50:50.621 --> 01:50:53.950
I didn't smoke crack in a fucking hotel.
But he's like,

1990
01:50:53.951 --> 01:50:56.800
nobody knows who it was cracking that plan.
And I was like,
whoa,

1991
01:50:56.830 --> 01:51:00.730
that's some genius double legal talk.
Wow.

1992
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:06.190
I was just [inaudible] he said yes.
Oh yeah.
He said,
well,
it's a disgrace.

1993
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:09.880
I'm very sorry.
I feel embarrassed,
but we're going to have to move on.
Yeah.

1994
01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.090
I need to run the city for Toronto is brilliant people living in it.

1995
01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:18.430
Three years ago I was there and uh,

1996
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:21.860
<v 3>or,
oh it's in Montreal and,
and he,
that was when he flipped off the little girl,</v>

1997
01:51:21.861 --> 01:51:25.610
I don't know if you remember that.
Oh,
he flipped off a little girl.
He's just,

1998
01:51:25.611 --> 01:51:28.310
you know,
he's just stopped that bull in a China shop.

1999
01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:32.660
He pulled out that alive in a lady and,
and you know,

2000
01:51:32.690 --> 01:51:35.180
he's trying to get around her and he went like this and shipping out a kid in

2001
01:51:35.181 --> 01:51:38.330
the car with her.
And then it was her,
cause it's Canadian TV,
you know,

2002
01:51:38.331 --> 01:51:40.430
they interviewed her on CBC and like she,
she's like,

2003
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:43.490
when I was driving and he get you this stuff and like I still had that.

2004
01:51:43.491 --> 01:51:44.810
It was moved forward and then he,

2005
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:48.230
he know he made this signal to me and my daughter was there in the front seat

2006
01:51:48.231 --> 01:51:51.200
and she saw it as well and he drove off and you know,
you're like,
you know,

2007
01:51:51.201 --> 01:51:55.700
she ain't lion.
She's just a little by late Canadian person.
And he took,

2008
01:51:55.701 --> 01:51:58.010
they are the nicest people in the world.
A couple

2009
01:51:58.010 --> 01:52:00.200
<v 1>of blasts and the bathroom was like,
no,
he didn't.</v>

2010
01:52:00.201 --> 01:52:05.201
He was huffy and he liked it going lady move that he had a slice of Pepperoni.

2011
01:52:06.230 --> 01:52:09.320
I got shit to do.
I got to hook her.
I got to go beat up or whatever.

2012
01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.770
I'm feeling a little sleepy.
I'm just going to do a quick line.

2013
01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:16.600
I gotta I gotta get back to the office and make new traffic agendas.
Yeah.

2014
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:18.980
I got a couple,
I've got a couple of calls I got to take.

2015
01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:23.330
What a weird time for the guy,
like a guy like that to be a mayor.

2016
01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.390
They were having a tickle,
tickle wars.

2017
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:29.330
That's how they don't tell each other secrets.

2018
01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.970
They tickle each other until they wind up coming each other's mouths.

2019
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:35.090
That's what starts,
it starts with tickling.
That's how they do it.

2020
01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.870
That's how they get,
that's how they recruit you.
That's what Canadian military,

2021
01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.750
that's tickling the,
that's how they make people talk.

2022
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:47.120
They typically don't give you a pink ballet.
Very painful.
Yeah,
and these guys,

2023
01:52:47.121 --> 01:52:48.800
they just,
it's a diversion of that and they,

2024
01:52:48.850 --> 01:52:50.690
they typically each other till the lower each other.

2025
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:55.310
He just probably eating a lot of food.
He's eating a lot of food,

2026
01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:58.330
unbelievable amounts of food.
Tried to put him on a diet to it and then,

2027
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.890
well he probably can't even think straight.

2028
01:53:00.891 --> 01:53:04.370
It's probably digesting food all the time.
And that's why he needs to do coke.

2029
01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.530
Yeah.
Just to fucking little pick me up.
You know,

2030
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:08.990
he's probably always on the wall because your body's like that.

2031
01:53:08.991 --> 01:53:12.080
You're not gluten free.
I'll tell you that.
Great acclaim free.

2032
01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:14.810
He's not gluten free.
He's not barbecue free.

2033
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:18.170
He's probably just dealing with all these clogs shit and his body,

2034
01:53:18.171 --> 01:53:20.000
of course he has.
And so he can't think straight.

2035
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:23.180
And he really has an obligation to take care of those people in Toronto and he

2036
01:53:23.181 --> 01:53:25.640
loves them and cares for them dearly.
So because of that,

2037
01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:28.590
he does a little bump here and there to give himself a little pick me up so we

2038
01:53:28.591 --> 01:53:31.640
can get the job done better.
A lot of people that don't understand that though,

2039
01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:34.820
they misconstrue and they think he's a drunken buffoon,

2040
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:37.730
that it's just a big fat embarrassment.
He's not.

2041
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:42.110
What he's doing is he's sacrificing his own public image for the job.
I see.

2042
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:46.190
He's doing,
he's doing what he's got to do.
I'd like to believe is responsible.

2043
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:48.440
If I did coke,
you would think I was trying to get a line off him.

2044
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:52.310
I was going to say the way you're talking right now,
you can be honest PR stuff.

2045
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:54.170
I could convince myself in almost anything.

2046
01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.570
I convinced myself into big foot for several years.

2047
01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:01.300
I could convince myself that might exist.
Mary,
2012 which one?
Oh,

2048
01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:06.360
December 21st I was committed by having a license plate was December,

2049
01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:09.050
2012.
Oh uh,
the end of the Mayan calendar.

2050
01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.230
The calendar is the end of the long count of the Mayan calendar.

2051
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:16.790
I always subscribed to the long count calendar theory and that the snake God is

2052
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:19.910
coming.
You know what I,
I was listening to this Mckenna lecture the other day,

2053
01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:22.970
never said it.
That was my favorite part of that whole theory.
No,
they never did.

2054
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:26.450
They never stood up and went by the way it's over.

2055
01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:29.600
It was just the end of a cycle.
Just like January goes into February.
I mean,

2056
01:54:29.601 --> 01:54:30.460
it was,
it wasn't one,

2057
01:54:30.490 --> 01:54:33.650
they built their calendar so perfectly that it was a perpetual cycle.

2058
01:54:33.651 --> 01:54:37.760
So I was re listening to this Mckenna lecture and it was really fascinating

2059
01:54:37.761 --> 01:54:40.630
because he was,
uh,
talking about the,

2060
01:54:40.631 --> 01:54:43.190
the Mayan language being something called the reverse language,

2061
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.390
which means that the,
the symbols and his loss language,

2062
01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.850
they represent sounds.

2063
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:54.890
They don't represent things or they repor like say like,
like,
like,
uh,

2064
01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.320
no,
they represent things not sounds.
That's what it is.

2065
01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.440
So like there was a symbol for an eye and there's a symbol for a saw cutting

2066
01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:08.081
wood and this is a symbol for a rose and it was all right and an aunt like a bug

2067
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.940
in it.
That would be how you would say I saw aunt rose,

2068
01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:12.680
like that's their language.

2069
01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:16.190
So the language is incredibly complicated to try to interpret of course,

2070
01:55:16.191 --> 01:55:19.010
because we don't know what the fuck anything meant.
Right.
Unlike glyphs,

2071
01:55:19.011 --> 01:55:22.170
which represents sound,
right,
like or his or her,
you know,

2072
01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.710
t play these things with my kids in the car.

2073
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:29.000
T is the ta sound letters,

2074
01:55:29.001 --> 01:55:33.720
sound hold down.
It's cute,
it's very cute.
But they didn't have that.
They didn't,

2075
01:55:33.721 --> 01:55:35.900
didn't represent sounds that represented things.

2076
01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:39.530
So it was really fucking confusing to try to like interpret.

2077
01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:43.070
So a lot of people's versions of what the Mayan calendar set or man,

2078
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.410
they're all fucking screwy.
They're like,
they're still working on that stuff.

2079
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:48.870
Like every now and then they have these big breakthroughs,

2080
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:50.310
these Rosetta stone moments.

2081
01:55:50.311 --> 01:55:54.240
But it's a very difficult time finding more and more minds stuff all the time.

2082
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.050
And there's also zillions of minds here in southern California.
Yes,
absolutely.

2083
01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:00.810
Yeah.
People go where the mines were good.
They were,
they became Mexicans.

2084
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:03.810
And if you go down where they go,
you can,
you can see them all over the streets.

2085
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.750
Well,
if you go to the Yucatan,
especially,

2086
01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:08.070
you could go like near the mine temples that she needs.

2087
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.990
So you see people with a very different look,

2088
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:15.500
very Mayan native American look very different and pronouncedly different and

2089
01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:18.150
they're fucking tiny man.
I was going to say they're four foot nine.

2090
01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:22.980
There's so small.
There was a woman,
um,
that I,
I mean I'm short,

2091
01:56:22.981 --> 01:56:26.920
I'm five,
eight and this woman was literally be like breast height to me.

2092
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:30.090
She was like one of those little hobbit people almost,
you know,

2093
01:56:30.091 --> 01:56:34.230
one of those homo floresiensis be that I was really like strange.

2094
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.850
And they all sell artifacts to Gringos Mayan artifacts.
You know,

2095
01:56:38.851 --> 01:56:43.050
whether by these ancient structures that someone in their ancestry built,

2096
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:48.100
no one knows how fascinating fucking shit.
Oh,
representing the cosmos in,

2097
01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:48.330
you know,

2098
01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:53.330
in alignment with different constellations and exacting as if there a choice in

2099
01:56:53.611 --> 01:56:57.120
it astronomically.
Perfect.
Calendar and more perfect than any European calendar.

2100
01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.000
Oh yeah.
And it's also,
it's the,

2101
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:03.420
when they look at these structures and they look at the complexity in them and

2102
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:07.020
they try to figure out where the stones all came from and what kind of fucking

2103
01:57:07.021 --> 01:57:09.180
knowledge these people must have had to be able to,

2104
01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.970
there's no shitty construction.
No.
Like,
you know,

2105
01:57:11.971 --> 01:57:15.060
you ever have a carpenter come to your house and he'd do a shit job of making

2106
01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:18.920
this fucking thing line up.
But that thing,
and it's not level,
it's,

2107
01:57:18.930 --> 01:57:23.580
there's a gap over here.
You see amazing symmetry in stone,

2108
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:28.770
beautiful geometric patterns that if you,
you know,
you made all these stones,

2109
01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:30.930
if you were off like an inch or an inch there,

2110
01:57:30.931 --> 01:57:34.470
by the time you got to the top would be all fucked up and sideways.
But no,

2111
01:57:34.471 --> 01:57:37.500
these things are beautiful.
No.
Yeah.
And we don't know how they did it.

2112
01:57:37.501 --> 01:57:39.820
We don't get unbelievable engineers.
Yeah.
Incredible.

2113
01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:43.820
And we're talking about no mortar to yeah,
they're just stones.
Like they,

2114
01:57:44.210 --> 01:57:47.940
that's the interesting fitted him.
Yeah.
That's the interesting facet about them.

2115
01:57:47.941 --> 01:57:51.540
It's like clearly they were very advanced,
but also clearly very primitive.

2116
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:55.150
There's things that they,
that we have figured out that they hadn't,
well,

2117
01:57:55.190 --> 01:57:59.640
they didn't have candles evidently.
Well,
they weren't a fossil fuel economy.

2118
01:57:59.970 --> 01:58:04.440
They weren't a fossil fuel civilization.
What they were and what Egypt is,

2119
01:58:04.441 --> 01:58:08.970
is as far as a civilization gets without combustion,

2120
01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:11.400
without fossil fuels and engines,

2121
01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:14.190
they figure out this alternative path.

2122
01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:19.080
It's like human innovation is not subject to the rules that we've experienced in

2123
01:58:19.081 --> 01:58:21.120
our life.
This is just one way to go.

2124
01:58:21.450 --> 01:58:23.970
When you look at the way the Mayans went and he looked at the way the Egyptians

2125
01:58:23.971 --> 01:58:26.430
went,
what they did is like the dolphin thing,

2126
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:31.440
like they can change their environment the way we can,
you know,
today.

2127
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.740
So what they did was they figured out a way to do it with natural items.

2128
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:38.460
They figured out a way to express themselves in this advanced way without the

2129
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:40.200
tool.
So where's the dolphins don't have thumbs.

2130
01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.130
They didn't have machines or stainless steel.

2131
01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:45.880
So they fought somehow or another figured out a way to make clearly they had

2132
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:49.860
mathematically per,
yeah.
Without her.
Then they had astronomy and philosophy and,

2133
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:52.730
and they had history that we can't fathom.
We can,

2134
01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:57.070
we even can't even wrap our heads around the idea of a thousand years of
history.

2135
01:58:57.330 --> 01:59:02.330
If we get about 200030004000 the Egyptians were in that location for a long

2136
01:59:03.041 --> 01:59:07.180
fucking time and they were writing shit down that we'll never get to read

2137
01:59:07.181 --> 01:59:11.440
because of the light of the fires of the library of Alexandria.
So it's weird.

2138
01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:15.900
That is such an unbelievably fascinating culture.
Oh,
unbelievably.

2139
01:59:16.150 --> 01:59:18.430
Because it's what happens when you don't have the fossil fuels.

2140
01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:21.820
What would we do without oil?
We would maybe have pyramids.

2141
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.640
We've figured out how to make that.
We would have gone another way.

2142
01:59:24.641 --> 01:59:26.960
We'd have gone this way if we couldn't figure it out.

2143
01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:30.910
They didn't sail all over the world.
Well,
there's evidence that they did,
right?

2144
01:59:30.911 --> 01:59:32.380
Yeah.
It's disputed.
Apparently.

2145
01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:36.610
I talked about it before that someone from Egypt,

2146
01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:40.690
they found cocaine in Egypt that could have only been grown in South America,

2147
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:45.310
but then someone sent me hip to a link that it might have been a false positive

2148
01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:49.950
based on cocaine,
like plants that existed in the Egypt at that time.
That wasn't,

2149
01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:52.180
we underestimate the ancients.
That's all I'm saying.

2150
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:55.030
I think that they did have the ability to go around the world if people were

2151
01:59:55.031 --> 01:59:57.550
able to populate all the Polynesia and those mile islands,

2152
01:59:57.551 --> 02:00:00.100
you're thousands of miles apart.
But you know,
they figured that out too.

2153
02:00:00.101 --> 02:00:04.140
There was a documentary or a,
um,
a docu drama about it,
uh,

2154
02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:07.270
from some strange name was a foreign film.
I just watched it the other day.

2155
02:00:07.271 --> 02:00:10.180
Me and Ari watched it where they,
in Peru,

2156
02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:14.560
they got on a boat and they sailed all the way across to the South Pacific.

2157
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:19.120
Kon Tiki did that for the 14.
That's it.
That's the movie.
That's the movie.
Yes.

2158
02:00:19.121 --> 02:00:21.020
Kon Tiki.
That's exactly what it is.
This is,

2159
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:24.220
and he said that they were related to south sea islanders and the people of

2160
02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:25.710
South America.
Interesting movie.

2161
02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:28.240
So there's a couple of cut the shit moments in it.

2162
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.620
They kill a shark and bring it up on the fucking bar charts all the time in the

2163
02:00:32.621 --> 02:00:36.820
book,
but they pick it up and bring it to this like giant shark.

2164
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:40.940
It's so big that it's so obviously like Photoshop be like,
come on man.

2165
02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.420
Do you know how much that fucking thing would way?
First of all,

2166
02:00:43.421 --> 02:00:46.930
you can't just pull out on your raft,
asshole.
It's going to tip over your raft.

2167
02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:50.050
Right?
You can't just stab it in the head and kill you.
It's going to flop around.

2168
02:00:50.051 --> 02:00:53.860
It's a fish fuck face.
All right.
It's a shark,
but it's a fish.

2169
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:57.640
You can't just pull a shark on the deck there.
Giant man.
They fucking huge.

2170
02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.260
And the book,
they're doing it all the time.

2171
02:00:59.290 --> 02:01:01.690
He said they played with them and stuff.
Well,
I bet they did,

2172
02:01:01.691 --> 02:01:05.180
but I bet they were small,
smaller problems.
There's no way it was that big.
Yeah.

2173
02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:07.270
The one that they used in the movie was so preposterous.

2174
02:01:07.271 --> 02:01:08.230
It was a fucking missile.

2175
02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:12.160
There's even evidence that black Africans came over to the south and that I can,

2176
02:01:12.161 --> 02:01:15.370
stuff like that.
They don't really chase that stuff down as hard as they can.

2177
02:01:15.371 --> 02:01:17.830
Also,
uh,
the water levels change so much.

2178
02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:21.790
A lot of things are underground that warrant 10,000 years ago or underwater.

2179
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.880
So the coastlines of changed,
I think that dramatically.

2180
02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:28.180
And people live near the water.
So that's,

2181
02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:32.110
I think that not only that they're saying now that they think that people were

2182
02:01:32.111 --> 02:01:36.070
trapped in a landmass on the Bering strait for thousands of years,

2183
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:39.560
that it wasn't a smooth transition between people coming,
walking over,

2184
02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:43.940
like shown,
walking over.
People got stranded out there for thousands of years.

2185
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:47.030
Yeah.
I mean there was nowhere to go and everything.
The environment changed.

2186
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:51.800
The earth moved on them,
the earth moved on.
Yeah.
And they got stuck,
you know,

2187
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:54.890
and then there's the old mex who they don't even know who the fuck they were.

2188
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:55.160
Right.

2189
02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:59.300
And they have these African faces that are carved into these giant stones that

2190
02:01:59.301 --> 02:02:03.420
they're guesstimating.
It's somewhere around 6,000 years ago.
They really,

2191
02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:08.780
yeah.
They don't even know.
The mines were like,
what,
1500 years ago,

2192
02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.640
2000 years ago.
But the old Mex,
he didn't even know anything about them.

2193
02:02:13.641 --> 02:02:15.630
They don't anything about their language.
They don't know the,

2194
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:20.000
there are no so little.
So it's like the chase that down like what do you do?

2195
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:23.180
And then there's what they say about all those fucking theirs.

2196
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:26.000
They're finding on a regular basis in Mexico City,

2197
02:02:26.001 --> 02:02:29.500
they do construction and they find temples,
the dig into the ground.
I'm like,

2198
02:02:29.530 --> 02:02:33.530
Whoa,
hold up,
hold up.
We just hit gold.
Okay.
We found a gold castle,

2199
02:02:33.531 --> 02:02:36.530
like they find crazy shit on a regular basis.

2200
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:39.710
And then when they're going through the jungles,
especially at the Amazon,

2201
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:40.970
there was a whole thing.

2202
02:02:40.971 --> 02:02:45.290
I was watching a documentary on lost civilizations in the Amazon where they had

2203
02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:49.160
found these,
um,
these,
uh,
like paths,

2204
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:52.940
like creeks that had been carved into the ground,
aqueducts or what have you.

2205
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:58.090
They found this complex irrigation system that was built into these like unknown

2206
02:02:58.701 --> 02:03:01.220
jungle areas.
Right.
And they were like,
what the fuck is this?

2207
02:03:01.221 --> 02:03:02.380
And then there was a mound of,

2208
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:05.360
they figured out was actually a construction of some sort and they thought it

2209
02:03:05.361 --> 02:03:08.340
was just a hill,
but the hill had existed for so long,

2210
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:11.330
had been covered up with dirt and then became like,
you know,

2211
02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:14.020
let's just to fucking sell made that hell.
Yeah.
And they're looking at this like,

2212
02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.280
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This at one point in time somebody built this,

2213
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:19.010
like we're finding pottery and weird shit.

2214
02:03:19.011 --> 02:03:22.160
And then you look at it from a satellite,
you could actually see grids.

2215
02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:26.220
They started like finding grids with seismic readings and they'd use,
uh,

2216
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:27.343
you know,
um,

2217
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:30.410
there's all sorts of different ways they send radio waves into the ground.

2218
02:03:30.450 --> 02:03:30.991
<v 2>Right.
I know.</v>

2219
02:03:30.991 --> 02:03:33.660
Isn't that amazing how they can find the grids underneath things now?

2220
02:03:33.661 --> 02:03:34.740
Incredible structure.

2221
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.820
<v 1>But they'll like,
who was doing this?
Who,
who's shit is this?</v>

2222
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.640
Who are these people that live there now or don't live like,

2223
02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:42.480
<v 2>right.
No,
they're,
they,
they've,
it's primitive.</v>

2224
02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:45.440
This are much more primitive than those people were much more.
I mean,

2225
02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:49.740
<v 1>and it's ironic that you see these people and it's really primitive environment.</v>

2226
02:03:49.741 --> 02:03:50.640
You see them with like a Hanes,

2227
02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.720
<v 2>his tee shirt on.
Right,
of course.
Because we've poisoned the entire world.
Yeah.</v>

2228
02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:56.490
There's no more,
people don't make their own clothes.

2229
02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:59.800
We the third world where's all of our jetter Tennyson.
Yeah.

2230
02:04:00.190 --> 02:04:03.010
There's also the descent of man to,
I mean if you think about it that way,

2231
02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:07.450
the ancient Egyptians in the Mayans possess knowledge that we don't possess and

2232
02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:09.790
it does that mean we're more advanced than them because we have a phone and we

2233
02:04:09.791 --> 02:04:12.640
can check,
start douchebag friends.
I don't think it does.

2234
02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:15.640
I think they knew about the moon and the stars and the movement of the world and

2235
02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:17.840
maybe wouldn't have either been is panicked about.

2236
02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:21.010
So obviously natural disasters wiped them out in a lot of cases.

2237
02:04:21.011 --> 02:04:23.620
They're always talking about that with the Mayans was,
was it drought,

2238
02:04:23.621 --> 02:04:24.251
was it earthquake,

2239
02:04:24.251 --> 02:04:29.110
was it that forced them to move that forced them to change the thing that I

2240
02:04:29.111 --> 02:04:32.800
think they all sought to alter their environment.
There's none of this benign,

2241
02:04:32.801 --> 02:04:37.140
I live with nature under relief.
That's primitive.
People like you.

2242
02:04:37.141 --> 02:04:41.370
I say it in if you have any intellection all or any inhibition or any kind of
um,

2243
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:45.450
you know,
gumption or anything that motivates you to is curiosity.

2244
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:51.420
The Mayans farmed fish,
the mind's irrigated,
the mine's burned out.

2245
02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:54.750
Jungles.
The mines built giant things in the middle of other things.

2246
02:04:55.170 --> 02:04:57.900
They didn't live in harmony.
Like we like to think like,
oh,

2247
02:04:57.901 --> 02:05:02.760
they lived with a buffalo and they walked around.
They always seem to alter,

2248
02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.800
not only altered the universe they live in to interpret the physical universe as

2249
02:05:07.801 --> 02:05:11.340
it relates to them always.
And uh,
that's,

2250
02:05:11.490 --> 02:05:16.320
I think that's what people are and that kind of gets lost in the excitement of

2251
02:05:18.150 --> 02:05:23.150
having high technology and instantaneous communication and stuff is that if

2252
02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:26.160
they'd had it,
they would have employed it.
Like you said,

2253
02:05:26.161 --> 02:05:28.810
they went as far as they could without oil.
Uh,

2254
02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:33.420
if to give the mines electricity or the,
or the Egyptians,

2255
02:05:33.421 --> 02:05:34.650
let them have light at night,

2256
02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:38.610
let them have ultra powerful telescopes and space probe.

2257
02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:39.990
<v 1>Yeah,
no kidding.
I mean,</v>

2258
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:43.170
they probably had the same ingenuity and minds that we had.

2259
02:05:43.171 --> 02:05:45.930
They just had your watching the plan to work with.
They're watching the cosmos,

2260
02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:50.240
<v 2>they're trying to figure out the natural world and how cycles when and build</v>

2261
02:05:50.241 --> 02:05:51.170
here so that they didn't get it

2262
02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:55.280
<v 1>flooded and you know when you think about how much advancement they did have in</v>

2263
02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:59.270
those areas as areas of construction using natural materials and what an

2264
02:05:59.271 --> 02:06:01.340
indication that is of extreme intelligence,

2265
02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:05.400
<v 2>we assume with brass chisels and having to exploit the natural fissures and</v>

2266
02:06:05.401 --> 02:06:07.920
rocks and having to be engineers of the highest caliber or not,

2267
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:11.880
<v 1>and Brion pull up an image of the Mayan calendar,
pull up a stone image,</v>

2268
02:06:11.881 --> 02:06:16.590
find a good one because this the Mayan calendar,
it's like,
okay.

2269
02:06:16.890 --> 02:06:21.890
I mean I had an old joke about how few people understand technology of this is

2270
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:25.710
if I gave you a hatchet and left you in the woods,
how long would it take for?

2271
02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:28.860
You could send me an email that no one knows any of this shit.

2272
02:06:29.130 --> 02:06:33.060
How long would it take for you to ever figure out all the cycles of the earth

2273
02:06:33.061 --> 02:06:36.630
itself so that you could create this fucking countless eternity,

2274
02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.090
this fucking thing,
that piece of art,

2275
02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:43.930
which is more accurate than any western counties?
There's no leap years.
No,

2276
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:47.460
those are included.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Like you say,
the three counts,

2277
02:06:47.461 --> 02:06:52.060
they have the three cycles.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
It's,
it's,
and it,
it,
it,

2278
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:56.670
it's one of those things that like the Yugas,
like the Kali Yoga,

2279
02:06:56.671 --> 02:06:57.870
the ages of man,

2280
02:06:58.050 --> 02:07:02.460
it takes into account ages where people kind of took into account the rise and

2281
02:07:02.461 --> 02:07:07.350
fall of civilizations in their calendars as if it was off like sort of a

2282
02:07:07.351 --> 02:07:10.980
mathematical algorithm like the indies.
They,
the Hindus,

2283
02:07:10.981 --> 02:07:15.981
they thought that there was a mathematical program to like life on earth that

2284
02:07:16.951 --> 02:07:20.580
you would reach these ages of enlightenment and they would be followed by

2285
02:07:20.581 --> 02:07:23.970
darkness and it would be despair.
And then there'd be a rebirth.

2286
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.080
Like there's a yin and a Yang,
a breathing in and breathing out at tide goes in.

2287
02:07:28.081 --> 02:07:32.430
The tide goes out with everything including civilization.

2288
02:07:32.431 --> 02:07:33.720
Not always forward movement,

2289
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:38.780
but that that would be worked a calendar that would be [inaudible] agreed upon.

2290
02:07:38.921 --> 02:07:40.990
Not just as folklore.
No,
no,
no.

2291
02:07:41.850 --> 02:07:46.450
But think about the amount of religion of data that they would have to possess

2292
02:07:46.451 --> 02:07:48.040
for them all to agree on it.

2293
02:07:48.041 --> 02:07:52.060
Thousands and thousands of years of collected wisdom and watching planets in

2294
02:07:52.061 --> 02:07:54.390
retrograde watching cycles in motion.
Fuck.

2295
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:57.520
We can't even wrap our hands around that.
We can't.
We just can't.

2296
02:07:57.521 --> 02:08:00.280
Where do we think all the belief systems came from that we supposedly believe in

2297
02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:03.850
like two days and then Christianity and I don't want that on my balls.
That is,

2298
02:08:04.590 --> 02:08:06.030
Oh,
you can have that on your left,
right.

2299
02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:09.990
Ball Center taint is that guy Joe mode.

2300
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:16.030
Imagine the first time you ever dated a girl and she goes down.
Yeah,

2301
02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:19.810
and that's what she sees tattooed around your asshole.
She'd be like,
Oh,

2302
02:08:19.811 --> 02:08:22.400
cabaret back.
That's a deal breaker.
Yeah.

2303
02:08:22.450 --> 02:08:27.220
It is tattooed assholes or I can't go.
Well,

2304
02:08:27.221 --> 02:08:30.490
it's a bold aesthetic choice.
Yeah.
You can have a star on your forehead.

2305
02:08:30.491 --> 02:08:34.390
I'll let it slide.
Wow.
Pretty good idea.
Took right tattoo.
It's well,

2306
02:08:34.391 --> 02:08:36.550
you'd have to have someone who's a very talented artist.

2307
02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:40.020
I would be comfortable with,
say like an analytical one,
right to Mayan calendar,

2308
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:43.510
tattoos,
Erin Dellavedova or a Kat von d.
They would,
they would be able to

2309
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:46.630
<v 2>do that.
Well,
I'll say that the cultural significance of everything they did too.</v>

2310
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:48.730
They didn't just play sports to play sports.

2311
02:08:48.731 --> 02:08:50.470
Obviously they did just to amuse themselves,

2312
02:08:50.471 --> 02:08:54.310
but when they're having their big games,
those are an expression of,

2313
02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:57.160
as you were saying,
the Cozaar gruffy the university,

2314
02:08:57.161 --> 02:09:00.040
they were reenacting the moments of the universe.

2315
02:09:00.041 --> 02:09:04.240
That's why it was played for life and death
and all that.

2316
02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:06.430
I don't mean every day they didn't take for life and death,

2317
02:09:06.431 --> 02:09:07.720
but when they have their rituals,

2318
02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:12.880
you don't like the original Olympic Games were an Olympics because that was a

2319
02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:16.510
spiritual place and that's where all the temples were and it started as a small

2320
02:09:16.511 --> 02:09:20.560
event and then eventually became a unifying event for all of Greece or what they

2321
02:09:20.561 --> 02:09:22.420
call ionic know,
Hellenic culture,
whatever.

2322
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:27.750
But that's because it was a spiritual to play the Games was to be part of this

2323
02:09:29.201 --> 02:09:32.740
ongoing thing that went on and on.
It wasn't,
you know what I mean?

2324
02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:36.580
We win this sheer hurray for us.
You know,
obviously there's that moment of it,

2325
02:09:36.581 --> 02:09:39.610
but also you went there at a sacrifice.
She went there to sing,

2326
02:09:39.611 --> 02:09:41.800
you went there to pray,
you went there to be with everyone else.

2327
02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:45.640
People pitched up and camped.
It was a giant event and people came from,

2328
02:09:46.090 --> 02:09:48.760
it took a long time to get someplace then,

2329
02:09:49.090 --> 02:09:52.270
cause they didn't have a bus that took you there.
You had to get there.

2330
02:09:52.271 --> 02:09:54.880
And when you got there,
you didn't stay at a hotel.

2331
02:09:54.881 --> 02:09:56.590
You stayed in the field and you,
you know,

2332
02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:01.300
but yet they still had these giant organized games and you see the crowns from

2333
02:10:01.301 --> 02:10:04.150
them and you see the grounds.
They,
when they had the Olympics in Greece,

2334
02:10:04.151 --> 02:10:07.990
they played on lots of the original fields from Co,
you know,

2335
02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:11.680
of over a thousand years ago.
And imagine if there's a continuity of man,

2336
02:10:11.681 --> 02:10:13.630
you know that the imagining of what you can,
you know,

2337
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:17.300
<v 1>why did you have your discus thrower and you're in that arena.</v>

2338
02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:20.990
Those days there was discus throwers thousands of years ago standing in your

2339
02:10:20.991 --> 02:10:21.950
very footsteps.

2340
02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:25.800
<v 2>Yeah.
Or Javelin wouldn't put,
there's a bunch of events.</v>

2341
02:10:26.850 --> 02:10:31.380
They rode horses more and they rustled a lot.
And when they,
when they long jump,

2342
02:10:31.381 --> 02:10:36.290
they held weights,
they held weights when you could run and then,

2343
02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:39.150
or a standing long jump Wu and I just punched it and you,

2344
02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:42.000
but you held weight so you could go further.
You can go further with weights.

2345
02:10:42.030 --> 02:10:43.010
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you,

2346
02:10:43.011 --> 02:10:46.580
if you have like two 10 pound weights in your hands and you fling yourself

2347
02:10:46.581 --> 02:10:51.100
forwards it with the weights.
Drinks.
Yeah.
And so they fought,

2348
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:54.740
they didn't work gloves but they wrap their hand bugs bunny shit.

2349
02:10:54.741 --> 02:10:58.910
Like when you step out of a plane hits the ground,
right?
Yeah.

2350
02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:00.710
Now that it's all very,

2351
02:11:01.650 --> 02:11:06.590
and that's the thing that I think that why we like sports on TV and why people

2352
02:11:06.591 --> 02:11:10.430
like religion still.
If they do,
there's very little ritual left in our lives,

2353
02:11:10.590 --> 02:11:14.600
right,
and it's very little community ritual.
Like in a mind culture.

2354
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.970
When you woke up in the morning,
you didn't just go,

2355
02:11:16.971 --> 02:11:20.720
I wonder what I'm going to do today.
The drums went off before dawn,

2356
02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.160
the priests started singing the sun was song into existence.

2357
02:11:25.161 --> 02:11:29.810
Yet again on another day.
At the end,
Sisense was burned.
You went to school.

2358
02:11:29.811 --> 02:11:32.060
If you were a child or you went to your job,

2359
02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:37.300
your life was ritualized and your life was codified and your life was it.

2360
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:41.480
You were in a bar.
You know,
you had to do what you had to do every day.

2361
02:11:41.481 --> 02:11:42.314
And those cultures,

2362
02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.670
that's how they were able to have high culture with pyramids and and
engineering.

2363
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:49.760
They didn't just fucking wander around like we do and go,

2364
02:11:49.761 --> 02:11:54.110
I'm going to get high and fucking watch deputy dog and fucking,
you know,

2365
02:11:54.170 --> 02:11:58.010
Netflix,
my ass off all day.
Whenever I went.

2366
02:11:58.011 --> 02:12:01.610
Deputy dog eat dog.
I love it.
I went deputy dot.
You know what I mean?

2367
02:12:01.630 --> 02:12:06.200
It's like a,
that's the difference.
People built the pyramids,

2368
02:12:06.201 --> 02:12:10.490
the people that built the pyramids in Egypt were paid in beer and bread and

2369
02:12:10.491 --> 02:12:14.360
whatnot,
and lived in camps near the pyramids with their families.

2370
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:17.510
And there were foremans and there were workers and there were people of every

2371
02:12:17.511 --> 02:12:19.670
level and they had to fit into their society.

2372
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:24.920
They weren't a disorganized rabble and they weren't all slaves being whipped to

2373
02:12:24.921 --> 02:12:27.960
do this.
They were,
yeah,
they thought they were motivated.

2374
02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:31.700
They knew about eternity.
Eternity was a real thing.

2375
02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:36.680
<v 1>The new by their diets,
the diets showed that they were,
um,</v>

2376
02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:40.400
that they were skilled workers.
Yup.
And that beer is a,
is a,

2377
02:12:40.401 --> 02:12:44.570
is a nutritious food as well as,
I didn't tweet this,

2378
02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:48.410
we've been alive this whole time with,
I cheated in the beginning,

2379
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:51.190
but I should probably go pretty soon to you.
Uh,
Greg,

2380
02:12:51.210 --> 02:12:53.380
I've got a parent that I'm working on.
You got a pyramid.

2381
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:55.640
Just finished lacing the laying the base stones,

2382
02:12:55.641 --> 02:12:58.520
but I think they're off back couple of centimeters and I'm going to be real

2383
02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:02.000
trouble when I get those Mayan workers these days.
Dude,

2384
02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:06.670
you got to watch them every step of the way.
They get on cheap booze.
They,
um,

2385
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:09.560
when they did like examinations of the,
the camp sites,

2386
02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:13.820
they found like really expensive foods like chicken bones and you know,

2387
02:13:13.821 --> 02:13:15.830
like that,
you know,
meats that are expensive.

2388
02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:17.570
So they knew that these people weren't slaves.

2389
02:13:17.571 --> 02:13:19.160
These people were still skilled workers.

2390
02:13:19.190 --> 02:13:22.880
That's how you now they're not eating chitlins the really nutty numbers and when

2391
02:13:22.881 --> 02:13:24.710
you break down how long it would take to build one,

2392
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:27.950
the Great Pyramid of Giza is 2 million,
300,000 stones.

2393
02:13:27.951 --> 02:13:30.470
So if you cut and place 10 stones a day,

2394
02:13:30.710 --> 02:13:35.220
it would you 664 years.
We don't know.
We don't know how long it

2395
02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:39.240
<v 2>took them,
but that pyramids were old.
What do they say?
The age of Cleopatra,</v>

2396
02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:44.100
which is 2000 ish ears.
Right.
Uh,

2397
02:13:44.190 --> 02:13:48.090
to us,
cause she was alive when Julio Caesar was alive and she lived til what,

2398
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.480
1980 or something.
Uh,
or,
or,

2399
02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:56.440
or BC right before a d or CE as they say now.
Um,

2400
02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.540
is closer to us than she was to the pyramids.
Yeah.
Isn't that incredible?

2401
02:14:00.570 --> 02:14:05.340
The parameds.
We're so old when Cleopatra,
the last of the pharaohs was existent.

2402
02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:09.150
But then did you see that other day,
and I'm sure you saw this,
John Tyler,

2403
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:14.040
the president from the 1840s two grandchildren alive.
Grand Children,

2404
02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:16.710
not great grandchildren,
not great,
great grandchild ran.

2405
02:14:16.730 --> 02:14:19.560
He had kids like late into his sixties he had kids,

2406
02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:22.920
very old and with two different women who are quite younger than him.

2407
02:14:23.130 --> 02:14:28.130
And then they had their kids had kids when they were very old.

2408
02:14:28.770 --> 02:14:29.071
Here's,

2409
02:14:29.071 --> 02:14:33.330
that's how it's only two bloody generations to go back to before the civil war.

2410
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.610
God Nest,
they're old.

2411
02:14:35.611 --> 02:14:37.860
They're in their late eighties early nineties but it's still,

2412
02:14:37.861 --> 02:14:42.540
think about the [inaudible].
That's what you know,
like you said,

2413
02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:46.140
the ancientness of the,
how would you be able to build a pyramid like that?
Well,

2414
02:14:46.141 --> 02:14:50.190
if you had zillions of workers,
well organized,
well fed,

2415
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:52.160
and if in a,
in a,
a benefit,

2416
02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:55.620
a society that was able to produce that kind of access,

2417
02:14:55.621 --> 02:14:59.050
that you were able to feed that many people and put on a giant project like
that.

2418
02:14:59.051 --> 02:15:01.230
And,
and they're not even the first one's right there,

2419
02:15:01.231 --> 02:15:03.390
the third or fourth incarnation appearing right.

2420
02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:06.720
Cause there's the one that stepped pyramid first,
and then the other one,

2421
02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:09.670
<v 1>you know,
they don't even think that now there's,
there's no,</v>

2422
02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:11.670
there's a very controversial,
uh,

2423
02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:16.100
theories involving the ages and the variations and the ages.
And there's,

2424
02:15:16.130 --> 02:15:20.330
there's some stuff that they've uncovered that is like the same methods of

2425
02:15:20.331 --> 02:15:24.680
construction that they used,
uh,
like with the,
uh,
the Sphinx Temple.

2426
02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.530
So one of the reasons why they want to backdate the Sphinx Temple,

2427
02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:30.950
the really the John Anthony West and the Robert Schoch sees the geologists and

2428
02:15:30.951 --> 02:15:34.100
they want to keep resonating.
They want it back.
Well,

2429
02:15:34.101 --> 02:15:36.670
there's evidence for it now because of go Beckley tappy,

2430
02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:40.040
which is that civilization they found in Turkey.
That's giant,

2431
02:15:40.041 --> 02:15:43.940
massive stone columns,
concentric circles.
And it's 14,000 years old.

2432
02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:46.740
And they're like,
Holy Shit,
because we are,

2433
02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.960
when you're talking about the pyramids,

2434
02:15:47.961 --> 02:15:52.400
you're talking about 5,000 plus years ago.
Yeah.
2,500 BC.

2435
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:56.900
Think about that.
So from then back,
just from then back,

2436
02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:00.140
you're talking about an additional 9,000 years.

2437
02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.360
Jesus fucking Christ,

2438
02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:07.280
and they were able to have high technology that's 5,000 years from us,

2439
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:09.680
which we presume the years before them,

2440
02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:13.490
so almost doubled the time between us and the construction of the pyramids.

2441
02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:14.900
Back to go back.
Lee Tapping.

2442
02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:19.960
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
So that means they had writing belief systems,
agriculture.</v>

2443
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:21.160
They have the technology make

2444
02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:22.240
<v 1>giant stone structure,</v>

2445
02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:25.330
which is the real mind blower because that was what it was always argued about.

2446
02:16:25.331 --> 02:16:26.710
The backdating of the Sphinx.

2447
02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:29.380
They would like what civilization existed because they trying to,

2448
02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:33.190
John Anthony West,
Robert Schoch,
we're trying to say that there's erosion marks.

2449
02:16:33.191 --> 02:16:37.600
Robert Schoch is a geologist and he said there is clear water erosion marks all

2450
02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:40.420
over the temple.
The Sphinx were,
the blocks were cut out.

2451
02:16:40.690 --> 02:16:45.160
The last time there was significant rainfall and the Nile Valley was 9,000 BC.

2452
02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:48.670
So you would need thousands of years of rainfall previous to that.

2453
02:16:48.671 --> 02:16:53.610
So you're talking eleven thousand ten thousand BC,
which is holy fucking shit.

2454
02:16:53.611 --> 02:16:56.560
That man looks alive.
That's twelve thousand thirteen thousand years ago.

2455
02:16:56.561 --> 02:16:59.540
That's the pleistocene.
That's 72 cats.
Let's get a say.

2456
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:02.200
There's giant animals still.
We're making sphinxes.

2457
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:06.370
They were making these temples,
they were building complex patterns in stone.

2458
02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:10.420
Then the,
the,
the old kingdom stuff they find like buried deep,
deep,

2459
02:17:10.421 --> 02:17:13.780
deep in the ground is this older version of construction that doesn't have

2460
02:17:13.781 --> 02:17:18.781
hieroglyphs on it and it's still massive stone structures but cut into more

2461
02:17:18.821 --> 02:17:22.690
distinct pattern of larger stones.
So the variations in the,

2462
02:17:22.691 --> 02:17:25.150
in the models and the way they built him,

2463
02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:28.870
there's a lot of people that think they might have gotten less advanced as time

2464
02:17:28.871 --> 02:17:31.120
went on and a lot of the shitty pyramids,

2465
02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:34.870
what might've been like later Pharaoh's they're like,
build me a magnificent.

2466
02:17:35.490 --> 02:17:39.190
And they were like,
uh,
don't how to do it anymore.
We lost the cold.

2467
02:17:39.191 --> 02:17:43.480
The numbers get a Janky contractors out there fucking slap it together.

2468
02:17:43.481 --> 02:17:46.240
Some shitbag pyramid and people are trying to say that these are the first

2469
02:17:46.241 --> 02:17:50.320
pyramid.
Well,
they might not be.
You're right.
It's hard to backdate stone.

2470
02:17:50.321 --> 02:17:51.130
You know,
they,

2471
02:17:51.130 --> 02:17:54.430
they take like little organic bits in between the stones and things that are

2472
02:17:54.431 --> 02:17:56.320
buried near the stones,
but you know,

2473
02:17:56.530 --> 02:18:01.360
they're pretty sure the Great Pyramid of Giza,
2,500 BC pretty sure,

2474
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:04.270
and it didn't come out of nowhere.

2475
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:08.410
No giant engineering feat that's still standing.

2476
02:18:08.470 --> 02:18:11.170
I think I need to go there.
I'm scared because of the civil unrest there.

2477
02:18:11.290 --> 02:18:12.730
John Anthony West says,
don't worry about it.

2478
02:18:12.731 --> 02:18:15.550
It's nothing we do that my wife keep having this discussion.

2479
02:18:15.551 --> 02:18:18.540
We keep wanting to go from crystals.
That's the place to go,
man.

2480
02:18:18.550 --> 02:18:20.790
That's the motherfucker all motherfucker.

2481
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:24.900
That's the big mind fuck of civilization.
These,
the big spotted,

2482
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:26.260
they do that 2 million,

2483
02:18:26.261 --> 02:18:30.850
300,000 stones the way between the two and some of them way up to as much as 80

2484
02:18:30.851 --> 02:18:35.410
tons and the intricacy of what's inside and beneath it.
The whole complex,

2485
02:18:35.411 --> 02:18:36.460
the whole system around there.

2486
02:18:36.490 --> 02:18:39.160
And then there's things that they're like the 10 that were covered.

2487
02:18:39.161 --> 02:18:44.161
Of course they're covered with beautiful limestone in the gold cap and they use

2488
02:18:44.531 --> 02:18:49.000
that limestone to build some little patches of it.
Yes.
Yeah.

2489
02:18:49.001 --> 02:18:52.450
It's a mind fuck.
Yeah,
I was gonna say the query it,
they basically just quiet.

2490
02:18:52.450 --> 02:18:52.990
The parents.

2491
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:56.590
Assholes came along and destroyed one of the greatest structures known to man

2492
02:18:56.620 --> 02:19:00.580
and it's still there.
It's so big butt down.
I don't,

2493
02:19:00.581 --> 02:19:03.490
I don't think you can appreciate that unless you're there.
I got to go there,

2494
02:19:03.491 --> 02:19:06.600
but I don't want to limit it to two.
I would just love it if somehow there,

2495
02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:11.190
but you know what the price is now our trip.
Oh yeah,

2496
02:19:11.470 --> 02:19:13.990
for sure.
We were on the other night the other day and they're like,

2497
02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:16.900
it's things that would've cost you a fortune before,
like half price,

2498
02:19:16.901 --> 02:19:19.900
but then you have to be able to deal with getting out of there.

2499
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:24.310
If you were Anthony Bordain,
you just fly in and out of fucking Bat Cape.

2500
02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:27.980
He got it goes all these fucking crazy places.
He goes to Libya,

2501
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:32.530
he goes everywhere and he just takes that risk and just go.
It's a small crew to,

2502
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:36.700
or four ps.
One.
If you're by yourself,
if a war breaks out,
you're fucked.

2503
02:19:36.710 --> 02:19:40.520
A doodle do,
then that's the thing about taking your family.
Yes.
Well,

2504
02:19:40.521 --> 02:19:41.900
he goes Solo.
He doesn't bring his family,

2505
02:19:41.901 --> 02:19:45.140
but he went to Beirut and war broke out and do you remember that episode?

2506
02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:49.130
Episode,
man,
that upset mother fucker.
That was crazy.
And then how do you get out?

2507
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:51.270
You can't.
You've got to wait it out.
And you,

2508
02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:52.730
who knows if your hotel is going to get here,

2509
02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:55.520
who knows how extreme it is going to get?
Yeah.
Who knows who has a nuke?

2510
02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:56.670
Who's gonna?

2511
02:19:56.670 --> 02:20:00.560
Who's gonna read I rocket launch you fucking rental car scraped proofs.

2512
02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.690
But you know,
we do know you're not going to get nuked.

2513
02:20:02.691 --> 02:20:07.440
If you go to Greg proops.com and pick up your special at Musso and Frank's,

2514
02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:11.090
you're not going to get nuked,
folks.
This is actually protection against nuked.

2515
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:15.510
We can say that with 100% money back guarantee payable only to the people who

2516
02:20:15.511 --> 02:20:18.440
got nuked.
You know why?
Because if you get nuked,
you're fucking,

2517
02:20:18.441 --> 02:20:20.230
you never going to collect and now you're never going to class.

2518
02:20:20.330 --> 02:20:24.350
You're going to be a warm enveloping glow of humor and good attitude.

2519
02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:28.130
It's n I n clad guarantee.
Greg Proops.

2520
02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:29.990
It's not even disingenuous.

2521
02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:34.360
I told me I was crazy to sell it for $4 but she couldn't stop me.

2522
02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:37.250
She can't stop hearing you are.
You are men and that control.

2523
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:41.920
You're a a man who's got the balls to film his comedy special at a restaurant.

2524
02:20:41.930 --> 02:20:45.720
A restaurant on the floor.
Yeah.
It gives zero fucks.
There's no stage now.

2525
02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:49.580
There wasn't.
There's no makeup.
There's a jazz band though.
Oh,
well that's nice.

2526
02:20:49.970 --> 02:20:51.980
It's nice to have jazz band.
I wish I had of jasmine.

2527
02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:54.740
That's when you're real gangster.
You've got your own barber and a jazz band.

2528
02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:59.480
I now a barbarous waiting for you.
His full time job is waking every day.

2529
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:03.410
That's what I love about the old days.
Every day a shaving us gentle trim.

2530
02:21:04.250 --> 02:21:08.180
Hey Chantelle style and the trim.
A little powder on the neck.
Right?

2531
02:21:08.350 --> 02:21:12.830
Watch a business simply for the weekend,
gentlemen.
Yeah,

2533

but she's seven o'clock.

2534
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:24.010
There's nobody better suited to the improvisational aspects of a live podcast

2535
02:21:24.081 --> 02:21:28.150
format.
The way you're doing it,
then you,

I really enjoyed talking to you every time I have you on the flag.

2538

All right,</v>

2564
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:15.230
we will see you.
We got a great group of spa of a podcast guests.

2565
02:23:15.231 --> 02:23:20.210
Next week we got a Greg Fitzsimmons.
We got um,

2566
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:23.930
Jesus Christ.
Who else is a coming out?
Oh,
a Dunkin and Chris Ryan.

2567
02:23:23.931 --> 02:23:27.800
We're doing our threesome podcast.
Uh,
we're doing that on Tuesday though.

2568
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:30.920
We've been,
the response has been insane for those podcasts.
So we've,

2569
02:23:30.921 --> 02:23:34.940
we've all committed to one a month.
One m w I'm doing,
we're doing mine this time.

2570
02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:37.850
Next time we do Dunkin's and then we do Chris Ryan's and we keep going in this

2571
02:23:37.851 --> 02:23:41.540
loop.
So,
uh,
I think that'll turn people on to two really great podcasts.

2572
02:23:41.541 --> 02:23:43.700
Duncan trussell's a family hour,

2573
02:23:43.701 --> 02:23:47.480
and Christopher Ryan's a tangentially speaking.

2574
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:51.800
It should be the Christopher Ryan show.
I'm s I don't want complication,
man.

2575
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:53.420
Why you fucking with my head man?

2576
02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:56.780
But that's going to be fun to talk to those guys next week.
Uh,

2577
02:23:56.810 --> 02:23:59.930
lots of other great guests coming up too.
We've got lots of fun stuff.

2578
02:24:00.050 --> 02:24:04.220
So see you guys soon.
And,
uh,
that's it.
Big Kiss.
Enjoy your weekend.
