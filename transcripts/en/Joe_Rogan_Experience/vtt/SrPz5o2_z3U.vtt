00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.870
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.500
or perhaps good evening if you're in internet time zone,

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.230
what does that even mean if you somewhere else on the planet.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.620
That's what I'm trying to say.
Ah,
this episode.
And by the way,
they would just,

5
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.990
we just had another thing where we had to go forward in time.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.770
Did you get that right?
Yeah,
it's tough.
Jumped for it.
Me,
amber.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.260
Especially when you're at a bar hammered.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.680
My Dad was an hour late picking me up at the airport yesterday.
Of course.

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.830
Cause he forgot this episode is brought to you by stamps.com.

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.380
Here's a way to save time.
Other than that,

11
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.460
going to the er or going to the post office to send your packages,

12
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:38.670
it's always a pain in the ass.
Uh,
getting the measures on a scale.

13
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.600
And if you're running a small business and you're selling shit online,

14
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.690
if you're not,
you should do that.
Cause it's a way better than having a boss.

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
But stamps.com is a way that you can do it all from the comfort of your own home

16
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.280
with your own home computer and a regular printer.

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.170
You can print us postage right there in your office.
Uh,

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.130
they give you a free digital scale.
If you use the code word j,

19
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.770
R E and they're $110 bonus offer,

20
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.960
which includes $55 of free postage and a free digital scale that you are not to

21
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.961
use for mushrooms and you can measure your packages and print official us

22
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:20.931
postage right there from your office and send it through stamps.com it saves you

23
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.020
a ton of money and you know,
all you have to do is package everything up,

24
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.070
printed up,
put the labels on,
give them to the post man,
thank you.

25
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.190
You cut a whole process out.
If the postage changes,

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.850
stamps.com is on the ball ahead of time so you don't have to worry about it.

27
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.550
And you really shouldn't be fucking complaining about postage.
I'm so tired.

28
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.290
But the students went up to 40 minutes

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.560
is the bargain of the universe 49 cents and you can take a piece of paper across

30
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:50.190
the country that's fucking ridiculous that you would even complain about that.

31
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:54.030
And some dude in shorts will bring it to your door and they have a car that has

32
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.860
a steering wheel on the wrong side of the road

33
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.450
is a commitment to live delivering you mail anyway,

34
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:02.370
go to stamps.com before you do anything,

35
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:07.371
click on the microphone on the homepage and type in j r e that stamps.com j r e

36
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.800
were also brought to you by ting with ting is a mobile company that does things

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.431
well.

38
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:18.450
They they like to try to cut out all the bullshit that you'd normally get when

39
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:21.120
you have cell phone service.
All the bullshit like,

40
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.690
like early termination fees and these add ons that you weren't aware of when you

41
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.810
signed up for a contract.
They don't have contracts.

42
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:34.920
You can cancel anytime you want.
They sell you only what you use.

43
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.710
So instead of having not,
you have a hundred monthly minutes,

44
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.660
how often you fucking use a hundred minutes.

45
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:42.180
I mean shouldn't you just pay for what you use?

46
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:45.390
Well that's how Tang has it set up.
If you use more,
you pay more.

47
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.860
If you use less you pay less.

48
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:51.540
But the bottom line is that 98% of people would save money if they use ting.

49
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.750
Ting is also a company that uses this sprint backbone,

50
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.490
so it's a real cell phone provider.

51
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:59.470
It's not some Mickey Mouse Shit that somebody slapped together with tape.

52
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.460
It's fucking sprint and you can get a cell phone from them.

53
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:08.140
One of the highest end android phones available.
Like they have the HTC one,

54
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.320
which is a beautiful phone.
They have a Samsung phone,

55
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.350
the galaxy s four the galaxy note three.

56
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.350
They have all the high end beautiful android phones and you just feel better

57
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.840
about the transaction.
It's doesn't feel icky.

58
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.530
It feels like you're giving them money for a good service,

59
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.430
but you're not getting fucked with any weird shit that they tack on.

60
00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:30.640
It's like a burner phone.
Joe,

61
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:35.641
it sounds like what senators here to pick up mail and drug dealers in Baltimore?

62
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.420
No,
it's an awesome company.

63
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:41.440
Go to rogan.ting.com and save $25 off your first device.

64
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.870
You know they're also working with iPhones now.
Yes.

65
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.410
Just recently they started hello.
You know phones.
Yeah.
Which is great,

66
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:50.320
but you know,
the iPhone thing is,
uh,

67
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.610
I've got a weird thing going on with them because of this bitcoin thing.

68
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.560
I think bitcoin is a fascinating subject and um,
yeah,

69
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:02.230
there's going to be people that blow a lot of money on it.
There's going to be,

70
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:05.410
it's going to go up and down.
I mean,
there's a lot going on with it.

71
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.180
People may be trying to sabotage it,

72
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.510
but the bottom line is you can't get an apple bitcoin wallet APP.

73
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.280
Like they canceled their app to App,
had 120,000 downloads.
I don't know.

74
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:17.440
But that's disrespectful to the community,

75
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.210
to the bitcoin community in my opinion.

76
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.610
I don't know if bitcoin is ever going to work out or not work out,

77
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.890
but I do know that I can,

78
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.990
I don't want to support a company that does something like that.

79
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.740
Like if if these applications or doing something deceptive,

80
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.760
then I think there should be some sort of a press release explaining what

81
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.060
deceptive practices were being done by these apps that made you remove them.

82
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:42.061
But I find it odd if I can get all these different bitcoin wallets for Android,

83
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.240
but when I look on iPhone,
this fucking nothing.
I don't,
that's,

84
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.940
that can't be a coincidence.
You can't tell me that,

85
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.360
that Google is so negligent that they allow these people to get on their,

86
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:58.690
their,
their network and sell these apps and no one is,

87
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.230
no one's stopping all the exploits.
No one's stopping on the bullshit.

88
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.860
Or is apple just keeping them from coming on their platform?
Who knows?

89
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.990
It's interesting.
I think this is a,

90
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.480
a critical time for something like a bitcoin because it's what it's not even

91
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:13.990
about.

92
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.990
It might not even about bitcoin and might be about what bitcoin becomes and you

93
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:22.030
know,
people saying it's not perfect.
They want to kill it.
Like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

94
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:25.990
Whoa,
Whoa,
slow the fuck down.
Why would you kill this?
Like what is this?

95
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.290
Let's look at what this could be.
Because what it is right now,

96
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.520
it's like some sort of a computer program and a new form of currency,

97
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.060
but if you kill it,
it never grows into what it could have become.

98
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.110
We money used to be fucking knots on a rope.
Okay.

99
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.990
It used to be like these weird handmade coins made of precious metals.
Right?

100
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.620
And now it's paper like how did it and now it's numbers.
It's ones and Zeros.

101
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.540
It's numbers in a computer somewhere.

102
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.850
You can't tell me that money can't evolve like everything else,

103
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.980
like fucking processing

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 1>system.
Like,
like,
like a computer,
like,
like a television.</v>

105
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.060
Things get more complex,
they get better.
They tightened down,

106
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:08.600
they figured out if you've got all these smart people working on this bit coin

107
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.110
thing,

108
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.160
cause a lot of really intelligent people invested in this idea of making the

109
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.910
economy more stable with this sort of a currency,

110
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.240
a currency that can't be fucked with or trace.
That's fascinating.
I like,

111
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.490
isn't it like more a not,
it's more anonymous that's yes.
Yes.
It's more anonymous.

112
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.090
You know what,
man,
I think that we,

113
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:33.470
the idea of only going the way we're going and only using the methods that we're

114
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.730
using right now.
It's ridiculous.

115
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.780
<v 2>I think it's ridiculous.
Well,
and also the upper level of a,</v>

116
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:43.180
of currency trading is always has been virtual for a long time.
You know,

117
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.490
when banks borrow overnight rates and all that kind of stuff,
there's no,

118
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.120
there's no movement of paper going on.
It's just a computer click here,
there.

119
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.640
Yeah,
we got way off track.
This is supposed to be a tin commercial,

120
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.510
but I get fucking crazy when it comes to these things.

121
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.400
And I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I met,

122
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:02.570
I met a guy at a wedding years ago who's a world famous seashell expert.

123
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.280
I sat with him at the same table,

124
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:07.820
so we were chatting boring wedding and that sounds like a boring fucking

125
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.654
conversation.

126
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.780
Double check it out like this guy because it came up because you know,

127
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.560
Cassie mentioned Mozambican.
He's like,
Oh,

128
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.930
I've been to Mozambique four times collecting shells.

129
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:21.350
It's like this amazing place.
So I mean,
the guy goes all over the world.
Anyway,

130
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:23.780
he told me,
you know how we're talking about currency.

131
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.640
When the Dutch supposedly bought Manhattan Island from the Indians for Wampum,

132
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.450
right.
They paid them in Wampum and what wampum was as most school kids,

133
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.100
no seashells,
like sewn onto a belt.
Right?
Yeah.

134
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.030
But what he told me was that there are a particular type of seashell that only

135
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.750
grew in this one bay that was controlled by this one tribe.

136
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.860
So they sort of had a monopoly.
It's like the America,
the dollar at this point,

137
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:52.100
the reserve currency.
Right.
And it would emanate out from there.

138
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:56.210
So with the touch did was they went and figuring out what shell it was and they

139
00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.860
figured out how to cultivate that mollusk themselves.

140
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.910
So within a couple of years they had an unlimited supply.
Counterfeit counter.

141
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.190
Exactly,
man.
That's the story.

142
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.530
And all currency you can fuck with all currents.
Yeah.
By definition,

143
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:18.680
whatever,
you know,
it always has been that way.
Yeah.
But now it's,

144
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.490
it's all virtual.
It doesn't mean there's not even a coin to fake anymore.
Well,

145
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:24.380
it's not the whole,
I guess we already done these commercials.
Right?

146
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.740
Did we say rugged.ting.com we did.
Right.
So it's just not even playing music.

147
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.000
Just keep going.
It feels weird when you break up conversations like this,

148
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.231
<v 1>but wasn't,</v>

149
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:37.010
the idea about gold and precious minerals being there is very few of them is a

150
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.400
finite amount.
Right?
So that this is a good thing to base money on because it's,

151
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.791
you know,

152
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.700
people have sort of always kind of recognize it's gotta be like a way to put a

153
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:48.230
cap on it.
Yes.
Kind of way the lane to keep this thing,

154
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.880
it doesn't totally make sense for controlling everything about me.

155
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:57.510
You think about what money really is.
It's so,
it's cause it's not human.

156
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.680
Okay.
It's not thinking,
but it seems to be an organism.

157
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.010
It seems to be something that requires you to love it.

158
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:10.250
So it allows you to connect yourself to all these material items that fill up

159
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.880
this weird hole in your,
your idea of the world.

160
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.960
I'll tell you what is,
it pulls up perception.
Perception.
It's a western Gollad,

161
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.970
right?
Because it's power hungry.
It accumulates power.
It's jealous.

162
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:26.220
It doesn't want any other currencies in existence.

163
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:30.870
It wants to control the market and it only works if everybody believes in it.

164
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.740
Okay.

165
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.680
<v 3>That's,
uh,
that is,
uh,
that's the,
uh,
dark way to put it.</v>

166
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.420
I've heard it put a positive way,

167
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:41.160
which is it just represents the life flow at represents this flow of energy

168
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.050
that's always coming through the universe.

169
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.710
And it's kind of like one manifestation of that energy flow.

170
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:50.310
And if you look at it like that instead of demonizing and which I've definitely

171
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:55.050
done in the past and just see it as just this thing that sort of,
uh,
it's a,

172
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.200
it's like you,
we know when you throw paint on the invisible man or something,

173
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:03.000
you know,
like it reveals this kind of flow through the universe.

174
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.290
That's where you get into the secret stuff.
You know,
like if you very generous,

175
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:08.370
more comes back.

176
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.060
<v 1>Yeah.
But don't you think that money does have characteristics?</v>

177
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:14.751
I mean,

178
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:18.200
don't you think there are predictable things that happen to a person's life on a

179
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.720
bunch of money comes into it?
Yeah,
no doubt.

180
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.390
And I think money is objectively toxic.

181
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.180
<v 3>You think so?
I,
I,
you know,
I think it's not,</v>

182
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.840
it's literally toxic when you consider all the disgusting people who grow,

183
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:34.380
handle that shit.
All the fierce sweat that soaks into it.

184
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.670
<v 1>Cocaine.
Huh?
I don't think that money's inherently toxic.</v>

185
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.890
I think people with power are inherently toxic.

186
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.930
I don't think it has anything to do with money.

187
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.140
I think the real corrupting factor of money is that they want someone at the,

188
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.770
if you,
everybody wants it.
Okay.
And so if everybody wants it,

189
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.480
it's someone at some point in time's going to try to control the flow of other

190
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:00.180
people acquiring it because then it will interfere with them.

191
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.360
And so then it becomes this chimpanzee competition thing.

192
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.980
It's not that money is toxic because you can take wealthy people who make a lot

193
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:11.550
of money,
who do a lot of good things with it and they seem to be really nice,

194
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.551
you know,
and they,

195
00:11:12.551 --> 00:11:16.950
they have this ability to help and affect all sorts of other folks like Bill

196
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.300
Gates.
I don't know anything about Bill Gates,

197
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.520
but what I know about watching Bill Gates is,
is like constant charity work.
Okay.

198
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.340
Let me Mac to where you started.
Right?

199
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.900
With the apple shutting down bitcoin.
Right.
The way Bill Gates got rich,

200
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:34.890
the way Microsoft got where they are is by shutting down competition.

201
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.740
Every time somebody rows that would challenge windows,

202
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:40.080
they would shut it down by him out drive them out of business.

203
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.240
They're like the Walmart of software.

204
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:45.390
That's where everybody bitches about how shitty windows is.
But like there's no,

205
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.070
you can't not use windows if you're in a big company in the 90s yeah.

206
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.050
Well that's also because they got a stronghold on the market.

207
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:54.330
When apple was shit,
I mean apple

208
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 0>was really Dalit.
Anybody else come up?
Well,</v>

209
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:01.090
apple wouldn't let anybody sell their operating system and just attach it to a

210
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.850
computer.
When you buy an apple computer,
you buy it from them.

211
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.170
The East have clones.

212
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.180
He said these apple clones you could buy and then they shut those clones down

213
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:13.750
and people got really pissed and business is also like the old apples were dog

214
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:14.200
shit.

215
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.200
They were bad and when windows came out there was so many good things about

216
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:22.810
Windows operating system as opposed to the old OSX.

217
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.430
Like there's something about the way the operating system worked that it was,

218
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:29.320
it was really bad with multitasking.

219
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.790
So I tried it was another way I thought the apple,
okay.
Apple,
uh,

220
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:38.770
operating systems sort of led the way and windows copied them?
No,
no,
no,

221
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:42.040
no,
no.
There's,
there's definitely some copying back and forth from each other.

222
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.640
But the original way of using a user interface,
a graphic user interface,

223
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.060
it was invented by Xerox.
They invented the first computer that worked like that.

224
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:51.550
Everything else was a terminal that you'd have to just punch in coat.

225
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.900
They figured out how to do that first and then apple and then windows copied

226
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:59.500
that.
But the,
so what,
it's just a graphic user interface.
I mean like what,

227
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:04.480
what's going on behind the scenes?
Well,
the old days before Osx,

228
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.590
apple had no memory protection,
no preemptive multitasking,

229
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:11.560
like the old operating systems,
the old operating operating systems for apple.

230
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:12.610
We were like really shitty.

231
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.390
So then they changed it to go with a windows platform to go to the Intel

232
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:16.881
platform.

233
00:13:16.881 --> 00:13:19.990
When they couldn't get anything more out of that IBM computer that they used to

234
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:22.030
sell,
they couldn't get any more juice out of it.

235
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:24.580
And then the windows computers were getting up to like one gigahertz.

236
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.650
So they just jumped ship and went to Intel,

237
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:28.540
had to change everything you're talking about the chip.

238
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.050
They had to change their process from,
they had to change their processes.

239
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.860
And by the way,
if I butchered any of this real true computer cakes I apply now.

240
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.980
So impressed.
Whatever you,
the multitasking.
Preemptive multitask.
Wow.

241
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.150
The ability to do well.
I think a lot of times when like today,

242
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.250
windows is awesome with that.
So it was Mac,

243
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.860
you can run a bunch of different programs at the same time,

244
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.370
but it used to be like if you wanted to,
iTunes wasn't around back then,

245
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:54.911
but if you used to be,

246
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:58.540
if you wanted to open up iTunes and also have a browser running and also,

247
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.080
you know,
be checking your Twitter feed,
a Twitter application,

248
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.550
you'd have a real fucking problem.

249
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.890
Especially if you're trying to play a video online as well,

250
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:09.430
then your computer's just getting shit itself and now that's super common place.

251
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.190
But one of the reasons it says there's just more,

252
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.570
the operating system is far more complex and it's a unix based operating system

253
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:21.550
now.
So when when when apple came around with Osx it was so far ahead of anything

254
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:22.331
else.
It's like windows.

255
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:26.020
She looked like a dinosaur in comparison and that's when I switched over.

256
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.300
The guys in the fear factor office had uh,
had these apple computers with Osx.

257
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.990
Like for whatever reason,
Hollywood has always been like super,
super apple,

258
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.280
like every having like apple evangelists on sense graphics.

259
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.970
But then yet I just that I remember when Apple Shit all over final cut,

260
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:47.170
remember that they did that update to find out nerfed it and turned it into this

261
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:51.230
like baby machine or something.
Right.
Dan stopped using it.
Well,

262
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:52.070
so did my brother,
my

263
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.070
<v 3>brother's a a video editor in DC and he and he switched to a PC and the new</v>

264
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.190
window system is pretty amazing,
man.
I've used it.
It's really cool.

265
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.880
I like it a lot,
but new window system for video editing,
is that what you mean?

266
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.890
Well,
no,
just the wind,
the new windows,

267
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:09.350
the operating system itself is so much different.

268
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.430
If you're used to like whenever you stopped using it,
if you revisit it now,

269
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.390
it's pretty cool,
man.
I sure it's cool.
I still use Mac though,

270
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:22.190
but I think one cool thing about windows is that it gives you the freedom to

271
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.600
fuck up your computer and that's cool man.
There's always some,

272
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:29.630
with apple you always feel like your hands are tied a little bit,
you know,

273
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.450
they're always trying to control shit.
They took flash away.

274
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.440
Remember when they did that?

275
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.490
Right after I learned to code and action script a little bit.

276
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.720
Those motherfuckers started launching photon missiles into flash and ever since

277
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:45.270
then I've had a sour taste over apple because I think the room,

278
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.190
there was a reason there was a bunch of security exploits with flash though

279
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.760
wasn't there?
Who Cares?

280
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.870
Let me destroy my God damn computer if I want to and my life.

281
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:57.320
It's the attitude of like the older,
the older I get,

282
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:59.210
the more grading it becomes.

283
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:02.660
When you realize you're being protected from destroying yourself,
it's like,

284
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:06.920
stop it.
Let me do,
let me do this.
If this is what I'm compelled to do.
Well,

285
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:09.740
especially when it's been proven that the things we're trying to prevent you

286
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:12.450
from doing aren't harmful.
Oftentimes like hot,

287
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.650
just thinking about the money that's been spent on keeping potty illegal.

288
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.870
It of course everyone distrusts you now.

289
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.370
They're never going to listen to a God damn word.

290
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.960
You said you tried to keep pot from them.

291
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.470
What's one of the dumbest things the government has ever done is try to keep

292
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:28.550
plot from people.
Know you.
You smoke it,
you find out it's awesome.

293
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.150
You don't die,
and then he started distrusting everything.
Right.
Well,

294
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.050
masturbation.

295
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.960
Think about how many people thought they were going to die from masturbation.

296
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.740
Right?
You lose your mind.
You get hair on your poems when that's end.

297
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.610
That wasn't my time.
No.
Well,
there are a little this Catholic,
no,
no,

298
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:47.360
I'm talking about earlier times,
early 20th century,
19th century.
You know,

299
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.040
I remember her that you were going to go blind or any,
oh yeah,
there were,

300
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.250
there are medical books in the 19th century.

301
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.540
Kellogg had this whole thing about it.
You know,
the,
the,
it causes insanity.

302
00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.470
Insanity.
It causes hair to grow in your poems.
You know,

303
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.230
the weird ability Kellogg from Kellogg cereal,
right?
Yeah.

304
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.950
He had a thing.
He was very robust.

305
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.800
Deauville people who masturbate.
You had think about that.
I mean,

306
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:14.630
the whole thing with corn flakes,

307
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.910
the reason corn flakes were invented was to stop boys from masturbating.

308
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.430
How was that?
How was the idea behind that?
Explained this to us before.

309
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.060
The idea is that spicy foods excite the sensibilities.

310
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.340
And so if you eat something that tastes interesting,

311
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:33.140
you're going to want to come.
So they,
they invented and also Graham crackers.

312
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.660
Graham was another of these big ante,

313
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:40.661
masturbation evangelizers so they invent these really intentionally bland foods.

314
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.023
You know,

315
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.550
they like to keep the teenage boys from jerking off so that when they finger,

316
00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:48.710
they're assholes.
They immediately come.

317
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.050
<v 4>Exactly.
It's like veal.</v>

318
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.460
Keep them in the dark.
Oh,
that's so true.

319
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.730
I'm so fucking horny.
Anything,
Spin your finger.
Father

320
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.360
just touch me.
Squirt fucking mountains.

321
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.010
What am I gay now?
Shit
could milk itself.

322
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:17.940
That would be bad.

323
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:26.620
And it can climb fences.
Cows a Kelly does yoga and can reach it.

324
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.940
Someone teats account.
It's so smart.
It realizes how fucking huge is.

325
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:31.660
I could just run through that fence anytime.

326
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.140
Which shitty wooden fences these keep cows in with.
It's unbelievable.

327
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.420
You know how they train elephants?

328
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.690
You know that you see these elephants that are like Tai chained to something and

329
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:45.810
the elephant could just pull it out the way they train them.
When they're,

330
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.080
when they're babies,
they chained them to uh,

331
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.130
something really heavy that they can't pull.

332
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.740
And then the elephant for the rest of its life is like,
oh man,

333
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:54.040
when that chains on I can't pull it.

334
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.050
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
You know?
Um,
I have a friend who keeps cows.</v>

335
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:03.110
He's got like these grass fed cows and he's got this big farm and he butchered a

336
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:06.900
cow every year.
And guess what?
Those fucking cows.
No,
it

337
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.420
is going on.
They don't know that he doesn't have like an old school.

338
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:13.141
He wouldn't fence.

339
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:17.010
He's got like a real fence that could keep the cows in but he doesn't.

340
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.023
What are you doing here man?

341
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.420
<v 4>Cause you're on Dixon is a tad can doodle.</v>

342
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.330
<v 1>It's now we're trying to be very sophisticated.
Um,
it's,</v>

343
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.660
the pads are great if you need to write something down in the middle of a show.

344
00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:33.140
I always wanted to have something like good preemptive multitasking written down

345
00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:36.590
here
might be a totally made up thing.

346
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.500
<v 4>That's how I avoid writing your friends.
Cows are paranoid</v>

347
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.121
<v 1>dude.</v>

348
00:19:41.121 --> 00:19:45.110
We went into his yard where the cows are in the cows fucking run from you and

349
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:49.700
they run from you.
And like this idea that people like to have of,
you know,

350
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.760
eating grass fed meat as being totally cool.

351
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.770
You know like listen cow grain fed cows bullshit but organic grass fed meat.

352
00:19:57.771 --> 00:20:02.450
Hey those cows lived a great life.
Guess what?
No they don't.
They live in fear.

353
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.360
Those fucking things are penned in and you don't think they know that.

354
00:20:05.361 --> 00:20:06.920
Every now and then one of them disappears.

355
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.590
<v 4>Did you ever read the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy w they had,</v>

356
00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:12.050
and it's a futuristic,
it was,

357
00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:15.970
there was a restaurant called the restaurant at the end of the universe.
And um,

358
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.501
people,

359
00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:19.830
you could go to that restaurant and watch the universe and like somehow it was

360
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:21.270
in a time portal,
but they,

361
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.220
cows would come to your table and they could talk and they would suggest which

362
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:30.090
parts of them you should eat.
Like they were like,
oh my God,
that's so creepy.

363
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.040
Yeah.

364
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.890
<v 1>If the world keeps going the way it's going,
that will eventually happen.</v>

365
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.910
We'll eventually,
the stope on cows,
the ability to want to die.

366
00:20:37.911 --> 00:20:39.470
I have no problem serving humans.

367
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.270
Give them a very simple mind and then have them trot around on two legs and walk

368
00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:47.350
around on their hind feet and explain what parts of their body they want you
eat.

369
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.020
That's it.

370
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.090
<v 2>Yeah.
They don't even have to die right away.
Right.</v>

371
00:20:50.091 --> 00:20:53.810
They can just have amputations.
So it keeps it really fresh.
Yeah.

372
00:20:53.811 --> 00:20:56.000
That could be ever see that there was a,

373
00:20:56.001 --> 00:21:00.770
there is like we're talking about the fucking military.
There's a cartoon in the,

374
00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:02.000
I think it was in the New Yorker,

375
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.240
it had a little frog coming out of the kitchen in a restaurant.
Right.

376
00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:06.590
Come through the door and he's on a,

377
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.850
on a skateboard and he's got the two things like this and it says special frog

378
00:21:10.851 --> 00:21:11.684
legs.

379
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.160
<v 0>Man,
that's hard.
Oh,
that's rough.
Yeah.
That would be worse though.</v>

380
00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:18.980
You'd have to actually take off the pelvis.
I mean,
you're not just cutting off,

381
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.650
you cutting off the leg at the socket for the frog.

382
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.610
<v 2>That's an amazing thing.
When you've convinced something to want to die.</v>

383
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.660
Like once you've done that,
you have really like you are in control.

384
00:21:29.661 --> 00:21:33.590
If you've got a being that you have convinced to die for you,

385
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.730
fuck well that would be the sort of powerful hero.

386
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.790
<v 0>Yeah.
Call them hero cow.
Here I'll be the sale.</v>

387
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.030
The sale would be that these cows have no problem dying.

388
00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:47.790
They actually want to die and they have no fear.

389
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.020
So what we're worried about is pain and fear.
Oh,
we remove their pain sensors.

390
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:55.230
They don't have any,
they don't feel any pain.
They just wander around.

391
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.510
And when you take him into the back room to slaughter them,

392
00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.403
it doesn't even freak out.

393
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.890
<v 2>Have an orgasm the whole way through.
It's like an ecstasy trip.</v>

394
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.060
But what about laboratory meet?
Have you seen this growing meat in a laboratory?

395
00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:09.960
So that'll be expensive.
No brain at all.
Right.
So the fear and the,

396
00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:14.440
and the pain or removed?
Probably the nervous system.
It's not as fun,
you know,

397
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.450
not as fun for whom that was fun for the person that gets to kill the animal,

398
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.550
you know,
they're going to,
I mean,

399
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.800
right now I don't know what kind of meat they're growing,

400
00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:25.950
but eventually that they're going to grow human meat.
Oh,
for sure.

401
00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:28.950
And the question is going to be,
if you grow human meat in a lab,
is it,

402
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:33.030
is it okay to eat then?
Yeah,
for sure.
That's common,
right?
I feel like,

403
00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.010
or is that cannibalism?
Right?
Well,

404
00:22:35.011 --> 00:22:38.160
I interesting because it didn't come off a human,
it just was grown.

405
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.700
So it'll certainly be thought of as cannibalism by a lot of people.
You know,

406
00:22:41.701 --> 00:22:45.530
what's really interesting about cannibalism,
do you know?
Would you know?

407
00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:49.980
Or cannibalism,
what causes cannibalism?
It's very hunger.
Hunger.
Exactly.

408
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.760
Um,
but there,
there are all these,
I always just thought like some people,

409
00:22:53.761 --> 00:22:56.400
some civilizations were cannibalistic in some warrant,
right?

410
00:22:56.401 --> 00:22:59.910
It was just like some evilness that got into some,
and not others randomly.

411
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.390
But it turns out that there's a biological reason for this.

412
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.200
There's a guy named Marvin Harris,
a great anthropologist.

413
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.910
It was at Columbia for a long time.

414
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.120
He wrote a about how he studied different islands in the South Pacific,

415
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:17.290
some of which were cannibalistic in,
some of which weren't,

416
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:18.900
and different societies around the world.

417
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.590
And what he found was that the societies that were cannibalistic had no,
uh,

418
00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:28.530
domesticate a bull animal that didn't eat the same food as humans.

419
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.560
In other words,
you,

420
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.660
you aren't going to raise dogs for me because dogs eat the same shit that humans

421
00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:36.240
eat,
right?
You went to raise animals for meat,

422
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.450
like goats that don't eat stuff that humans eat,

423
00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.030
so they're not competing for the same original food source.
Right?

424
00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:45.740
Then it's supplementary.
So like if you look the Aztecs,

425
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.700
there was nothing in Mexico that they could raised that they could domesticate

426
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:51.920
and raised for meat that didn't eat what humans aid.

427
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.050
So they were protein starved.

428
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.750
So when they were in a battle and they killed a bunch of dudes,

429
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:57.590
they would eat them.

430
00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:58.983
<v 1>Right.</v>

431
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.400
<v 2>Whereas the Europeans who killed just as many people if not more worn eating</v>

432
00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:06.760
them,
then consider that a sacrilege.
Because in Europe you had pigs,

433
00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:08.050
you had goats,
you had chickens,

434
00:24:08.051 --> 00:24:11.140
you had all these things that were easy to domesticate that humans had been

435
00:24:11.141 --> 00:24:14.830
living on for a long time.
So it's really a historical accident.

436
00:24:14.831 --> 00:24:16.720
Who's this cannibalistic and who isn't

437
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.640
<v 1>mansion if you were a European settler trying to make it across the country</v>

438
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:28.320
during the days of the native Americans,
like when you know,

439
00:24:28.321 --> 00:24:29.250
17 hundreds,

440
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.990
16 hundreds whenever they did that and you had after the first wave that had

441
00:24:33.991 --> 00:24:37.710
already gone over and basically committed genocide on many populations.

442
00:24:37.711 --> 00:24:40.980
And so you were the enemy and you were trying to make it across the country

443
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.800
without running into one of these people that might eat you.
Yeah.

444
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.780
You mean like a wagon train kind of people?
Yeah,
we'll,
Comanche is,
oh yeah.

445
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.570
It mean the Nez Perce apparently according to Steve Rinella,

446
00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:56.571
my friend Steve Rinella is a real historian on a native American history.

447
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.450
And um,
you know,
they had just the history of the colonization of this country.

448
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.860
But he told me these great stories about the Nez Perce Indians who are known for

449
00:25:04.861 --> 00:25:09.000
cannibalism.
They would lay with butcher people.
Really?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

450
00:25:09.001 --> 00:25:11.190
They would eat them like the same one.
They would eat cattle.

451
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.980
So if they would catch people,
some enemy or something like that,

452
00:25:13.981 --> 00:25:16.350
they would kill them and eat them.
And they,
they,

453
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.380
they made a regular habit of it then not only that,
they,

454
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.710
they would play games like they told this one dude,
they said,
uh,

455
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.160
they took all his clothes off and they let them run and they said,
uh,

456
00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:27.780
if you can get away,
you could survive.

457
00:25:27.781 --> 00:25:30.480
And they killed his friend in front of them.
Butcher dumb started eating them.

458
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.380
And they told him that if he,
if he can get away,
they're going to give him,

459
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.910
you know,
a 20 minute headstart or however,
whatever account they had.
Yeah.

460
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.720
You can get away.
It's right.
And the guy survived.

461
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.040
The guy made it to the river who went into a beaver den naked into a swam up

462
00:25:44.041 --> 00:25:46.240
into a beaver den to hide.
Yeah.

463
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:51.570
<v 3>What is the beaver in there?
Really?
The B might have been chuck,</v>

464
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:56.030
if you could go buy a beep beep or running till Hannibal's.

465
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.970
Viva just killed a person recently.
I believe it.

466
00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.820
They're scary dangerous creatures,
man.
They ain't chomp through histories

467
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.910
<v 1>killed by a beaver.
He got bitten by a beaver in the leg and he bled out.
Like,</v>

468
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:09.060
you don't realize this.
Thank you to take a fucking tree down with its face.
Yes.

469
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.510
Beavers.
You don't want to get bitten by a fucking beaver.
No,
you don't.

470
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.230
So this asshole climbs into this beaver den naked.
Okay.

471
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.980
To get away from these Nez Perce Indians and then he winds up walking some like

472
00:26:19.981 --> 00:26:23.910
a hundred miles or some fucking crazy shit.
Almost starving to death.

473
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:28.590
Just eating what he could find and kill along the way.
Naked,
naked,

474
00:26:28.591 --> 00:26:31.680
bad ass just to get the fuck away from these Nez Perce Indians who ate his

475
00:26:31.681 --> 00:26:32.514
friend in front of them.

476
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.390
<v 2>So that's how the Nez Perce.
That sounds more like the Iroquois.</v>

477
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:38.930
That sounds like eastern.
Who?
This fucking guy.

478
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.700
<v 1>Yeah,
look at that shit.
Muddy little devil.
He'll get it.
It's ready to,</v>

479
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 0>it's talking.
That's weird.
Jesus Christ.
She is that a beaver.</v>

480
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.220
So it says it looks at the flat tail.
It's a beaver that's going to fuck you up.

481
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.700
Either mean beavers.
Beavers can eat trees.
Man,

482
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.200
you don't want to fuck with a beaver.

483
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.090
And this guy was so scared of these Indians.

484
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:03.390
He climbed into the beavers house in the water in the night night.

485
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.860
Cause if you find one of these beaver,

486
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:07.650
Dan's like Rinella showed me how to find them.
When you're going down the river,

487
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:11.260
you see like these stacks of sticks.
It's weird sort of promotion information.

488
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.450
He's like,
that's a beaver den.

489
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.690
And he could tell by looking at it whether or not it's used or whether it's

490
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:19.080
abandoned because,
but this guy didn't know that shit cause it was at nighttime.

491
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.220
So he's running down this road and just jumps into the river and finds a beaver

492
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:24.900
den.
Just says,
fuck it.
Let's take a chance.

493
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:29.190
Swims up into it in the middle of the night.
Fucking a man.
They are so cool.

494
00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:29.641
Beavers.

495
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:34.350
When you consider that how radically they change environments that they make

496
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:38.520
lakes happen.
That's amazing.
They actually make lakes.

497
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.830
There's a great documentary on beavers that I saw.

498
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.840
Why do they call Vaginas beaver?

499
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:46.500
That's one of those things I've always kind of like for the old days.

500
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:48.810
Used to be for so many other things have for,

501
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.570
did you see that a thing that they had on Vimeo recently?

502
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:54.390
It's been going around the Internet.
How wolves changed the course of rivers.

503
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.130
It's amazing.
You haven't seen it?
No.
Oh my God.
Dot.
Can you got to see this?

504
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.540
It's incredible.
It's a,
it's a piece play look little experts,

505
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.130
Yellowstone of it.
It's Yellowstone and the introduction of wolves.
They've,

506
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.160
they've dwindled the population of deer and Antal and deer and elk down and

507
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.530
because they've made the populations lower,

508
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.710
the soil around rivers has gotten less erosion because more plants are growing

509
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:26.070
on it.
And then more,
uh,
more rodents or surviving,

510
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:30.930
more rabbits are surviving and then more bears and bears kill the Fonz like

511
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.500
it's,
and it changes literally because of the fact that there's more beavers.

512
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:39.030
It's changing the course of the river itself.
Yeah,
they're amazing.
I mean like,

513
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.640
oops.
It's amazing.
Their predation,

514
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.340
<v 5>the discovery of widespread trophic cascades,</v>

515
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.790
a trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food

516
00:28:51.801 --> 00:28:55.370
chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom.

517
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.460
And that's kind the classic example is what happens is so bad ass and more bad

518
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:00.340
ass United's.

519
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:05.350
This guy has an English accent we reintroduced in 1995 we all know that wolves

520
00:29:06.951 --> 00:29:09.380
killed various species of animals.

521
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.620
The press was slightly less aware that they give life to many others

522
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.950
before the wolf's turned up.

523
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.280
They'd been absent for 70 years that the numbers of deer,

524
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.320
because there was nothing to hunt had built up.

525
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:30.150
And built up in the Yellowstone park and despite efforts by humans to control

526
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:34.590
them,
that manage to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing.

527
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:38.880
They're just grazed it in a way.
But as soon as the wolves arrived,

528
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:40.350
even though there were few in number,

529
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.730
they started to have the most remarkable effects.
First,
of course,

530
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:46.810
they killed some of the deer,

531
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:50.320
but that wasn't the major thing much more significantly.

532
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.500
They radically changed the behavior of the deer.

533
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.620
The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,

534
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.050
the places where there could be trapped most easily,

535
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:01.330
particularly the valleys and the gorgeous.

536
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.920
And immediately those places started to regenerate in some areas.

537
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.660
The height of the trees quintupled in just six years,

538
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.940
it became on an animal and willow and cottonwood.

539
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.170
And as soon as that happened,
the birds started moving in.

540
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.820
The number of songbirds and migratory birds started to increase greatly.

541
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.360
The number of beavers start ears because beavers like to eat,

542
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:33.040
to eat the trees and beavers lightbulbs ecosystem engineers,

543
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:38.041
their create niches for other species and the dams they built in the rivers.

544
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.370
Provided habitats for autism isn't even a human talking.
It's a unicorn.

545
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:47.090
Fish and reptiles and amphibians,
fancy school,
ut,

546
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.210
and he was at all.
As a result of that,

547
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.650
the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,
which meant more hawks,

548
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.890
more weasels,
more foxes,
more badgers,

549
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.540
ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrier that the walls had left

550
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.470
bears fed in at too,
and that population began to rise as well.

551
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:10.090
Partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs

552
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.390
and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the carbs

553
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.500
of the deer.
Here's where it gets really interesting.

554
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.600
My erection,

555
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:29.070
<v 4>we should probably not play all of this video.
It's there.
It's not ours.</v>

556
00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.490
But uh,
that's a fascinating thing and you,
you,

557
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:36.140
you only hear one side of that,
you know,
you hear that the wolves are dangerous.

558
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.960
People are scared of the wolf populations growing.
And that's,

559
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.430
that's the part I usually hear.

560
00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.740
But it's fascinating to hear that all this was going on as well.

561
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.430
You know what I was thinking when we were listening to that is how much pleasure

562
00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:48.590
that guy was taking in his own accent.

563
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.490
And it's something I often notice with British people and French,

564
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.510
not so much Spanish.
And I don't notice it with,
with Americans speaking English,

565
00:31:56.511 --> 00:32:01.490
like I never like get into how my voice sounds while I'm speaking the way that

566
00:32:01.491 --> 00:32:05.180
guy obviously was right.
But he's a presenter,
you know,

567
00:32:05.181 --> 00:32:07.670
he's trying to be dramatic.
Don't you think he was trying?
Yeah,

568
00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.140
he was like the Lord of the forest or something.

569
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.940
I should do every nature documentary Fr.
I love it,
I think,

570
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.920
but he always made me more excited.
He called,

571
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.990
he kept calling it the yellow stone.

572
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.830
Well,
if you know,
but the British have,
I mean their,

573
00:32:24.831 --> 00:32:28.790
their accent is much more tied into identity and I think different parts of

574
00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:32.330
identity than American accent or American accent is regional,

575
00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.110
whereas the British accents are regional,
but also class based.

576
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.530
So that guy in speaking,
the way he's speaking is you.

577
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:44.360
He went to Eaton and then he went to Cambridge and his parents had lots of money

578
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.490
in.
His family's had lots of money for a long time.

579
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.120
A British person listens to three words and like knows where that guy's from,

580
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:53.090
where he went to school.
His whole sale it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

581
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.650
So sort of like we can wreck rep recognise accents from the south.
Yeah.
Right.

582
00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:01.130
York accent.
All we have is,
is regional and we don't even have that much,

583
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:04.850
cause we all grew up watching a lot of the same TV shows.
There's still regional.

584
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.050
I think we there is,
yeah.

585
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:10.520
But friends and if you have any friends in New York or Boston or Baltimore,

586
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.630
Baltimore's a weird one.

587
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.240
They've got a weird sort of half southern thing going on down there,

588
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.530
but there's no,
I don't think there's any,
uh,
equivalent in,

589
00:33:18.531 --> 00:33:21.950
in England too.
Like my accent.
Right.
You'll hear me talk.

590
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:24.740
You don't know where I'm from.
You don't know any of that.
My parents had money,

591
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:26.870
didn't have money where I grew up.
Nothing.
Right.

592
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.670
There's nothing like that in England.
You talk people.
No,
that's interesting.
Yeah.

593
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.120
<v 3>I like those,
you know,
there's linguists,
you can listen to your accent.</v>

594
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.340
Not everybody,
but apparently there's people who can,

595
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.780
who are trained to listen to any accent and they can tell you within like 50

596
00:33:41.781 --> 00:33:45.800
miles where you lived there.
A lot of the time they're really good at it.

597
00:33:45.801 --> 00:33:48.560
Like they can identify it.
It's,
they're trained to do that.

598
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:52.040
They're like forensics people,
you know,
like if you,
if you hear someone's voice,

599
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:53.150
it says everything about them.

600
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.290
<v 4>There's some words that are indicators to,
like,</v>

601
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.830
I lived in western Pennsylvania when I was a kid for a while and there's some

602
00:33:59.831 --> 00:34:00.320
words

603
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.650
<v 3>say like if someone is trained that way that they can pick it up.
Like,
ah,</v>

604
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.500
I hate black people.
Like,
Oh,

605
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:09.630
you can identify where someone's from when they say that guy over here.

606
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.070
No,
you can't put there.
Well,
no,
I mean there are stereotypes for that,
you know,

607
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:19.700
because there are like,
um,
there's,
you know,
there's big,

608
00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:21.830
it's everywhere but there is a stereotype,

609
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.100
there's a lot of stereotypes attached to a,

610
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.610
like a rebel flag on your truck says a lot.

611
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.211
You know,

612
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:33.050
like when you see that it says a lot because you are sort of like when you were

613
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:34.850
saying like the south will rise again.

614
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.900
You are pointing to a time when slavery was okay and

615
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.380
<v 4>so you see it.
My friend,</v>

616
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:46.280
what I see is a bunch of people that are very proud about the southern heritage.

617
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:47.510
They liked that part of the country.

618
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.240
<v 3>I was raised in the south.
I love that part of the country.
I really do.</v>

619
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.580
I would like the south to rise again minus the slavery.
Wonderful.

620
00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:00.390
Leonard Skinner.
Why?
Yeah.
Why does it have to,
why is it,

621
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.690
why does that have to be included?
What?
The slavery?
Yeah,

622
00:35:03.691 --> 00:35:06.480
why does it have to be included in the south?
Well because that flag,

623
00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:10.980
that's why everyone has a bad with that flag because that flag indicates a war

624
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:16.200
that that was partially fight over keeping slaves over there.
Right.

625
00:35:16.201 --> 00:35:17.250
To keep slaves.

626
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.510
Like you wanted to keep your slaves and these sons of bitches up north are

627
00:35:21.511 --> 00:35:25.650
telling you that you couldn't do that anymore and that's a big problem for your

628
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:27.560
economy.
And because you know,
you,

629
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:29.790
you weren't just making money from the slaves working,

630
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.600
but the slave trade itself,
you are making tons of money too.

631
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:38.100
So therefore that flag just inherently spells racism.
It doesn't have to,
it's

632
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.430
<v 1>what it does though to me.
I mean a lot of times it just does.
I mean,</v>

633
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:45.510
I'm a pretty open guy,
but if I see that flag,
I think racism.

634
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.980
<v 3>Well yeah.
It's like anytime people,
yeah,
it's,
it's a problem.
It's unavoidable.</v>

635
00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.440
It's unavoidable because that's what happens.

636
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:57.270
It's like anytime you see the swastika,
you don't think getting Nash.
Exactly.

637
00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:59.940
That's funny.
Yeah.
You think Nazis.

638
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.310
<v 1>Yeah.
If you try to have a swastika tattooed on your body today,</v>

639
00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:05.680
you're a real piece of shit.
But at one point in time,

640
00:36:05.681 --> 00:36:09.820
swastika was in eastern and what was in many different,

641
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.840
many different,
there's some native American native Americans.
Yeah,

642
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.450
that it was an old symbol.
In fact,
that old symbol,

643
00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:20.590
there's a place in somewhere in the valley like Canoga park or something like

644
00:36:20.591 --> 00:36:23.800
that.
There's this really old place that was built by,

645
00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:28.030
by people from India and there's swastikas on it and they have a big sign there

646
00:36:28.031 --> 00:36:31.990
explaining their,
look at this,
getting national,
the swastika.

647
00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.600
They had a big sign there explaining uh,

648
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:39.010
what the original meaning of that symbol means cause today that's the symbol of

649
00:36:39.011 --> 00:36:39.660
hate.

650
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.260
<v 3>Yep.
Yeah.
It just crazy.
And people are,
there is,</v>

651
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.020
I heard there's some movement called like this trying to bring back this or take

652
00:36:46.021 --> 00:36:49.050
the swat swastika out of the Nazi idea.

653
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.870
Like there's like they want to bring this symbol back somehow.

654
00:36:51.871 --> 00:36:54.600
There's people who are trying to show that you can't,

655
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.230
<v 1>Hitler fucked up that mustache and he fucked up that swastika.
Those two things.</v>

656
00:36:59.231 --> 00:37:02.210
We'll never see it again.
He really did.
He was such a con he,

657
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.920
you can't wear the same mustache as Sam.

658
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.540
About how many people with regular mustaches were just total pieces of shit and

659
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:08.950
it's to where that mustache,

660
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.730
you don't get associated with that person's behavior.
Who is

661
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.710
<v 3>comedian who had a bit about like whether there were lots of Germans named</v>

662
00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:18.950
Hitler because now you never meet anyone who's last name is Hitler.

663
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:26.090
Hitler's descendants decide,
decided not to have kids.
Like there was a decision.

664
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.310
Yeah,
something like that.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's interesting.

665
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.320
I don't mean to end the family lines actually died or do you think,

666
00:37:35.061 --> 00:37:36.890
do you believe the idea that he went to South America

667
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.500
<v 1>hear that?
That's the most recent one.</v>

668
00:37:38.501 --> 00:37:42.840
The FBI saying that Hitler went to Argentina,
the FBI saying Fbo,

669
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.230
one of those Internet things where Pete,
it's,
I don't know.
I don't,

670
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.170
I'm saying that the FBI,

671
00:37:47.171 --> 00:37:49.930
I'm saying it's one of those internet things where someone had supposedly found

672
00:37:49.931 --> 00:37:52.240
a freedom of information to article from,
you know,

673
00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.080
1947 that shows that Hitler escaped in a fucking submarine.

674
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.450
<v 3>Okay.
Do you see,
I think he might have,
it's all redacted,</v>

675
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:04.860
like half of it's redacted,
like,
look,
this is it.
The fuck out of here with this.

676
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.860
This is a piece of paper that someone put online.
That's what that is.

677
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.630
Unless I hear better,
the Hitler is not in fucking Argentina.
You asked.

678
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.110
Not Anymore.
He found his body.

679
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.010
He was kind of cute at that age.
Sorry you just had the picture of Hitler.

680
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:23.610
He looked a bit like,
you know he was sultry.
Joe.
Joe,

681
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.590
would you have spanked him?
Know what I mean?
Good God I don't want and Pam,

682
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.900
yeah that got fucked up.
Blow things.
But,
but I,
I don't know man.

683
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:35.980
I kind of believe he,
I do kind of

684
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.360
<v 7>one of those believe that.
Well just because it's Hitler.
So what?
Look,</v>

685
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.440
cause if you're a healer come the walls are falling down.
Yeah,

686
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.490
but you would get out of there man.
How's he getting deep tunnel?

687
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:47.890
There was no body.
No,
the body,

688
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:52.390
apparently the body that they found the dental records or the body itself was

689
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:56.500
not the body of a man.
It was like a woman's body.
There's like,
yeah,

690
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:59.320
look it up like this scale cause they know you look it up.

691
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.830
It's the one of the craziest
disproven.

692
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.300
They say that they incinerated his body.
All right.
They supposedly,

693
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:13.700
his body was set on fire and then that the eye,
the bar,

694
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.850
the bones don't match the bones of a male.

695
00:39:15.851 --> 00:39:18.700
And then he went to South America and lived at a really good life.

696
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.570
<v 0>I believe that one,
a lot of Nazis definitely did go to South America.</v>

697
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.740
That's a fact.
And a lot of Nazis got hired by NASA.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

698
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:30.160
Operation Paperclip,
bring him to California.
Wernher von Braun.
In fact,

699
00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.550
the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if Wernher von Braun was alive today,

700
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:37.450
he'd be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
Jesus,
stop.
And think about that.

701
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.050
The guy who was the head of NASA was a hardcore Nazi.
He,

702
00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:44.170
they hung the five slowest,
um,
workers,

703
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.350
like whether it was every day or once a week,
whatever it was,

704
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.080
they would hang them in front of their rocket factory in Berlin.

705
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.480
They would just take the five slowest workers and hang them.

706
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.190
And one of the guys who was,

707
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:58.360
there was a documentary that this guy did on the moon landings and he started

708
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:02.860
interviewing people that were in the concentration camps that knew like he had

709
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:06.160
seen Wernher von Braun walk in,
had seen all these different,

710
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:09.520
like high level Nazi scientists walk in.
There's a rocket factories,

711
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.720
Wernher von Braun's,
rocket factories used Jewish slaves and murdered them.

712
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:19.000
So I mean,
he's a fucking,
he was a monster and he was the head of NASA.
Jesus.

713
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.320
He was a real monster.
I mean,

714
00:40:21.321 --> 00:40:24.430
and people try to sugarcoat that because the fact that guy did amazing things

715
00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:27.820
with rocketry,
but you know,
and so while it wasn't his idea of,
well,

716
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.500
you got to understand that,
oh please,

717
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.120
they hung the five slowest fucking people in front of his rocket factory in

718
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:37.330
Berlin.
And then the United States took them aboard.

719
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:42.470
<v 7>That tendency to sugarcoat murder is so fucked up and it happens all the time.</v>

720
00:40:42.991 --> 00:40:46.270
And it's really an odd thing when you see,
when you rock white

721
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.580
<v 0>thing.
Yeah,
people want something to be good or evil.</v>

722
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.360
They don't want someone to be evil.
And also amazing because that's,

723
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.840
that's too fucked up.
If you're,
you're good or you're bad.
They,

724
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.460
that's why they sugarcoat and that's why they defend.
You know,
I mean,
I've,

725
00:40:59.461 --> 00:41:00.650
I've heard someone that,

726
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:05.260
there was a recent thing where someone was talking about this guy who had done a

727
00:41:05.261 --> 00:41:08.590
bunch of fucked up shit and lied about a bunch of things and his friends were

728
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:10.420
saying,
yeah,
but what about this?

729
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.730
He did this and he was saying all these positive things that he did.
I'm like,

730
00:41:13.731 --> 00:41:16.360
that doesn't matter.
He's still did those other things.
It's like,

731
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.600
it doesn't make those other things nonexistent.
If you,

732
00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:22.860
you're doing something fucked up,
you're cheating people,
you're lying.

733
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.080
Whatever you're doing here,
fucking people over,
you're doing something,

734
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.620
something evil to people.
If you're also doing something good,

735
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:32.170
it doesn't mean you didn't do the eval thing right.
They don't,

736
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.670
they don't go and vice versa.
Vice versa as well.
Right.
I mean we,
the,

737
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.490
there's some saying we judge our heroes by their finest moment and are criminals

738
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:44.750
by their worst.
Yes.
You know,
so you're a great guy.
You fuck up.
You do one thing.

739
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:48.110
You know,
whatever.
And that's how we judge you for the rest of your life.

740
00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.690
You know,
fucked up crimes and they turned out to be really good.
People.

741
00:41:53.691 --> 00:41:55.640
Like Joey Diaz is a prayer.
For example,
you know,

742
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:57.200
if you looked at Joey Diaz on paper,

743
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.400
he went to jail for armed kidnapping of a drug deal with a machine gun.

744
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.770
I mean he did some crazy fucking shit.

745
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.530
But if you know Joey Diaz as a human being,

746
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:10.250
he's one of the sweetest guys you'll ever meet in your life.
He's so friendly.

747
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:14.240
He's so funny.
I mean,
every time the phone rings and it's Joey,

748
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:15.950
I get excited to talk to him.
Yeah.

749
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.980
If you just looked at him as on that instance of his life and a cocaine fueled

750
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:24.830
rage,
kidnap some guy,
you would see,
think he's a terrible person.

751
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.950
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a strange thing,
isn't it?</v>

752
00:42:26.951 --> 00:42:30.160
When like somebody gets convicted of something that they did and then they've

753
00:42:30.161 --> 00:42:34.360
done like 20 years in prison and they're probably different.

754
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:35.670
They've probably changed,

755
00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:39.390
but they have to stay in there for their entire lives and young men.
Did you,

756
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.320
I don't know if you guys,
if we talked about this,

757
00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:45.070
but a couple of weeks ago I interviewed a guy named Bruce Lisker for my podcast

758
00:42:45.071 --> 00:42:49.300
who was in prison in California,
San Quintin for a lot of it,

759
00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:54.301
for 26 and a half years for killing his mother when he was 17 which he did not

760
00:42:55.541 --> 00:43:00.220
do.
And men,
he is amazing.
He's an amazing dude.

761
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:04.600
He's like,
he is so not bitter.
It's unbelievable.

762
00:43:04.601 --> 00:43:07.950
And I asked them the beginning of the podcast,
I was like,
dude,
when I,

763
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.990
when you know,

764
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:12.850
I thought when I met you that I would be sitting next to a ticking time bomb of

765
00:43:12.851 --> 00:43:17.200
a guy like explosive with rage,
you know,
and you're so chilled out.

766
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.610
What I feel like I'm sitting here with Mandela and he said they tried to destroy

767
00:43:21.611 --> 00:43:26.500
my life for 26 and a half years.
I'm not going to finish the job for them.
Wow.

768
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.190
He's a,
he's a great guy.
He's right near here.
Either you want to meet him.

769
00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:31.720
He's a wonderful dude,
man.

770
00:43:31.721 --> 00:43:35.920
I love that attitude because that attitude is saying fuck you to your past.

771
00:43:35.921 --> 00:43:36.940
And it's like,
you know,

772
00:43:36.941 --> 00:43:41.740
cause when you meet people who are rationalizing being an asshole from their

773
00:43:41.741 --> 00:43:43.840
past,
you know,
they,
oh,
they have this story.

774
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:47.560
They keep telling about their shitty family,
they're abusive parents,

775
00:43:47.561 --> 00:43:51.760
they're awful,
whatever it is.
And you have empathy for them.

776
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:56.740
But simultaneously you realize how they're recreating that story every time they

777
00:43:56.741 --> 00:44:00.010
bring it up.
Every time they talk about this awful thing that happened to them,

778
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.960
it's like a,
um,
in Buddhism,
it's compared to like making a necklace,

779
00:44:04.961 --> 00:44:06.220
like beating a necklace.

780
00:44:06.221 --> 00:44:10.000
And every moment you're sort of recreating yourself again and again and again.

781
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.850
And when people have experiences like that and they're like,
no,

782
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:17.410
I'm not going to let that be the anchor that pulls me down into a negative life.

783
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.820
I can reinvent myself in this very moment right now,

784
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:26.440
regardless of whatever happened to me,
regardless of my past.
That's all gone.

785
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:31.920
It's really cool.
And he said,
uh,
he said like,
really?
Who knows

786
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.850
<v 2>where I would be right now if this hadn't happened,
right?
Maybe I'd be dead.</v>

787
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:38.090
Maybe I would have had a car accident.
Maybe,
you know,

788
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.040
something else would have happened to me that there's no way to predict it.

789
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.000
So the fact that I'm here now,
it is unavoidably a good thing.
Yeah,

790
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.720
I'm here,
I'm intact.
You know,
and he's,

791
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:53.250
his experience of prison was a very moving,

792
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.720
um,
and not really what I was expecting.
Like he said the,
you know,

793
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.670
sexual abuse and that sort of thing was not an issue for him.
Uh,

794
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:05.970
and uh,
fighting like four or five times,

795
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:08.340
he had to like stand up to someone and he said he got,

796
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.490
I think if I remember correctly,
he said like,
he got his ass kicked,

797
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.150
but he had to establish that he,
there was a limit.
You couldn't push him past.

798
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:19.470
That was the main thing.
But he's a cool guy.
And,
and uh,

799
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:24.660
yeah,
the way I met him was that what happened was his father died and his father

800
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.450
never believed that he killed his mother.
And in fact,

801
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:31.020
the way he got into it was so fucked up.
He's 17.
He goes in,

802
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:36.140
the detective who was running the investigation just had a bug up his ass and

803
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:40.650
decided he did it and would not be swayed from that conclusion.
Right.
And,

804
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.620
but,
but there was like,
there was no evidence.

805
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.050
The evidence was manufactured fucked around anyway.

806
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.630
So what they told him was plead out and they said like,
you're,

807
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.670
you're 17 you say you did it,
you'll do juvie for a year or two,

808
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:55.860
then you'll do like one or two years,
you know,
in,

809
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:59.940
in a medium security and you're out.
Right.
So he took the advice,

810
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:03.120
his father encouraged him to take the advice from the lawyer.
He pleaded,

811
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.230
pleaded guilty,
went in,
and then he started getting interviewed by psychiatrists,

812
00:46:08.231 --> 00:46:09.660
prison psychiatrist.
Right.

813
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.690
And they kept reporting that he wasn't showing remorse.
Well,

814
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:16.950
of course he's not showing remorse.
He didn't do it right.
So this,

815
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.240
this charade that he was supposedly,

816
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:22.920
he could just sign the paper and go in for a few years and be out was bullshit

817
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:27.840
because he had to go through 100% and actually act as if he had done it.

818
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:30.360
And he was so remorseful and crying and Oh my God.

819
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.810
And he couldn't do that cause the guy's got some fucking integrity.
Right.

820
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.370
So that's why he was in for 26 and a half years.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

821
00:46:38.371 --> 00:46:41.700
And so his father died and he used,
he left some,
some money,

822
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:42.840
15 grand or something.

823
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:47.130
And he used that money to hire a private detective to go back and sort of re

824
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.570
figure,
look at the evidence again.
This guy did ran,
blew through the money,

825
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:52.410
but the detective,

826
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:56.430
by the time the money was gone was like convinced that this was all bullshit.

827
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.740
So he was like,
fuck it,
I'm doing it pro bono.

828
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.510
And he kept going at it and then he got a couple of guys from the La Times to

829
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:08.511
write about the case and my aunt saw the article and send 100 bucks to the like

830
00:47:09.691 --> 00:47:13.770
fun to help him and they became friends and that's how I got to know him.
Wow.

831
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.590
Incredible.
Yeah,
it's incredible.

832
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.620
So what happens when a prosecutor does something evil like that?

833
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:24.480
Is that guy criminally responsible now?
No,
the d the detective.
Well,

834
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:28.740
not the prosecutor because the prosecutor is relying on the evidence presented

835
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:32.860
by the police.
Right.
Did tactics.
So the detective was the one who set him up,

836
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:37.210
who lied about the evidence,
who then here's the,
here's the kicker.

837
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.170
As Bruce said,
the guy who got me thrown into jail got me out.

838
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:46.210
And the way he got me out was by pushing too hard because what he did was the

839
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.190
same detective throughout his career.

840
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.800
Every time Bruce Bruce's case came up for parole,

841
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:55.600
he doubled or parole or probation,
I don't know which it is.
Um,
uh,

842
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:59.990
this guy would come to the hearing and you talk about how,

843
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.380
how terrible he was,
how evil he was and blah,
blah,
blah.

844
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.710
He came to a hearing like 25 years into it and he said,

845
00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:08.020
not only is this guy definitely guilty,

846
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.240
but I have found more evidence now 25 years later because there was money

847
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:14.410
missing from the mother.

848
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:20.110
And so one of the ideas was the motive was to rob his mother of a couple of

849
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.270
hundred dollars.
And this detective said,
I went back and got it.

850
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:25.540
I got a into the house,
you know,
new owners and all that.

851
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.840
And they claimed that they had found the money in the crawl space in this kid's

852
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:34.270
former bedroom.
Right.
So,
you know,

853
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.000
now the case is even stronger than it was 25 years ago,

854
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:41.920
but denied that this detective goes back interviews,

855
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:44.380
all the people who had owned the house and they all said,

856
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.600
we never called the police.
So we never found any money.

857
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.850
I have no idea what that guy's talking about.

858
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:54.030
The detective just made that shit up.
Wow.
And that was his misstep.

859
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.650
And that's what eventually got Bruce out that it,

860
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:01.650
then the bi went and he's like interviews everyone like,
oh,
this is uh,
you know,

861
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.690
100% sure this guy manufacturer that evidence.

862
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.720
He must've done that more than one I.
Exactly,
exactly.

863
00:49:07.721 --> 00:49:12.640
And this was one of his first cases in a 25 year career.
Oh my God.

864
00:49:12.641 --> 00:49:16.600
So guy's entire crew was just setting people up and treating them like,

865
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:18.880
or nobody knows.
And you know why nobody knows?

866
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.960
Because the LAPD is not investigating.
They're not opening up his cases.

867
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:27.310
They're not going back and looking at this.
Yeah.
It's a fun thing,
man.

868
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.640
So this,
I mean,
listen to the podcast.
If anyone who's interested,
it's,

869
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:34.420
it's on my podcast,
tangentially speaking.
It's like two or three episodes back.

870
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:37.750
Bruce Lisker,
he tells the whole story,
what the fuck's fucked up?

871
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:41.830
This cop is retired with full benefits.
Oh my God.

872
00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.680
How is that possible?
That's a criminal.

873
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:48.280
They did an internal investigation for about a,

874
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:53.440
they have a year to turn in the results,
right?
This guy from internal affairs,

875
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:56.680
who's an honorable cop,
did the investigation,

876
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.570
found that this case was definitely a setup,
right?
Only looking at this one case.

877
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:05.980
Right.
Definitely a set up,
complete bullshit,
manufactured evidence,
et Cetera.

878
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.480
A couple of weeks before the year was over and the report would be officially

879
00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:14.440
filed,
his superiors took him off the case and squashed it.

880
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.630
No report was ever filed.

881
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.850
And the cop who led that investigation,
I said to him,
Bruce,
like,

882
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:24.270
have you been in touch with this guy?
Like how's his career going?

883
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:28.040
He said he's shunned by the police,
so he's still working,

884
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.840
<v 1>but he's like,
nobody's,
you know,
pals with him.
What the fuck?
Yeah,</v>

885
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:36.980
it's a,
it's a,
you know,
it's that culture.
Well,
it's that culture of,
you know,

886
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:38.870
shunning rats,
you know,

887
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.020
culture of going after the people that investigate.

888
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:46.680
But if those people didn't investigate,
look what happened in Miami during the,

889
00:50:46.681 --> 00:50:51.130
you ever see the movie cocaine cowboys documentary about Miami?
Miami,

890
00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:56.131
Miami was so crazy at one point in time that the entire police graduating squad

891
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:59.660
of,
you know,
the whatever the academy,
the police academy,
graduating class,

892
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.220
the entire group was either arrested for corruption or murdered.

893
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.620
Wow.
Is this one don Johnson was on the forest?
No,
no.
This is what I mean,

894
00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:12.670
I guess probably like it was about that era.
You know,
the,

895
00:51:12.671 --> 00:51:14.600
it was the 1980s and the,

896
00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:18.320
the stories that they tell are fucking unbelievable.

897
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.390
Cocaine cowboys and cocaine cowboys to,

898
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:22.250
or some of the best fucking documentaries ever.

899
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:26.180
Miami has more banks per capita than anywhere else in the country.

900
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.350
That's all there.
It's all cocaine money.
Right.

901
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.200
That's what built that country or that,
that part of that,
well,

902
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:36.580
you really should be a country.
You know Miami's wild.
Yeah.
It's,

903
00:51:36.581 --> 00:51:41.540
it's really like a country,
like all those Cubans,
all those pissed off Cubans.

904
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:45.410
Yeah.
Pissed off at Castro and he's right over there and 90 miles away across the

905
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:46.110
ocean.
Yeah,

906
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.360
<v 7>I did.
It's one of these things,
man,
like you know,</v>

907
00:51:48.361 --> 00:51:53.361
like when you watch cops and you realize what you're actually watching is just

908
00:51:54.541 --> 00:51:58.460
people getting arrested for something that shouldn't be illegal.
Yeah.
It's,

909
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.930
it's really hard to enjoy it anymore.
Like,
you know,

910
00:52:00.931 --> 00:52:05.460
like a victorious copies found some drugs on a person and then acts like he's

911
00:52:05.461 --> 00:52:08.730
doing some heroic thing.
It's like,
what are you doing?

912
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:12.450
You're just chaining up a skinny guy.
Wanted to feel good man.

913
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.120
You're not being a hero right now.

914
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:19.800
This is just a guy who wanted to know what it felt like to be God for a few

915
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.730
hours and you're fucking slapping cuffs on him.
He's a,

916
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.290
these people are getting arrested when you see them mostly.

917
00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:28.770
They're the least dangerous looking people on earth.

918
00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.090
And then when you add to that,

919
00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:33.390
the fact that these motherfuckers are putting fake evidence in there sometimes.

920
00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.950
Oh,
do you hear about this case where the,

921
00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:38.910
they're undercover cops in a high school pretending to be friends for a whole

922
00:52:38.911 --> 00:52:42.340
semester and then they bust some guys cause they got them weaned.
Yeah.
Yeah.

923
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.410
Well that happened with a woman.

924
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.410
<v 1>She's a beautiful woman and she said Deuce to 17 year old boy honor students.</v>

925
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.860
Honor students can get her some weed and now the kid has a felony on his record.

926
00:52:52.861 --> 00:52:55.770
Yeah.
So there's a,
you never run for office.
You can never,

927
00:52:55.771 --> 00:52:56.900
there's a lot of things you could never do.

928
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.230
<v 7>It's so predatory and terrible.
I mean it's,
it's like if there was it,</v>

929
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:02.551
there's just not,

930
00:53:02.551 --> 00:53:06.510
maybe there's not enough illegal stuff out there so they have to make stuff up

931
00:53:06.511 --> 00:53:09.570
because they're not enough bad people.
That's the problem.
No,

932
00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.570
<v 1>no,
no,
no,
no.
It's right.
It's certainly not that.
There's plenty of bad people.</v>

933
00:53:12.571 --> 00:53:15.180
They just don't want to have to find them.
You go to find bad people,

934
00:53:15.181 --> 00:53:16.740
you have to deal with dangerous situations.

935
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:20.220
If you could just coerce some 17 year old boy to sell you weed and then lock

936
00:53:20.221 --> 00:53:24.320
them in a cage and you still get that little check on your wind column,
you're,

937
00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.070
you're happy to do because it's,
it

938
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.970
<v 0>perverts what the action is,
what the,</v>

939
00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.430
the noble law enforcement officer,
the noble soldier,
that,

940
00:53:32.431 --> 00:53:34.800
those are really important aspects of any society.

941
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:38.310
They want to stay safe because we don't have perfect humans yet.
They,

942
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:42.060
we don't have a perfect race.
We don't have a perfect culture.
So when you,

943
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:46.020
what you're dealing with is just an organism that is following the rules and

944
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:50.490
they subvert and pervert these rules in order to be successful.

945
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.920
The same way people cheat on their sats,
they're the same way.

946
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.730
People take steroids and get caught in the Olympics the same way.
You know,

947
00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:59.670
all these different things that people do that they're not supposed to do,

948
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.910
but they do because they just want to win more than they want.
Anything else.

949
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.550
<v 2>Yeah.
This is a very American thing too.
Uh,
you know,</v>

950
00:54:06.551 --> 00:54:08.470
I live in Spain for 22 years,
right?

951
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.220
Spanish cops and American cops completely different.
Uh,

952
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:16.180
now there are different for,
for cultural reasons having to do with the military.

953
00:54:16.181 --> 00:54:20.110
I think first of all,
I think a lot of American cops are ex military.

954
00:54:20.111 --> 00:54:23.950
They come back there,
no jobs,
best job opportunities are in law enforcement.

955
00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.340
They're already accustomed to the sort of discipline in the uniform and the,

956
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.060
you know,
the weapons and all that kind of stuff.
So they,

957
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.970
they've got a lot of them are suffering from PTSD and they've got a very us

958
00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:37.960
versus them attitude from the military.
They've served in Afghanistan,
Iraq,

959
00:54:37.961 --> 00:54:38.590
whatever.

960
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:42.610
They come back and they've got that same attitude in la or in Petaluma or

961
00:54:42.611 --> 00:54:45.010
wherever the fuck they're working.
So that's a problem.

962
00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:47.620
The other issue is the legal system.

963
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.850
The American legal system is based as you were just pointing out on rules,
right?

964
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.430
If you break the rule,
that's illegal.

965
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.940
European legal system is a different,
uh,

966
00:54:57.941 --> 00:55:00.130
the trigger is not that you broke the rule.

967
00:55:00.131 --> 00:55:03.970
The trigger is that somebody complained that you bothered somebody.

968
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:08.830
So there are no Spanish cops flying over the city with infrared cameras on

969
00:55:08.831 --> 00:55:11.140
helicopters looking for a grow rooms.

970
00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.980
They're just not doing it because unless someone complains,

971
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.580
they don't give a shit right there.
It's the same thing with parking.

972
00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:21.460
It's like if you're blocking traffic,
they'll give you a ticket.

973
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:25.240
If you're just parking in an area where the thing says from three d six and not

974
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:29.020
from four to two or whatever it is,
they don't give a fuck.
I mean,
I,
I've,

975
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.380
I've experienced it directly with them where I'm parking on my motorcycle and

976
00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:34.000
there's this big leg lawn,

977
00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:38.110
long line of motorcycles on the Ramblas and the pedestrian area of the Ramblas

978
00:55:38.111 --> 00:55:41.770
in Barcelona.
And I go to this cop and I know you're not allowed to park there,

979
00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:45.010
but they're like 15 motorcycles and the cop standing there and I say to him,

980
00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:49.870
can I park here?
What?
And he's like,
no.
But normally we know we won't do anything.

981
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.280
It's like,
that's a cop.

982
00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:55.750
<v 0>That's a definitely a better way of doing it.
We're doing over here.</v>

983
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.813
<v 2>Yeah,
just the g.</v>

984
00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:02.090
If you're a judge and you've put someone in jail for their entire lives,

985
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.100
for a drug,
how do you sleep at night?
Well,
minimum mandatory sentencing.

986
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:11.970
The judges can't even decide.
Right.
Under the Reagan administration,

987
00:56:11.971 --> 00:56:14.100
they passed these laws saying,
well,
if you've got,
you know,

988
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:17.400
one to four ounces of marijuana,
you know,
that's five years.

989
00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:22.700
It doesn't matter who you are.
Don't be a jet.
A lot of judges and design,

990
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.980
they can't.
Yeah,
I

991
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.670
<v 3>hear what you're saying.</v>

992
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.610
A lot of judges resigned because of that because they said,

993
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:31.360
what am I doing all I'm doing?
It's a table.
I'm not making any decisions.

994
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:35.830
How about that guy in Pennsylvania that was purposely locking kids up?

995
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:38.020
Holy Shit.
Who's getting paid?

996
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:41.560
Who's getting payoffs and so he was putting kids in detention center,

997
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.080
juvenile detention centers.
When he,
they were young,

998
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.470
they were like teenagers taking them away from their mothers and getting them

999
00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:48.940
raped,
getting them beat up,

1000
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:53.620
putting them in with all these abused kids are committing suicide.
It's so crazy.

1001
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.520
That guy ruined lives and did it for money and he just got locked in a cage.

1002
00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:59.020
Every one of those kids,

1003
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.340
every one of those kids that he sentence should get as an adult the a day to

1004
00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:06.220
beat the fuck out of them.
There should be a,
like a tag,

1005
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.940
like you pull a tag with your hunting deer and uh,

1006
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.860
they all throw their money because there's thousands of kids that should get a

1007
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:12.940
beat the fuck out of this guy.

1008
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.820
And what you hope is you get a really early hunting season,

1009
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.460
at least piss on him or beat the fuck out.

1010
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.810
Don't let him beat him to death sentence to 28 years for selling kids to the

1011
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:25.270
prison system.
But so look at that.
Look at that.

1012
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:28.660
Look at that 28 fucking years to get that piece of shit.

1013
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:33.280
I would love to plant some knuckles on that guy's face if I was a kid,

1014
00:57:33.281 --> 00:57:37.330
especially that this guy put away.
I would love to beat the shit out of that guy.

1015
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.051
That's it.

1016
00:57:38.051 --> 00:57:42.370
That she should be beaten to death by every kid that he did that to fuck that

1017
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.213
guy.

1018
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.550
When you start realizing that the criminals have done the exact same thing that

1019
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.340
pedophiles do,
like pedophiles,

1020
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:55.240
they will get jobs working at schools because they want to be around kids all

1021
00:57:55.241 --> 00:57:55.661
the time.

1022
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:59.860
They're predatory and they do that in the same way criminals were really smart

1023
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:00.490
criminals.

1024
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:04.750
They recognize that the best place to be if you're a criminal is in the legal

1025
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:07.870
system working there.
That's the best place to be.

1026
00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:12.310
If you're a judge in a criminal,
you're fucking set,
man.
You're a judge.

1027
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.200
If you're a criminal and you're a senator,

1028
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.330
if you're a criminal and you're in the government,

1029
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:21.510
that's where the top creme de la creme of the criminals go to the fucking legal

1030
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:25.540
system and into the government because that's where they have the most power and

1031
00:58:25.541 --> 00:58:30.541
are the least likely to get busted and you know that dumb criminals are the ones

1032
00:58:30.731 --> 00:58:34.840
who stay on the other side of the law,
the smart criminals of one to infiltrate,

1033
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:38.800
get in there and then start exploiting people and the exact same way and then

1034
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:40.720
they don't get arrested.
They arrest.

1035
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.130
That's where it's fucked up because let's face it,
for in the laws of the land,

1036
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:50.250
it is not criminal to put a skinny guy in handcuffs,

1037
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:55.420
take away his house,
throw him in jail,
ruin his life.
That in this land,

1038
00:58:55.421 --> 00:58:58.240
it's not legal.
It's not,
it's not criminal,

1039
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:00.760
but in the law in a greater truth.

1040
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:04.150
It's a criminal act in the same way that in Nazi Germany,

1041
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:08.170
it wasn't criminal to incinerate Jews.
You could do that.
That was not,

1042
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:12.940
but you know from histories perspective,
it was an atrocity.
So in the same way,

1043
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:15.160
it's an atrocity in a very small scale.

1044
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.970
If you're destroying people's lives over nothing.

1045
00:59:18.971 --> 00:59:22.070
I know we've talked about this a million times and don't know if there's even

1046
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.060
<v 7>much you could do except shake your fist at some monolithic power that seems to</v>

1047
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:29.690
have infiltrated everything and hope for the best.
But God damn it,
man,

1048
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:33.890
aren't you a little terrified that one day you'll end up with fucking ankle

1049
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:36.470
manacles on wearing that bright safety orange.

1050
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:41.660
A thing is you get sucked through that say tannic maze of lawyers and eventually

1051
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.510
just land in a tiny little cell.
That can happen.

1052
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:48.600
<v 0>It's certainly can,
especially if you do something that threatens some,</v>

1053
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:51.570
some other powerful organization.
You know,

1054
00:59:51.571 --> 00:59:55.250
if you want to sell some sort of a drug that's not sanctioned,

1055
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:58.650
it might interfere with the selling of another drug when they fucked up is when

1056
00:59:58.651 --> 01:00:01.440
they made it legal to have private prisons.

1057
01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.380
They fucked up when they turned opening a prison to a business.
That's the,

1058
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.420
that was just a mess when they did that.
Man,

1059
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.420
not just private contractors to build a prison,

1060
01:00:12.421 --> 01:00:16.200
but private prisons themselves that don't have to give you access.

1061
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.120
They don't have to let you look around.

1062
01:00:18.121 --> 01:00:21.570
Like Louis Theroux was on the podcast from um,
you know,
from England,

1063
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.140
the BBC show,
and he was talking about private prisons not being able,

1064
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.170
you can't even get in there and let them in.
You,
we can't film in there.
Like,

1065
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.650
you know,
public prisons,
you're way better off apparently.

1066
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.270
Definitely private prisons.
You're,
you're essentially being used as a battery,

1067
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.120
you know,
human battery to generate money

1068
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.810
<v 2>and what do you call it when corporate power and governmental power fuse.</v>

1069
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.380
Satan fascism.
Yeah.
Fashion brings us right back around to where we started.
Yeah.

1070
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:53.950
Corporate corporate government interferes in is fascism that that's what it

1071
01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:57.670
fucking is.
And that's where we're going.
Yeah,
because you're right,

1072
01:00:57.671 --> 01:00:59.200
because once it's privatized,

1073
01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:02.500
then you get that shit in Pennsylvania because part of the contracts,

1074
01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:03.281
I don't know if you've seen these,

1075
01:01:03.281 --> 01:01:08.281
are the contracts guarantee an occupancy rate of 98 to 99 whatever percent.

1076
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.840
It's in the contract that the state signs when they,
so like,

1077
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:17.710
well you know,
if,
if we don't have enough people in the prison,
we pay penalties.

1078
01:01:17.711 --> 01:01:18.560
We do that Bubba.

1079
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.700
So it makes business sense to make sure that you have that occupancy rate.

1080
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:26.350
I mean once you do that,
then it's not about people anymore.

1081
01:01:26.351 --> 01:01:27.520
It's about corporate power.

1082
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:30.310
<v 0>Oh it's so dark.
That is a fucking dark.</v>

1083
01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.380
That is always the big philosophical question.

1084
01:01:32.381 --> 01:01:36.520
Like what if everyone in the world decided to no longer break the law?

1085
01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:40.810
What if,
what would they do?
What would they do if everyone drove the speed limit?

1086
01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:44.230
Just for a day.
If everyone,
Los Angeles drove the speed limit for a month,

1087
01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:48.730
like nobody ever made a single traffic violation,
what would they do if they,

1088
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:51.100
if they have a quota,
what does that quote,
uh,
based on?

1089
01:01:51.101 --> 01:01:54.550
Is it based on a zero some evolutionary point,

1090
01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.550
like there's no way we're going to ever evolve past this,

1091
01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:00.700
so we'll never stop speeding.
We'll never stop crashing into each other.

1092
01:02:00.701 --> 01:02:04.300
We never stop.
It's like banking on complete failure.

1093
01:02:04.301 --> 01:02:07.330
Banking on no growth because if there's,
if there's growth,

1094
01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:09.370
what are you going to adjust?
You're going to say,
well,

1095
01:02:09.371 --> 01:02:13.570
I guess we can't rely on speeding tickets anymore because people don't speed the

1096
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:18.550
fuck.
That's like a $50 million a month bill that the city gets.

1097
01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:20.210
They're not going to fucking change that.
Fuck

1098
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.640
<v 3>you Google cars.
What's going to happen when all the cars are self driving?</v>

1099
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:26.840
Who's going to get six o'clock it's going to be no sexiness anymore.
Well,

1100
01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:31.080
you could feel my those sexual by blocking the back seat when you're going up

1101
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:35.040
the five man,
half the thing is wrong there.
You shouldn't be in the back seat.

1102
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:37.120
Should be driving like a man first of all,

1103
01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:39.270
and she didn't hear an engine that's fucking up the environment.

1104
01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:41.730
That's half the fun.
That's the Yin and the Yang.

1105
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.460
The ones the fuck up the environment,
the most of the sexiest.

1106
01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:49.461
They smell like gas when you hit the fucking gas smell it overflow when you let

1107
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:52.260
off.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
It's still fine man.

1108
01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:56.400
It is cool though how we are like moving in the direction of being able to just

1109
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:58.620
perpetually but ourselves on autopilot.

1110
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.550
Cause you know how they have those new cyber suits that you can put on in like

1111
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.930
lift really heavy things.

1112
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.140
You know they're going to make like miniature cyber suits where you can like

1113
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:10.410
have them walk your body around,
well this is what,
you don't even have to walk.

1114
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:13.470
You know like you're,
you can put yourself on autopilot.

1115
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.640
You can like press a button on your suit and it gets you out of bed and like

1116
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:21.960
walks you into the kitchen bath.
The atrophy of the Bosh is your teeth for you.

1117
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.280
Yeah.
We have a real problem with overpopulation too.
We do in this area,

1118
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.320
meaning overpopulation in certain areas.

1119
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:32.130
There's a few spots in the country where it's just like you can't have this many

1120
01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:36.840
people shoved in together.
It's just not wise.
It's not sustainable.

1121
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:39.780
There's,
I mean,
you're,
you're keeping it up right now on red line.

1122
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.910
If it stops raining,
we're fucked.

1123
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.110
If the gas flow stops and can't run trucks that carry vegetables,
we're fucked.

1124
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.590
You,
your trucks also bringing meet the water.

1125
01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:51.930
The water has to be pumped from Colorado earthquake.
Oh yeah.

1126
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.190
How about got it all in one place.
There's so many things that could go wrong.

1127
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.700
And one of the big ones is that we're all congested into this one area.

1128
01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:02.460
It's a riddle.
It's like a giant game of musical chairs.

1129
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:05.700
Like everybody knows the music is going to stop and you're going to be fuck,

1130
01:04:05.701 --> 01:04:09.210
most likely not have a c.
But everybody's like,
fuck it.
Fuck it.

1131
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:12.550
Let's just keep going,
man.
I was talking to this guy the other night and in like,

1132
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.520
I was,
you know,
saying,
I don't know if I'm going to have kids and I,

1133
01:04:15.521 --> 01:04:19.950
I'm starting to feel happier and happier about that and he looks at me and he's

1134
01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:23.070
like,
that is a very selfish perspective.

1135
01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.600
<v 8>He's just like saying that to you,
the opposite of self about that.</v>

1136
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.463
The fuck he say,

1137
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.590
I guarantee you that guy's not even thinking that what he's doing is being a

1138
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.340
parrot
person.
I get to squawking

1139
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:44.380
Jane,
I'm moral high ground above you.
Hi Love Children.

1140
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:48.750
In fact more than I love anything in this world.
So fuck you talk on.
He wasn't

1141
01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.190
<v 3>matching it to like how by not having kids,</v>

1142
01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:55.660
you're somehow not contributing to society somehow.
And he was like really?

1143
01:04:55.661 --> 01:05:00.550
Like you really thought he knew what he was talking about.
And you know I,

1144
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:05.440
I quoted that Jack Kerouac quote where he said to have a child is the dam of

1145
01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:06.430
being the death.
Yeah.

1146
01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:13.870
<v 8>You
know,
you know what,
what,</v>

1147
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.030
<v 3>every time you have a baby,
you're giving something the death penalty.
It is</v>

1148
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.280
<v 1>gross thing that people do where they claim moral high ground because they're</v>

1149
01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:25.090
breeding.
I hated it when I was not a father and now that I'm a father,

1150
01:05:25.091 --> 01:05:28.240
I still hate it.
It's stupid,
right?
You don't have to have children.

1151
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:31.600
You just have to be cool just if you want,
if you want people to like you,

1152
01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:33.310
you don't have to have a fucking baby.
All right.

1153
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:36.970
Just be a nice person and people will like you be a nice person,

1154
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:39.040
you'll have a positive impact in the slide.
You don't,

1155
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:42.460
it doesn't like make you or break you with her.
Not you reproduce.

1156
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:46.420
It just doesn't,
right.
It can enhance your life like many experiences.

1157
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:49.450
It certainly has enhanced mine,
but you don't have to do it.

1158
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.890
I've met some amazing people that have never have kids and don't want kids and

1159
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:58.030
there's still great to be around.
I love them.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1160
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.540
But there's so many people that when they get locked into something,

1161
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:05.230
whatever it is,
it's the way to go.
If you're not going that way,

1162
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.260
you're a fucking selfish Daqing and you don't even want to take care of her

1163
01:06:10.471 --> 01:06:13.570
baby.
I you have a little dog,
don't ya?

1164
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:17.530
And I don't want to take care of that fucking baby getting,

1165
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:18.530
I love my little facts.

1166
01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:19.911
<v 2>Say Man,</v>

1167
01:06:19.911 --> 01:06:23.510
when they invent a baby that knows to shit in this little sandbox from birth,

1168
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.260
I'll,
I'll get a baby.
And if they're furry and cute.
Other than that.
I mean,

1169
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:32.420
the only reasons I'm ever slightly regretful about the fact that I will never

1170
01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:37.160
have kids are selfish reasons.
They only see,
I'm not thinking for the kid.

1171
01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:40.280
I'm thinking like,
wow,
I'll never have that experience of this on.

1172
01:06:40.281 --> 01:06:42.650
Ever have that experience of that.
I'll never,
you know,

1173
01:06:42.651 --> 01:06:46.580
my little girl lying on my back while we read are like,

1174
01:06:46.581 --> 01:06:50.060
I'll never have those experiences.
But that's all about me.
You know,

1175
01:06:50.061 --> 01:06:54.020
as far as there's neutral,
you bring a kid in,
you don't bring a kid in,
whatever,

1176
01:06:54.021 --> 01:06:57.620
that's a wash.
Right?
Um,
and obviously for the planet,

1177
01:06:57.621 --> 01:07:01.490
it's a hugely destructive thing to have a child,
especially in American.

1178
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.240
<v 1>I don't buy that.
This is what,</v>

1179
01:07:03.241 --> 01:07:07.890
I don't buy that because every one that I know that's awesome is a person.

1180
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.150
The idea that a hugely destructive thing is bringing a person into his life.

1181
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:15.480
You're going to bring.
If you create a good person,

1182
01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:19.130
what you're going to do is you're going to bring into this world someone who's

1183
01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:23.630
going to interact with countless people in their life and most likely have a

1184
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.360
good personality and shed a good example of what a human being can be.

1185
01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.220
That's the potential of having a person,

1186
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.090
but they're still going to use a resource.

1187
01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:33.690
What are we going to do with what happened to the world?

1188
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.360
How about we all kill ourselves?
I don't have to worry about the world.

1189
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:38.330
How about we like kill ourselves for the world?

1190
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.340
Poor world is choking on our bullshit and sewage.
Let's kill ourselves.

1191
01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.440
Charles population here.
Oh No,
no.
Don't get me wrong.

1192
01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:50.040
I'm not playing both sides of the fence.
We're here.
This is what I'm saying.

1193
01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:54.930
I'm saying we're here.
We should just enjoy the fact that we're here aren't here.

1194
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.840
Don't worry about bringing kids into the world.

1195
01:07:56.841 --> 01:07:59.160
I we're going to bring kids into the world.
We're going to keep breeding.

1196
01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:01.380
What we should do is try to figure out how to be sustainable.

1197
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:04.260
Obviously we're not going to keep reading.
You say you won't,

1198
01:08:04.261 --> 01:08:06.870
but one day a record,
I'm sure it load to

1199
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:09.753
load.

1200
01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:14.250
The guy who was the president who's children are still alive today had kids when

1201
01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:15.730
he was like 60 something

1202
01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.890
<v 7>and I've got one ball,
a mama's 40 I've taken acid almost my entire life.</v>

1203
01:08:19.891 --> 01:08:23.270
My sperm look like to men cancer.

1204
01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.360
<v 1>You're one ball survived cancer.
The other ball gave up.
Tapped out.</v>

1205
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.140
<v 7>Exactly.
Super survivor</v>

1206
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.380
can easily gotten cancer at both.
By the way,
I'm not saying I'll never,

1207
01:08:35.381 --> 01:08:39.070
I mean I don't know if I'll have kids.
I'm not saying don't have kids or I just,

1208
01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:44.230
I just find it interesting how people really do think you should have a kid.

1209
01:08:44.231 --> 01:08:45.670
You know?
I think you're right,
man.

1210
01:08:45.671 --> 01:08:49.780
The idea is if you feel like having a child have a child,
what's that saying?

1211
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.530
Only have a kid.
If you can't live without a kid,
you know,

1212
01:08:53.531 --> 01:08:57.190
like if you just have to have a child to have a child and then razor,
you know,

1213
01:08:57.191 --> 01:08:59.860
somebody had gone d somebody spit it out,

1214
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:03.620
<v 1>but it's true or not.
It's even Brian is fine.</v>

1215
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.710
What life is about us interacting with each other,

1216
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.690
not just interacting with babies,

1217
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.170
not just interacting with people that are genetically related to you interacting

1218
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.380
with all of us,
and if you can contribute in any way.

1219
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.040
There's a lot of people that are great pants that contribute to this world by

1220
01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:22.430
being a great pant,
by raising someone's going to influence other people.

1221
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:25.050
And a lot of them don't necessarily get too much credit for that,
right?

1222
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:29.000
But I think it's like you get credit for making a great painting and being a

1223
01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:32.150
fucking complete schizophrenia outside of that,
and everybody's like,
oh,

1224
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:33.050
he's a brilliant genius.

1225
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.680
But you don't get credit for raising a human being and developing the

1226
01:09:36.681 --> 01:09:40.610
personality of a human being or assisting in the development of a person's

1227
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:43.790
perceptions and views of the world.
That's an incredible resource.

1228
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:47.330
And the idea that every one of them is just fucking up the world.

1229
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:50.720
Whatever the world's fucked period.
It's we're,
we're,

1230
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:53.510
we're 2014 all right.
The,
the,

1231
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:58.220
the direction that we're going at is fucked.
It's all fucked.
Was too many of us.

1232
01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.810
There's too much pollution.
It's not changing.
There's no,
there's the,

1233
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.980
the global warming is happening,
whether you like it or not,

1234
01:10:03.981 --> 01:10:06.940
whether you blame it on democratic Vaginas,
sponsors,
whatever,
the,

1235
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:11.330
whatever you do,
it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Live.
Just live,
be alive.

1236
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:14.570
The justifications of having a baby or not having a baby,

1237
01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:18.380
all of them are bullshit.
They're all bullshit.
Just be nice.
Just do it.

1238
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.120
Live your life and be nice.

1239
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:24.360
<v 7>Yeah.
What do you,
you don't,
you don't buy it.
Hi,
Joe Rogan is Nelson Mandela.</v>

1240
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.150
Wait,
most people don't know where.

1241
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:33.650
<v 2>Oh No,
wait it before the show.
Yeah,
I saw a thing the other night.
I was watching,</v>

1242
01:10:33.651 --> 01:10:36.030
uh,
uh,
sorry to interrupt you Duncan.

1243
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.040
<v 7>I wasn't interrupting.
How is asking you a question?</v>

1244
01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:42.120
Are you asking me if I buy what you don't buy his it,
that you are one.

1245
01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.110
You're a person.

1246
01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.010
I'm guessing here use opinion as don't you should as an environmentalist,

1247
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:51.030
not have kids.
Well,
I mean,
look,
I,
my whole world view

1248
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.840
<v 2>is,
is layered,
right?
It's,</v>

1249
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:56.680
it's like there's an optimist inside of pessimists surrounded by an optimist.

1250
01:10:56.681 --> 01:10:58.240
It's like atmospheric layers.

1251
01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:01.690
So essentially I agree with Joe that who gives a shit.
It's fucked.

1252
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.050
That's the optimism,
right?
But within that,

1253
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.100
I don't know if that sounds like that's what it is because it's like,
well,

1254
01:11:09.101 --> 01:11:11.140
if it's fuck that and I don't need to worry.
All right,

1255
01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:14.040
so I can be optimistic and happy.
All,
all right.
But within that,
there

1256
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.380
<v 4>is the sense that,
okay,
look,
we are uh,
uh,</v>

1257
01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:21.750
a garage on the planet where it's sucking up the resources,

1258
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.060
spewing out toxins,
destroying everything.

1259
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.060
And some of us do that at a higher rate than others.

1260
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:31.710
Americans at a higher rate than anyone,
right?
We create more carbon,
more plastic,

1261
01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:33.210
more everything,
and use more energy.

1262
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.600
So having an American baby from an environmental point of view is not a good

1263
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:43.320
thing for the trajectory of the planet.
Now,
within Joe's context,

1264
01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:47.010
it's all fucked anyway.
The trajectory is going over a cliff.
So have a good time.

1265
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.560
No.
The only thing I agree on both levels.

1266
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:52.320
The only thing that's going to help that it's human innovations at this point in

1267
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:53.101
time,
the,
the,

1268
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:57.000
the momentum of creating things is so out of control that the only thing that's

1269
01:11:57.001 --> 01:12:00.000
going to be able to put a halt to it is a human being that's really smart.

1270
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.100
That figures out how to do it sustainably.
A human being.
Yeah.

1271
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:07.770
Figures out what one or a series or a group or a movement that figures out how

1272
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:11.220
to engineer society the same way we've engineered many other aspects of our

1273
01:12:11.221 --> 01:12:15.990
society or our world that make us able to walk down a street and not worry about

1274
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:18.540
getting eaten by a lion.
So engineer should have baby.

1275
01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.480
<v 7>Awesome.
I don't know how helpful it is to think of,
I mean,
I know what you mean.</v>

1276
01:12:22.481 --> 01:12:26.140
We're fucked and all that language,
but,
but we're not,
I don't,
that's,

1277
01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.270
I don't think we are and I think we're like thinking,

1278
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.230
getting in that trap of thinking of our species is a,

1279
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:35.980
as a plague on the planet.
If you think of this species is a plague,

1280
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:41.110
then you're basically saying,
well,
I too,
I'm a plague.
Right then I am the cancer.

1281
01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:45.310
I'm walking,
I'm old Irving parasite.
And if you think you're living parasite,

1282
01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:48.040
then that means you're going to start acting like a parasite because why

1283
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:50.680
wouldn't you?
You're a parasite.
So I think it's,

1284
01:12:50.681 --> 01:12:53.860
the language is weird because you're saying nature is malfunctioning.

1285
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.190
Right now you're saying this planet is a malfunctioning planet.

1286
01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.680
Nature's gone wrong.
Look at terrible nature.

1287
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.950
It made all these little humans and they're ruining the earth.
But it's like,

1288
01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.900
how dare you say nature is fucking up.
It's nature.
You're a piece of it.

1289
01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.940
You know it's,
you're a tiny little pea.

1290
01:13:09.941 --> 01:13:14.200
It's like a little droplet of water in a river being like,
this is an evil river.

1291
01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.330
It's tearing up

1292
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:20.330
<v 4>the shore.
Okay,
so by that logic,
how dare you,
you know,</v>

1293
01:13:20.331 --> 01:13:23.720
get chemotherapy for cancer.
You know,
it's part of the whole,

1294
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:27.350
it's your organism having,
you know,
it's mutations that just happen.

1295
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.370
I think the mutations of cancer are similar to the mutation that's happened to

1296
01:13:31.371 --> 01:13:32.204
our species,

1297
01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:37.420
where it's a of a thing that grows out of control and threatens to destroy the

1298
01:13:38.151 --> 01:13:38.730
host.

1299
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:40.980
<v 7>Well,
first of all,
let me just say when I said,
how dare you,</v>

1300
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:45.480
I don't really mean how,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm just following them.
And number two,
um,

1301
01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.630
the,
as far as like getting chemotherapy,
which I didn't get,

1302
01:13:48.631 --> 01:13:51.300
but if you do have cancer and you get chemotherapy,
uh,

1303
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:54.240
what you're doing is healing yourself.
You know?
So that's why you do it.

1304
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:57.800
You get chemotherapy or interfering with the flow of nature.
Well,
I,

1305
01:13:57.801 --> 01:14:00.390
I think the flow of nature is healing.

1306
01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:03.210
Like that's nature's regenerative and heels are a part of it.

1307
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:04.240
You get to decide what part.

1308
01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.230
<v 4>So then I believe that by reducing human population to,
uh,
the very,</v>

1309
01:14:09.231 --> 01:14:12.370
very small level where it's not impacting planet,
that's

1310
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.740
<v 0>the natural healing process of the planet.
No,
it's nature.</v>

1311
01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:20.020
It's your nature to think that just like it's a nature of someone who is afraid

1312
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:20.590
to die,

1313
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:24.880
to figure out a way to survive the nature of a person who's worried about their

1314
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:29.080
finite existence.
Creating a mortality is also natural.
All of its natural.

1315
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:33.670
The human curiosity itself is natural,
human innovation,
human imagination,

1316
01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:34.720
all those things are natural.

1317
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.100
So like we just live in a much more complex world that we've created because

1318
01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:42.400
we've created all these other variables within our nature that we don't like to

1319
01:14:42.401 --> 01:14:46.340
think of as natural,
but really natural plastic.
It's fucking natural.
Okay.
Yeah.

1320
01:14:46.341 --> 01:14:48.370
It comes out of people.
They'd pull it out of the ground.

1321
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:50.940
We make it into fucking portal when you know,

1322
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.420
zap it out of the multiverse and printed up the three d printer.
No,

1323
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:58.150
we're fucking taking things out of the earth and we make it.

1324
01:14:58.150 --> 01:14:58.841
Everything's natural.

1325
01:14:58.841 --> 01:15:02.630
Every fucking component of the universe that we can measure is in fact black

1326
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:07.070
holes or natural natural's a shit word because everything's fucking unnatural.

1327
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.850
It's done.
It's a redundant word.
Every time you use it,
the world's natural.

1328
01:15:10.851 --> 01:15:11.684
You can plastic.

1329
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:16.700
I think unnatural is a shit word I man made is what you should call handmade man

1330
01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:19.720
man created.
And that's also by the way nature,

1331
01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:22.570
just like a fucking beehives nature.
I just don't want to own nature.

1332
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:26.500
I don't want to shuffle around feeling like I'm a Goddamn crab,

1333
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:29.920
lice chewing through the planner.
You know you are,

1334
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.750
but you're not to me.
You're not to each other.
We're not to each other.

1335
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:35.470
But you know,

1336
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:38.470
I mean how many people do you know that claim to be conscious and then they

1337
01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:40.490
throw a cigarette out the window and you watch them do it.
You know?

1338
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.420
Now I noticed that because I've no,
cause I've seen you,

1339
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.750
if you want Joe to attack you throw a cigarette down in front of him because I

1340
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.610
every time it's like a,
the woods man,
that guy that did it in the woods,

1341
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:56.800
Sasquatch hunter.
No,
that is true.
When you see somebody who's like,

1342
01:15:56.801 --> 01:16:00.070
when you watch them throw the cigarette down and it is an odd moment where

1343
01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:01.330
you're like,
Whoa,
what is that?

1344
01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:05.650
I never noticed it before because I never really just thought about it is that

1345
01:16:05.651 --> 01:16:09.880
guy,
we were in Utah for the Scifi show and this guy we drove,

1346
01:16:09.881 --> 01:16:12.550
we flew in,
we had a great time together.
We flew in,

1347
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:15.880
we drove through Utah and the summer was so beautiful,

1348
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:20.410
unbelievably green and lush.
Lee You tie is fucking beautiful.

1349
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.700
Northern Utah.
Wow.
Whatever we,
yeah,
it was about two hours drive and uh,

1350
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:27.940
we get all the way there and the guy within five may smoking cigarettes.

1351
01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.490
He smells like gin and he,

1352
01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:34.620
this is Jenny smelled like you think I always saw and he's telling us about how

1353
01:16:34.751 --> 01:16:36.930
he met big foot the first time we went and looked in,

1354
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:41.170
he found a bulletproof wolf that appeared out of the mist.
And I'm like,
Oh shit.

1355
01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.550
So then I,
the guy,
he's,
he doesn't have a cigarette on him anymore.

1356
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.610
We're in the fucking woods,
man.
You know?
And I'm like,
where's your sugar at Man?

1357
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.360
And he threw it on the ground.
He just stepped down on the ground and I was like,

1358
01:16:52.361 --> 01:16:56.440
come on man.
The fuck you.
Was it a filter or filtered filter?

1359
01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:00.400
Filters don't biodegrade.
Well,
even the unfiltered,
come on man,

1360
01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:03.880
I don't want unfiltered in in it like two days it'll be gone.
It's paper.

1361
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:07.510
You know,
I don't want to see it.
It's garbage.
If it stays for a week,

1362
01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:10.220
it's annoying for a week.
It's annoying for zero

1363
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.340
<v 4>amount of time.
If you take it and you put in your pocket,
it's a creep move.</v>

1364
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:14.900
It's a creepy selfish move.

1365
01:17:14.901 --> 01:17:17.360
The one people throw them out the window of their car when they're driving on

1366
01:17:17.361 --> 01:17:17.981
the highway.
All right.

1367
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:21.260
That's a creepy selfish person because if you had any awareness at all,

1368
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:23.870
the last thing you do is throw a fucking cigarette out the window.

1369
01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:24.920
Especially in California.

1370
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:28.850
Well that's responsible for what percentage of the fires that happened out here.

1371
01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:31.450
I mean,
a lot of them are from people throwing cigarettes.

1372
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.420
Even read Edward Abbey Know Desert Solitaire.
He was a famous,

1373
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.160
probably the most famous author who lived in Utah.
He lived down in the south,
uh,

1374
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:43.340
east around Moab,
which is all Red Rock and arches.

1375
01:17:43.341 --> 01:17:46.310
And it's fucking beautiful.
Completely different from where you guys were.

1376
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:49.360
But if you ever go back,
go down there,
it's like amazing.

1377
01:17:49.361 --> 01:17:52.190
And that's where those dudes like swing through the arches and stuff.

1378
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:55.730
Doing all the clients where that asshole Boyscout guy got arrested for pushing

1379
01:17:55.731 --> 01:18:00.610
over one of those rocks.
Oh yeah,
exactly.
That's,
yeah.
Yeah,
it is.
It's,

1380
01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:04.730
it's filming.
Good idea.
It had been there for millions of years.
Anyway.

1381
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:08.610
Edward Abbey's is funny,
like cantankerous,
kind of like,
uh,
uh,

1382
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.080
who are we talking about earlier?
The Gonzo,
a hunter,
s Thompson,

1383
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:16.490
kind of that kind of character.
Right.
And he wrote this book where he was,

1384
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:19.910
I'm cruising down the highway,
throwing cans of beer out the window.

1385
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.740
Like he'd finish the beer and throw it out the window.

1386
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:26.150
And he was very popular among environmentalist.
In fact,
earth first,

1387
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:29.870
that movement started based on one of his books called the monkey wrench gang.

1388
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:33.950
But anyway,
Edward Abbey was like,
fuck it.
The beer cans,
not the litter,

1389
01:18:33.951 --> 01:18:37.580
the highways,
the litter don't build the fucking roads.
Right.

1390
01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:39.820
The garbage is already here.
So I mean,
he,

1391
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:43.440
it's interesting kind of twist justification.
If I ever heard one.

1392
01:18:43.441 --> 01:18:47.150
What a Douche bag.
Throwing cans out the window saying the road should be there.

1393
01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.940
Fuck you.
Read his book,
read his book,

1394
01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.450
Kim Cans flying out the window.

1395
01:18:56.451 --> 01:19:00.920
That guy's a douche bag without having read a word of it.
I might add.

1396
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.820
I told you the one thing that would get under your skin,

1397
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.780
you guys know about Earth first though,
right?

1398
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:11.840
What we're doing is basically highlighting what we talked about earlier is that

1399
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:16.960
someone can be a con also be like really awesome at something and that's what it

1400
01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:22.230
is.
You're,
you're defending him,
but you can't defend him.
He's a cunt.
No Song.

1401
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:27.620
And you know why you're wrong because we don't even know they set you up.

1402
01:19:27.621 --> 01:19:31.150
We don't even know that he actually did it.
This is a book.
Okay?

1403
01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:35.090
So he wrote a book where he may have just said he did it as a way to make a

1404
01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:36.440
point.
He did it.

1405
01:19:36.441 --> 01:19:39.530
Now he's giving permission to all these other people to throw tin cans out the

1406
01:19:39.531 --> 01:19:40.940
road and the next thing you know,
we've got to,

1407
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.600
it's raining tin cans out of every assholes.
Fuck.

1408
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:48.100
It's actually more and that ruined it for the rest of us.

1409
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.770
More of a cunt move to pretend that you did it and not really have done it.

1410
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.820
Thereby greenlighting actually thrilling cans out.

1411
01:19:55.821 --> 01:20:00.230
I'm an environmentalist and you're like really good.
He was awesome.

1412
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:04.850
Here's a guy that's what?
12 miles per gallon in your muscle car.
Wait a minute.

1413
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.990
No,
my car,
my car is a six cylinder.
But also agree

1414
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.180
<v 7>is not Clinton never claimed to be an environmentalist.
That's the diff.</v>

1415
01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:16.220
<v 1>Why?
Why are you claiming that you understand how muscle cars work?</v>

1416
01:20:16.221 --> 01:20:19.130
I don't have them.
I'm a nine 11 a very light car.

1417
01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.070
Cause you were saying earlier like you have the muscle cars and it's the,

1418
01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.730
you got to hear the,
you know the burn in the fuel that will drop one of those.

1419
01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.580
You don't drive one?
No.
So you're just like,
like Edward Abbey,

1420
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:31.750
you just thrown out this bullshit.
Give him permission.

1421
01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:34.970
The muscle car kind of muscle car.
I have a different kind,

1422
01:20:34.971 --> 01:20:37.520
but the kind that I have is not like that.
It doesn't,
it doesn't eat up a lot.

1423
01:20:37.521 --> 01:20:37.620
Yeah,

1424
01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.580
<v 7>yeah.
No,
this is my,</v>

1425
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:43.120
and here's where I take issue with Edward Abbey saying that the god Damn Street

1426
01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:47.110
is wrong.
It's already trashed.
Edward Abbey.

1427
01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:51.320
I like driving on concrete.
It's,
yeah,
it's fun.
I liked the,

1428
01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:56.500
I liked the roads,
the roads,
it,
he's on it.
He's using it.
Yeah.
I just think that,

1429
01:20:56.501 --> 01:21:00.190
that the moment you start saying like,
no,
this thing itself is the corruption.

1430
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:04.330
You're the corruption.
Abby.
How about that?
Like,
just deal with your own self.

1431
01:21:04.331 --> 01:21:05.860
I think that's what it comes down to.

1432
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:09.870
Deal with the fucking pollution inside of you.
You know,
that's gotta be it.

1433
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.630
But deal with the,

1434
01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:15.630
with what's going on in the tiny little a grudge of nature that you are right.

1435
01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:16.961
That's it.

1436
01:21:16.961 --> 01:21:20.920
First start in there and then like before you're looking at roads and deciding

1437
01:21:20.921 --> 01:21:23.980
that roads are evil or whatever.
First starting there,
I'm talking to myself.

1438
01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:28.390
I'd point might be the,
I wag my finger just about everything and call it evil.

1439
01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.950
So I'm,
I'm a hypocrite in that.

1440
01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:34.951
But I do think that the more you can pull your tentacles out of the world with

1441
01:21:36.161 --> 01:21:39.010
all your tentacles pointing,
this is bad and that's bad and that's bad,

1442
01:21:39.011 --> 01:21:42.340
and bring it back in to you and see if you can find peace in there,

1443
01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:46.000
find tranquility in there.
If you can find equilibrium and yourself,

1444
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.510
you're probably going to stop doing a lot of the things that are causing

1445
01:21:49.511 --> 01:21:52.030
pollution in the world.
I bet.
Maybe not,

1446
01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.410
but I would bet that if you could find a way to like may find stability and

1447
01:21:56.411 --> 01:22:00.660
peace,
you can treat people better.
You're not going to be so inclined to,

1448
01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.220
to do selfish things when you're happy,
you oftentimes become less selfish.

1449
01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:10.060
Don't believe me.
Chomp on some fucking ecstasy.

1450
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:15.270
Eat some really good MDM a and then see how you start acting and you're seeing

1451
01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:18.700
the way you act when you're really in a bliss state.

1452
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.690
And generally what do you do when you're on ecstasy?
How often do you hear,
yeah,

1453
01:22:22.691 --> 01:22:25.660
man,
I got on ecstasy and then gotten a fucking bar fight.

1454
01:22:25.661 --> 01:22:28.630
I just felt like beating the shit out of that guy as being a real dick.

1455
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:31.510
It's like when you wake up from getting high on ecstasy,

1456
01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:35.260
your regrets always involve being too effusive with your friends.

1457
01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.260
Like I'll come to you after an exit teacher and be like,
Oh God.

1458
01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.380
I fucking told him I loved him.
I told him,

1459
01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:45.460
I told him how important he was in my life and I'd never want,

1460
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:48.490
I'm going to miss him and you know what I mean?
Those are your regrets.

1461
01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.390
When you wake up after booze,
you're like,
oh,
holy shit.

1462
01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:55.840
I told that guy looks like he's in game of Thrones and I told that.

1463
01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.900
You know what I'm saying?
It's like in the eye,
it's internal environmental ism.

1464
01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:01.420
I

1465
01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:06.070
<v 1>don't think there's any way to justify littering like that and justifying
leering</v>

1466
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.280
<v 0>like that because there's something already bad there.
It's a silly proposition.</v>

1467
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.750
I think that if you sat down and talked to the guy,
he'd probably agree.
I mean,

1468
01:23:13.751 --> 01:23:14.650
unless he's an asshole,

1469
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:17.770
it's you think you could ever justify throwing cans out the window.

1470
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:19.870
Could you ever justify throwing cans out?

1471
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.200
You wouldn't go to his house and shit on his carpet.

1472
01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:26.080
It's not a justifiable action.
You're ruining things for everybody else.

1473
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:29.080
And if everybody did it,
the whole thing would be ruined.
Like go,

1474
01:23:29.081 --> 01:23:31.690
you drive through like the,
the boulder,

1475
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:34.390
like you've ever really drive from boulder up into the mountains.

1476
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:37.450
You don't see any garbage man.
It's amazing.
It's beautiful.

1477
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:40.060
Cars drive through there everyday.
Nobody throws shit out the window.

1478
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:42.940
They have a great respect for what that place looks like.

1479
01:23:42.941 --> 01:23:44.740
It's very rare that you see any garbage on the ground.

1480
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:48.070
But what if everybody was like that guy and just through cans out the window,

1481
01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.920
you know?
Oh this shouldn't be here.
Well yeah,
yes it should.

1482
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:52.540
It should cause that's how you use cars,
dummy.

1483
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:55.360
And otherwise it takes a long time to get anything done.
All right,

1484
01:23:55.361 --> 01:23:59.140
so either we all don't use cars and we all walk around a city or you shut the

1485
01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:02.440
fuck up and stop throwing cans out the window.
Asshole.
That's stupid.

1486
01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:03.311
What are you?

1487
01:24:03.311 --> 01:24:05.940
You're in a car and you're throwing cans out the car because of the roads that

1488
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:07.350
get the fuck out of here with this

1489
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:12.400
<v 4>smack that guy.
Take his keys and form into the world.
All Right,</v>

1490
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:14.480
get your keys stupid.
Don't let,

1491
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.860
let this listeners don't let this discourage you from reading desert solitaire

1492
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:23.750
and they still defending him because of his driving a volunteer.

1493
01:24:23.751 --> 01:24:27.610
That's the name of the game he plays when he drives his car and throws his
hands.

1494
01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:33.320
Fucking desert animals.
Yeah,
we shouldn't do that.
We shouldn't do that.

1495
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:37.520
You know,
as as often happens,
I'm curse by seeing both points of view.

1496
01:24:37.521 --> 01:24:40.400
I think you have to be think he's making the larger point.

1497
01:24:40.401 --> 01:24:43.490
That civilization itself is the toxin.

1498
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:47.630
And I so stupid.
If it wasn't a civilization to get eaten by wolves,

1499
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:53.510
sock of fat Dick,
if it wasn't a civilization,
what about you man?

1500
01:24:53.511 --> 01:24:56.060
You know hunter gatherer.
If you didn't have a civilization,

1501
01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.370
completely empty argument,

1502
01:24:58.371 --> 01:25:02.540
which goes back to the idea that if you know you're born into a world,

1503
01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:05.540
into a time and place,
I'm not kidding.
What am I going to do?
So,
Hey,
mom and dad,

1504
01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:08.720
sorry,
I'm going to go be a hunter gatherer.
You know,
I mean,
what the fuck?

1505
01:25:08.721 --> 01:25:11.150
I'm not going to use my phone.
I'm not going to try.

1506
01:25:11.151 --> 01:25:16.151
The car completely invalidates any conversation because no one can ever

1507
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:21.200
criticize civilization at all because we all participate in it.

1508
01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:25.570
So that doesn't make sense.
No,
that's not saying that no one can criticize it.

1509
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:30.050
Well,
you're saying I should be a hunter.
He civilization isn't all evil.

1510
01:25:30.051 --> 01:25:34.670
It is what it is.
Okay.
It is what it is.
Growth.
No design.

1511
01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.310
Like a growth or a movement.
It's a fungal growth is,

1512
01:25:38.311 --> 01:25:41.000
but it does not necessarily all bad,
but wait a minute,

1513
01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.860
but you're moving to a different conversation,
which is,
is it all good?

1514
01:25:45.861 --> 01:25:49.970
Is it all bad?
Of course not.
But what I'm,
what I'm objecting to is the idea,

1515
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:52.280
cause I'm going to be dealing with this a lot in this book,

1516
01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.330
that the idea that you can't criticize civilization if you participate in it,

1517
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:58.370
that's no one's come up.
It's

1518
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:59.450
<v 0>not,
that's not the argument.</v>

1519
01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:03.260
The argument isn't that you can't criticize civilization.
It says civilization,

1520
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:07.730
like almost everything is incredibly nuanced.
There's a lot of parts to it.
Yeah.

1521
01:26:07.770 --> 01:26:11.210
Some of the parts,
I feel like most of the parts are fucking amazing.

1522
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:14.750
Most of the parts of not having to worry about most of the diseases that used to

1523
01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:17.840
wipe out the population,
not having to worry about gathering your food,

1524
01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:19.100
not having to worry about sewage,

1525
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.830
not having to worry about information and education,

1526
01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:23.540
not having to worry about social structures,

1527
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.220
not have to worry about being fucking invaded by rival Mongol herds and shit.

1528
01:26:28.690 --> 01:26:31.190
The amazing aspects of civilization,
in my opinion,

1529
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:35.030
far outweigh the cancerous element of the very human beings.
Right,

1530
01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:36.430
<v 2>exactly.
And now let me see.</v>

1531
01:26:36.450 --> 01:26:39.730
Flip the whole thing back on you and say the reason you feel that way is that

1532
01:26:39.731 --> 01:26:43.450
you were raised in civilization.
So just like the Navajo call themselves,

1533
01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.690
the people and the Apache called themselves,
the people and the Iroquois.

1534
01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.160
Everybody believes that the time and place they live in is the place to be.

1535
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:56.550
And so a lot of your information about comparing civilization to proof civilized

1536
01:26:56.741 --> 01:27:01.741
times is mutated and distorted by the fact that you were from this time and

1537
01:27:01.991 --> 01:27:06.190
place,
right?
You've got a vested interest in believing that,
for example,
you said,

1538
01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.770
oh,
I wouldn't want to have to worry about dying from all these diseases.

1539
01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:13.750
Everyone died from fact is all that like the top five killers of human beings,

1540
01:27:13.751 --> 01:27:17.320
all those diseases jumped over to humans from domesticated animals.

1541
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:22.470
So they didn't exist in any important sense before civilization.

1542
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.650
Oh,
there's no doubt that tuberculosis,
no influence

1543
01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:29.160
<v 0>parks.
Sure.
Well,</v>

1544
01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:32.200
we're there and there's no doubt that everyone and every point in time

1545
01:27:32.201 --> 01:27:34.910
throughout history was in the,
the,

1546
01:27:34.911 --> 01:27:38.740
the time that they were in and the best time for,
for human beings,

1547
01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:42.130
according to them,
we justify that.
We always justify that at work.

1548
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:45.580
Or we look back in the past with nostalgia and that's what I think you do a

1549
01:27:45.581 --> 01:27:48.310
little bit.
Sure.
You know,
and I do as well.
I mean,
I think,

1550
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:51.700
I'm not saying that civilization is the only way to live life.

1551
01:27:51.701 --> 01:27:56.620
And if we were living back in the tribal days of 6,000 plus years ago and the

1552
01:27:56.621 --> 01:27:58.120
Amazon or whatever the fuck it was,

1553
01:27:58.121 --> 01:28:01.390
and people were living without any possibility of anything being any different,

1554
01:28:01.391 --> 01:28:04.720
the difference between us now and then is the incredible possibilities of

1555
01:28:04.721 --> 01:28:05.740
civilization provides.

1556
01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:09.520
I personally find those things enriching and fascinating and I would way rather

1557
01:28:09.521 --> 01:28:13.780
hang out with people of today then some asshole from 6,000 years ago that

1558
01:28:13.781 --> 01:28:14.740
doesn't have the Internet.

1559
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:17.520
<v 7>But Jay being honest,</v>

1560
01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:22.740
walking around,
do you understand how to talk the comedian?
I want to,

1561
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:25.590
I don't always say what we mean.
I want to look fuckers.

1562
01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:30.210
I want to add something here.
When I'm walking around a group of people,

1563
01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.030
I've noticed that my,
the way that I,

1564
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.780
that I'm categorizing that experience shapes the experience itself.
Absolutely.

1565
01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.430
So if I'm walking through a group of people and I'm thinking,

1566
01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.370
here I am among the Lucas,

1567
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:50.250
look at them to Bauer in your,
yeah,
if I think like that,

1568
01:28:50.251 --> 01:28:52.890
then suddenly I am living in a,
in a,
in a,

1569
01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:57.900
I'm just basically another sticky little bit of scabies on some,

1570
01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:02.220
yes.
Herpes infested prostitutes,
Vagina.

1571
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.500
But then if I look around and think,
wow man,

1572
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:09.210
these are all expansions of the earth.
These are all expressions of the universe.

1573
01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:14.280
Here is the universe expressing itself in,
in,
in this is nature.
Sure.

1574
01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:15.630
Am I,
I'm not in South America,

1575
01:29:15.631 --> 01:29:19.860
I'm not surrounded by green and trees and I don't hear the sounds of the jungle,

1576
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.980
but I am still surrounded by the natural world taking a very specific form of

1577
01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:28.620
man of manifesting in a specific way we call civilization.

1578
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:32.790
And the moment I see it like that,
suddenly things get better.

1579
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:36.480
It feels like I make connections more.
It seems like the,

1580
01:29:36.481 --> 01:29:40.670
it talks to you when we talked to each other,
we are the universe talking to it.

1581
01:29:40.671 --> 01:29:45.420
So do you believe in God?
I believe in a higher intelligence.

1582
01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:48.990
I think the word God is a real confusing word,
but as a term of convenience,

1583
01:29:48.991 --> 01:29:53.400
I'll say the reason I ask is that a,
that's essentially how I look at religion.

1584
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:58.401
It's like people can choose to believe in something like that because it makes

1585
01:29:58.471 --> 01:30:02.160
their immediate experience more pleasant.
Well,
I,
not to get into semantics,

1586
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:05.700
but I think you should separate religion from belief in God because I think,

1587
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:09.790
I think you pull those those things away and then,
and then you,

1588
01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:12.720
you get into this idea of like,
oh,
you're just making yourself feel better,

1589
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.200
and so you're sort of diluting yourself to try to turn your eyes away from

1590
01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:20.760
they're raging fires of hell because the fact is the locust vision and the

1591
01:30:20.761 --> 01:30:25.430
enlightened beings and magic of the universe vision are both true.
Exactly.

1592
01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:29.450
<v 1>I'd leave open the possibility of a higher intelligence space in the fact that</v>

1593
01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:34.070
if you look at the senses that some animals provide,
there's a lot of animals,

1594
01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:37.580
a lot of lifeforms on this planet that literally don't have the sensors to

1595
01:30:37.581 --> 01:30:41.150
detect us because we don't,
we're not involved in their world on a regular basis.

1596
01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.580
There's certain animals,
you wave your hand over a slug.

1597
01:30:43.581 --> 01:30:46.370
They have no fucking idea here.
There they don't care.

1598
01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.470
They know there's certain animals that are like that,

1599
01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:53.060
that don't have the ability to perceive whether it's fungus or whether it's

1600
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:54.710
micro organisms or whatever it is.

1601
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:57.170
Why would we assume that this is the end of the line?

1602
01:30:57.350 --> 01:31:02.140
Why would we assume that in our complex,
very limited,
in fact would,
you know,

1603
01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:05.660
we have so many,
so few senses,
we have them numbered.
I mean,

1604
01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.110
why would we assume that those are the only census to be had and there's not

1605
01:31:09.111 --> 01:31:12.380
some sort of a next step,
next dimension.

1606
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.900
And the difference between,
you know,

1607
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:18.560
oceanic creatures with no eyeballs and a person living in a penthouse in

1608
01:31:18.561 --> 01:31:21.600
Manhattan might as well call that a different dimension.
Sure.

1609
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:23.570
You might as well because it kind of is.

1610
01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:26.360
And why would we assume that this is the end of the line?

1611
01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:31.040
That our ability to perceive and adjust our material world is the only one like

1612
01:31:31.041 --> 01:31:31.940
that out there.

1613
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:37.040
And there's not something way more advanced that exists in the very fiber of the

1614
01:31:37.041 --> 01:31:40.550
universe itself.
And we can't detect yet because we're primitive.

1615
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:42.300
<v 7>Well,
it's like size,
right?</v>

1616
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.080
We assume size and time.

1617
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.120
We judge it from here,
like our experiences,
the zero in our number system.

1618
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:53.220
Right?
But,
uh,
you know,

1619
01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:58.221
like things become infinitesimally small and they become infinite [inaudible] so

1620
01:31:58.651 --> 01:32:01.780
we're not at the middle of anything because there are no ends to it.
Right.

1621
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.170
But we just sort of randomly choose it and say,
well,
this is normal.

1622
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:07.750
Anything smaller than this is small.
Anything bigger as bigger,

1623
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:12.610
anything that goes faster than my experience of time is speed it up and anything

1624
01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:15.220
that goes slower is slowed down.
It's like,
well,
what the fuck?

1625
01:32:15.221 --> 01:32:18.310
What your assumption is bullshit there because it's based on nothing.

1626
01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.330
Light travels faster than what you

1627
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:26.710
fucking crazy bitch.
Yeah.
Also the assumption

1628
01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.910
<v 1>Chin up the birth and the death of the universe itself.</v>

1629
01:32:29.150 --> 01:32:33.470
I've always wondered why we need to attribute these biological characteristics

1630
01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.500
like birth and death to the universe.
Like why would we,

1631
01:32:36.501 --> 01:32:39.380
would we automatically do that with no assumptions?
No,

1632
01:32:39.381 --> 01:32:42.050
we do it based on our own personal limitations.

1633
01:32:42.051 --> 01:32:45.530
The fact that we know that we live and die.
Other things live and die.

1634
01:32:45.531 --> 01:32:47.720
We're pretty sure planets live and die.

1635
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:51.170
We're pretty sure sons have a life and then they burn.
We know it.

1636
01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:53.630
They've supernovas.
We know that sons die out.

1637
01:32:53.631 --> 01:32:57.050
We know our son has a certain amount of time left and then it's over.
We know it.

1638
01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.690
So we just assumed that the whole universe is like that.

1639
01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:00.171
<v 7>Yeah.
Well,</v>

1640
01:33:00.171 --> 01:33:04.880
we use the term die to refer to that moment of radical change that happens in

1641
01:33:04.881 --> 01:33:08.960
everything in the universe when it goes from being from one form to the next.

1642
01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:13.850
But it isn't really a death.
It's just a radical,
radical fucking change.
You know?

1643
01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.870
It's interesting.
Yeah.

1644
01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:18.390
We don't talk about the death of water when it becomes ice now,
you know,

1645
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:22.150
although melting has a little bit of death in it,
maybe,
well,
it's just changed.

1646
01:33:22.151 --> 01:33:25.640
We're just like,
that's the thing.
It's like we're in this constantly morphing,

1647
01:33:25.641 --> 01:33:30.230
changing thing,
this constantly changing world.
And you get to,

1648
01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:32.850
I think what you said about where existing in these two plants,

1649
01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.920
all these dimensions.

1650
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:37.310
One is the dimension where it's a bunch of locus chewing up a living planet.

1651
01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:41.930
Another dimension is where the living planet has sprouted a sensory,

1652
01:33:42.230 --> 01:33:46.430
um,
sensory sensory,
I don't know what you call it.
It's the what?

1653
01:33:46.431 --> 01:33:49.550
Sensory organs.
Organs,
which are,
yeah,
right?
It's that.

1654
01:33:49.551 --> 01:33:53.420
Or it's like that which are human [inaudible] who said human beings are the

1655
01:33:53.421 --> 01:33:56.210
universe looking back at itself.
Yes.
There's that.

1656
01:33:56.211 --> 01:33:59.480
And then these are considered like,
uh,
Ron doss talks about this,

1657
01:33:59.481 --> 01:34:02.810
how there's this channels that you can dial into and you get to decide what

1658
01:34:02.811 --> 01:34:04.040
channel you want to dial into.

1659
01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.610
So if you want to live in like the Fox News dimension,

1660
01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.760
you can live there where you're constantly,
your fists are clenched.

1661
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:12.110
You're watching bill O'Reilly.

1662
01:34:12.111 --> 01:34:15.890
Everything Obama does makes you want to fucking kill yourself or kill somebody

1663
01:34:15.891 --> 01:34:20.000
else in your stomach is bubbling your chain smoking and listening to rush

1664
01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:23.510
Limbaugh and beeping at anyone who liked cuts in front of you in the wrong way.

1665
01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:25.460
That's a dimension.
You're in a dimension.

1666
01:34:25.461 --> 01:34:29.870
You're in a specific universe where you're at war with all these liberals.

1667
01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:33.620
Blahblahblah and Coulter is the goddess,
whatever.
So like,

1668
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:36.200
but there are all these different channels that you can tune into.

1669
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:41.240
And one of them is this channel where you just believe that everything's

1670
01:34:41.241 --> 01:34:45.200
perfect.
And that is blasphemy to a lot of people.

1671
01:34:45.201 --> 01:34:46.370
They don't want to fucking hear that.

1672
01:34:46.371 --> 01:34:48.330
They don't want to hear that everything's perfect cause then they say,

1673
01:34:48.331 --> 01:34:52.010
you don't look at the fucking radiation Fukushima holocausts people dying,

1674
01:34:52.011 --> 01:34:54.770
cancer kids that hyenas are killing the,

1675
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:59.830
the the fucking though l we're all dying.
Everything's on fire door.

1676
01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:03.410
The Sun's going to Supernova.
How dare you say everything's perfect,
you know?

1677
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:04.251
But if you,

1678
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:07.910
but if you start just playing around with that idea and tuning into that idea

1679
01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:12.380
that no,
no,
no,
this is perfect.
This is a beautiful universe.
I look at it Hubble,

1680
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:17.530
the Hubble telescope and I see those incredible just deeps fields of stars out

1681
01:35:18.381 --> 01:35:22.130
there and I see the supernovas and I see all these things and I don't think,

1682
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:26.360
Oh God,
the violence of the Supernova,
as it evaporates,
everything around it,

1683
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.350
I don't think,
Oh God,
the monster black hole sucking this dimension into it.

1684
01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.350
And I don't think any scientist or cosmologists would look at that and be like,

1685
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:38.120
Dad,
is violence happening in evil?
Yet somehow when it gets down to us,

1686
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.990
these little fucking little meaty things,
that's where the things malfunctioning.

1687
01:35:41.991 --> 01:35:45.230
Now the black hole is fine.
It's not evil.
That's not a demon.

1688
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:50.450
The black hole sucking fucking light into it.
That's not evil.

1689
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:55.460
But suddenly when it comes down to us,
it's like,
yeah,
we're monstrous.

1690
01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.860
Asteroids killed the dinosaurs.
Yeah.

1691
01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.940
<v 0>Chunk of metal flying 45,000 miles an hour through space,</v>

1692
01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:06.500
slams into the earth and it's several miles deep within the first couple
seconds.

1693
01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:09.590
I say forever.
Forgive us,

1694
01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.920
<v 7>but you're right to yes.
That's the thing.
You get to pick where you want to be.</v>

1695
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:18.140
The guy throwing cans out the window is still a Douche bag.

1696
01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.090
Do you know the locusts and grasshoppers are the same animal?
No,

1697
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:25.920
I didn't.
It's the same.
Same animals executable.

1698
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:28.910
<v 2>Yeah.
What happens is you've got a bunch of grasshoppers,
right?</v>

1699
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.600
If there's not enough food,
the uh,

1700
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:34.460
below a certain caloric intake,

1701
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:39.490
they metamorphosize into locusts and they swarm and take off.

1702
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:41.000
Wow.
Isn't that funny?

1703
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:44.540
I'm thinking about that a lot as a metaphor for human nature,
right?

1704
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:46.730
Cause we're talking about how fucked up the word nature is.

1705
01:36:46.731 --> 01:36:49.880
And everybody's always asking me,
having written this book and whatever,
you know,

1706
01:36:49.881 --> 01:36:52.370
what is it?
Human nature to do this human nature to do that.

1707
01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:56.480
It's like talking about locus and grasshoppers.
I think you,
we,

1708
01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.460
we become a different kind of being based upon our contacts.

1709
01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.810
<v 0>That's not just insects.
That's wild pigs as well.</v>

1710
01:37:05.230 --> 01:37:10.210
Wild pigs and domestic pigs are the same exact animal and for it was explaining

1711
01:37:10.211 --> 01:37:14.390
that that wild pigs,
it's,
I forget the exact term,
what,
what,

1712
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:18.940
what the pig,
you know what gender it is,
but when they move out,

1713
01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:22.690
like if like you get a wild pig and you release it out into the wild,

1714
01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:27.640
within three weeks they start changing.
Their body changes,
their snout extends,

1715
01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:31.990
their hair becomes darker and courser and their tusks grow like the hulk.
Yeah.

1716
01:37:31.991 --> 01:37:35.620
They grow these fucking crazy prongs.
When you see a wild boar,

1717
01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.670
that's the same thing as a domestic pig.
It's literally the same animal,

1718
01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:43.830
various an animal that morphs when it has to take care of itself.
Yeah.

1719
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.150
If you leave a wild pig in it,
yeah.
There they are.

1720
01:37:46.210 --> 01:37:48.970
Look at the differences between those two animals.
Those are the same animal,

1721
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.170
the exact same animal,

1722
01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:53.660
but the one on the right is wild and the one on the left is domesticated.
No

1723
01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.710
<v 2>human beings.
There you are on the left,</v>

1724
01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:01.120
<v 1>on the right.
Uh,
hunter gatherers,
Sasquatch maybe.
No,
no.
It's still human beings.</v>

1725
01:38:01.121 --> 01:38:03.160
That's the point.
It's still human beings.
Yes.

1726
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:07.380
Fuck up their environment.
Yeah.

1727
01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.490
Hunter gatherers and I'm sure they don't go well.

1728
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:14.530
They fuck up the golf course is what they fuck up.
They fuck up.

1729
01:38:14.531 --> 01:38:17.230
Fuck you don't fuck up farmland.
That's not the right,

1730
01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:18.970
that's not their environment.
That's the point.

1731
01:38:18.971 --> 01:38:21.080
They're disruptive to all your official environment.

1732
01:38:21.081 --> 01:38:23.590
Let's not a point because they're not,
they're not from here.

1733
01:38:23.591 --> 01:38:25.870
They're not indigenous species.
We brought them in entirely,

1734
01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.350
which gets back to why the Aztecs were cannibals.
By the way,

1735
01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.350
if pigs had existed in North America,
they wouldn't have been the,
yeah.

1736
01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:38.290
Pigs are so crazy with how they reproduce,
dear only reproduce once a year.

1737
01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.160
So they did.
They'd spit out a couple of fonts.
Pigs reproduce all year round.

1738
01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.130
They ship them out every three or four months and they shit out like eight or

1739
01:38:45.131 --> 01:38:47.530
nine of them,
you know or you know if a good litter,

1740
01:38:47.531 --> 01:38:51.190
but I saw a bunch of wild pigs and they had like a whole crew behind them.

1741
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:53.220
They have the,
they traveled.

1742
01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:57.340
These packs like this is one video of wild pigs running through the woods.

1743
01:38:57.730 --> 01:38:59.480
I don't know.
I put it on my Twitter a while back.

1744
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:02.080
It probably really hard to find it,
but if you just find this video,

1745
01:39:02.081 --> 01:39:03.670
it's the most insane thing you've ever seen.

1746
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:07.600
It's like you're watching the Lord of the rings and a Goblin Army.

1747
01:39:07.601 --> 01:39:10.990
It's like trudging through the town here.
Crazy man.

1748
01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:14.980
We went hunting them and we were in this place called to hone ranch and where

1749
01:39:14.981 --> 01:39:17.620
that door is,
which is probably what,
20 feet away,

1750
01:39:17.621 --> 01:39:22.510
30 feet away that close pigs were fighting in the bushes and we're standing

1751
01:39:22.511 --> 01:39:26.800
there with rifles and the bushes are rattling like it's Jurassic Park and he

1752
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.960
[inaudible] with each other tasks and then these crazy looking wild shaggy dark

1753
01:39:36.401 --> 01:39:40.300
things.
That's the same as babe.
Yeah,

1754
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:43.470
same God damn animal.
Depending upon the circumstances,

1755
01:39:43.471 --> 01:39:46.810
if they have to fend for themselves,
if you take out all the,

1756
01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:50.440
the aggression of the,
the natural world so they don't have to be on,

1757
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.390
on point from the moment they're born,

1758
01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:54.220
they don't have to be like aware of predators,

1759
01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.410
little piggies and not afraid of shit.
It's the same animals,
the same animals.

1760
01:39:58.411 --> 01:40:03.400
A wild boar without civilization.
Yeah.
The Universe is very complex,

1761
01:40:03.401 --> 01:40:04.060
man.

1762
01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:09.060
And there's so much adaptability within the natural world and quotes with the

1763
01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:13.840
world of organisms.
There's so much adaptability.
It's absolutely,
totally,

1764
01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:14.830
completely fascinating.

1765
01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.840
<v 2>Getting back to your point about,
you know,</v>

1766
01:40:16.841 --> 01:40:20.620
higher beings and why do we assume that we're the end of some spectrum,
you know,

1767
01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:26.050
uh,
another indication for me is just,
there are,
I mean,
I'm no mathematician,

1768
01:40:26.051 --> 01:40:28.960
but there are some like mathematical principles that are just too fucking

1769
01:40:28.961 --> 01:40:32.680
beautiful to be random.
And I mean,

1770
01:40:32.681 --> 01:40:34.120
I've had experiences traveling.

1771
01:40:34.121 --> 01:40:36.520
I'm sure you guys have had experiences where it's like,
Holy Shit,

1772
01:40:36.521 --> 01:40:38.440
that can't have just happened.
You know,

1773
01:40:38.441 --> 01:40:42.970
there is no rational way to understand how that just happened.
But a a,

1774
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:47.080
a sort of universal one,
which uh,
I ended sex at dawn with is the,

1775
01:40:47.081 --> 01:40:50.870
the sun moon thing.
Do you know about this?
That,
okay,
so the,

1776
01:40:50.871 --> 01:40:54.040
the moon is obviously a fraction the size of the earth,

1777
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.730
<v 4>right?</v>

1778
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:57.370
<v 0>One,
fourth,
one fourth,</v>

1779
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:59.320
<v 4>one fourth.
Really?
Is that right?
Yeah.</v>

1780
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:00.690
And I would have thought much smaller than it.

1781
01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.130
It's extraordinarily large for a moon.

1782
01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:02.521
<v 0>In fact,</v>

1783
01:41:02.521 --> 01:41:05.190
that's one of the reasons why a lot of the ancients thought of it as a planet,

1784
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:07.363
Huh?

1785
01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:11.290
<v 4>Yeah.
It doesn't move like a planet though.
No,
it stays.
There's no regrets.</v>

1786
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.600
Regrets,
Shane,
if it spins around us,
but it doesn't spin in the air.
Right.

1787
01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:18.660
It just floats around.
It's the same side is always facing anyway.

1788
01:41:18.661 --> 01:41:21.090
So the moon is much smaller than the earth and the sun is far,

1789
01:41:21.091 --> 01:41:24.930
far got a hundreds of thousands of times larger.
Right.
And as you said,

1790
01:41:24.931 --> 01:41:26.730
the moon is this,
you know,
very important.

1791
01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:29.490
Obviously it's important to every civilization there,
every,

1792
01:41:29.491 --> 01:41:31.230
every culture that's ever existed.

1793
01:41:31.231 --> 01:41:35.370
The moon is often seen as feminine because of the changes and its association

1794
01:41:35.371 --> 01:41:39.060
with menstruation and so on.
And so forth.
And the sun obviously is super,

1795
01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:39.301
you know,

1796
01:41:39.301 --> 01:41:42.450
those are the two most important things that anyone's ever thought about.

1797
01:41:42.451 --> 01:41:42.720
You know,

1798
01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:47.720
in terms of like immediately obvious symbols and they appear to be exactly the

1799
01:41:49.171 --> 01:41:54.171
same size in the sky because the distance of the sun exactly compensates for

1800
01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.600
larger diameter.
It's interesting.
So you have to,

1801
01:41:57.601 --> 01:42:02.601
if you take the diameter of the moon divided by the distance from the surface of

1802
01:42:02.731 --> 01:42:06.840
earth,
it equals the diameter of the sun divided by the distance.

1803
01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:09.240
So that those two things appear exactly the same.

1804
01:42:09.241 --> 01:42:14.241
And you have these solar eclipses where the disc of the moon perfectly covers

1805
01:42:14.821 --> 01:42:19.560
the disc of the sun.
That is mathematically like,
how the fuck did that happen?

1806
01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.640
Is there is no reason mathematically for that to happen to gravitational law

1807
01:42:23.641 --> 01:42:28.440
though?
No,
it's not.
If you look at the,
in fact I talked to people about this,

1808
01:42:28.441 --> 01:42:30.120
you look at,
um,

1809
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.650
what the moons of Jupiter look like from the surface of Jupiter.
They're not,

1810
01:42:34.730 --> 01:42:38.340
they have no relation to the size of the sun as seen from the surface of
Jupiter.

1811
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:42.960
Right.
But Jupiter is a gas planet,
right?
Isn't that different?
Don't look at me.

1812
01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:46.890
There's not a gas plant.
It's not Saturn is Jupiter's not a gas giant?

1813
01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:50.310
I don't think so.
We can,
we can look it up.
I know there's,

1814
01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:55.090
did you guys just watched cosmos?
The oven.
So there,
cause there's a thing

1815
01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:59.670
<v 0>called bodes law of that based on the amount of mass that a planet has,</v>

1816
01:42:59.671 --> 01:43:03.540
you can accurately predict where the next planet will be and it works.

1817
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:07.110
Apparently it's a Jovian planet.

1818
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:12.270
It's a large planet that it's not primarily composed of rock or any solid
matter.

1819
01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:17.040
Yeah,
it's a gas giant.
What happens is four gas giants hold on a second.
Uh,

1820
01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:19.800
Jupiter,
Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune,
those are all gas giants.

1821
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:22.530
What happens if you fall into a gas giant?
You're fucked.

1822
01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.060
It's a big swirling ball of death.

1823
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:32.040
<v 4>Well it says not primarily.
So no condom.
There's some solids within it,
right?</v>

1824
01:43:32.041 --> 01:43:34.920
I mean it's like a,
it's like a conglomeration of,

1825
01:43:34.921 --> 01:43:37.620
it's just not primarily can pose of solid matter.

1826
01:43:38.290 --> 01:43:41.100
He probably couldn't fucking hurricanes of death.

1827
01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:44.130
There's this dorms that have been going on since the beginning of time that are

1828
01:43:44.131 --> 01:43:47.160
bigger than our planet.
The red spot.
Yeah.
It's just a storm.

1829
01:43:47.161 --> 01:43:50.280
It's this earth sized storm that's been going on forever,

1830
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.310
which is the one with that crazy shape

1831
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.490
<v 7>at the top that spins around.
Is that Jupiter?
Saturn?</v>

1832
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:56.990
You know what I'm talking about?
The One?
Yeah.

1833
01:43:57.070 --> 01:44:01.040
<v 1>Oh yeah.
That's sad.
Saturn.
Yeah.
It's got like a hexagon.
The top of it.
Yeah.</v>

1834
01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:05.790
It's really bizarre.
It almost looks like a design,
but so is everything.
I mean,

1835
01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.461
you know the,

1836
01:44:06.461 --> 01:44:09.930
the lower you get and you start looking at different aspects of nature,

1837
01:44:09.931 --> 01:44:13.110
everything gets like,
look at ice crystals under a microscope.

1838
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:17.810
<v 4>Oh No.
Like salt.
Look at salt and graves of sand.</v>

1839
01:44:17.811 --> 01:44:21.410
Have you seen that book?
This guy who takes micro photographs of grains of sand.

1840
01:44:21.411 --> 01:44:23.390
Amazing fucking wild man.

1841
01:44:23.391 --> 01:44:28.080
All different colors and little pieces of sea shells and coral and they're like

1842
01:44:28.081 --> 01:44:30.980
you.
They're all these wild crystal and things.
I just,

1843
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:35.480
you assume every grain of sand is the same.
Yeah.
They're amazing.
Yeah.

1844
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.980
That's it.
Want that.

1845
01:44:36.981 --> 01:44:40.400
Once you start getting the doors tuning into that channel that we're talking

1846
01:44:40.401 --> 01:44:45.000
about now,
suddenly the locust are gone.
Now the world's amazing.
Yeah.

1847
01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:48.970
Wow.
Look at these beautiful place that we're,
oh,
there you go.
Yeah.

1848
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.630
Pictures of Sam.
Yeah.
Wow.

1849
01:44:50.850 --> 01:44:52.140
<v 1>And you know,
those aren't uniform,</v>

1850
01:44:52.141 --> 01:44:53.850
but I mean there are many things in nature that are,

1851
01:44:53.851 --> 01:44:55.050
I mean the FIBONACCI sequence,

1852
01:44:55.051 --> 01:44:58.500
it exists in flowers and pine cones and all these different things and ms

1853
01:44:58.510 --> 01:45:00.240
essentially perfect geometric pattern.

1854
01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.480
<v 7>And that to me has got in there.
It is right there all the time,</v>

1855
01:45:03.481 --> 01:45:04.380
right next to you.

1856
01:45:04.530 --> 01:45:09.030
If you just take a little bit of time to get yourself out of the perception,

1857
01:45:09.210 --> 01:45:11.970
uh,
that whatever the perception is that you've become accustomed to.

1858
01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.390
And that is like,
that's what they call,
I mean in,

1859
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:16.470
in like a cult systems are in magic.

1860
01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:21.300
That's like one of the first things you want to do is to like pull yourself out

1861
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.830
of whatever your conditioned patterns are so that you could see the world is

1862
01:45:25.831 --> 01:45:28.030
living even for a moment.
It's a,
it's a,

1863
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:31.830
I really love chaos magic because it's like a postmodern form of magic that

1864
01:45:31.831 --> 01:45:35.640
isn't based on like,
this magic is real like Harry Potter Shit.

1865
01:45:35.641 --> 01:45:39.420
It's based on the,
if you can change the way you feel,

1866
01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:43.110
then you're going to change your life.
You know,
like if you,
if you can,

1867
01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:47.370
if you can induce certain mood states in inside of you,

1868
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:50.100
then you're going to be more inspired.
You're going to write better,

1869
01:45:50.101 --> 01:45:52.930
you're going to be a better athlete.
So that's what it is.
So the,

1870
01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:57.930
the rituals that you use to induce those states,
that's considered,

1871
01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.100
that's what magic is.
Or that's one form of magic.
So it's like the ideas,

1872
01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:06.060
one really fun experiment you can do.
It's really cool,
man.

1873
01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:08.910
This is an a book I write about chaos magic.
You,
um,

1874
01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.900
go to like a place where there's shit loads of people and you put yourself in a

1875
01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:19.340
intentionally paranoid state.
Not Paranoid is in you're afraid,
but paranoid is,

1876
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:23.850
is in the sense that everything happening around you is the universe conversing

1877
01:46:23.851 --> 01:46:27.540
with you for like 15 minutes.
Now the universe is talking to you.

1878
01:46:27.541 --> 01:46:31.500
So every accident,
every moment,
every tee shirt that has something written on it,

1879
01:46:31.501 --> 01:46:36.180
every song that you hear is related to,
uh,
answering whatever your question is.

1880
01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:40.260
So like an oracle or something like that.
And because our minds,
uh,

1881
01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:43.980
consist not just to the conscious but also the subconscious.

1882
01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:48.660
Suddenly you'll start seeing reflections of your subconscious in the workings of

1883
01:46:48.661 --> 01:46:49.770
the world.
You

1884
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.700
<v 3>and that can answer your question or give you some kind of like information that</v>

1885
01:46:53.701 --> 01:46:54.211
you're seeking.

1886
01:46:54.211 --> 01:46:56.790
You really is the information coming from the world or inside of you.

1887
01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:01.050
It doesn't matter if you find a solution that gives you a course of action to

1888
01:47:01.051 --> 01:47:05.390
take that betters your life,
you know,
so it's good to not think that were,

1889
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.420
I don't mean to keep going back to this,
but if you think that your,
uh,
a plague,

1890
01:47:09.421 --> 01:47:11.910
then that from a,
a cult lens,

1891
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.120
that would be a spell that you're casting that would be considered a rich,

1892
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:17.900
you know what I mean?
That's like an actual,
um,

1893
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:23.010
you're actually going to induce a specific reaction from the universe around you

1894
01:47:23.011 --> 01:47:27.130
that maybe,
and maybe won't be so good.
Cause if you're a fucking locust,

1895
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:29.190
what's the universe around you?

1896
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:33.090
I think there's no denying that there's several factors involved in your life

1897
01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:34.140
and shaping your life.

1898
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:38.880
And I think there has to be some impact other than attitudinal,

1899
01:47:38.881 --> 01:47:41.760
if that's a word that comes out of the way you perceive things,

1900
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:45.810
that it might not just be,
oh well you're looking at things the wrong way,

1901
01:47:45.811 --> 01:47:46.860
you're going to be sad.
No,

1902
01:47:46.861 --> 01:47:50.040
it might be that you're shaping the energy that you produce.

1903
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:53.130
These shaping what you put out,
you're shaping how people receive you.

1904
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:56.520
And that may in turn shaped the very physical world around you.

1905
01:47:56.521 --> 01:48:00.900
The same way wolves change rivers.
Yeah.
And in the end,

1906
01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.900
the loan you take is equal to the love you make.
Yeah.

1907
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.300
I mean they figured that shit out in the hippy days.

1908
01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:12.780
<v 2>Yeah.
And isn't that what they meant?
Yeah.
And at the end of that great song</v>

1909
01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:15.490
<v 3>threw gas on the whole thing,</v>

1910
01:48:15.730 --> 01:48:19.030
just get yourself all worked up in a nice paranoids froth,

1911
01:48:19.031 --> 01:48:20.440
which I am quite good at doing.

1912
01:48:20.441 --> 01:48:22.750
And then go into the world and you'll notice everyone's a dick.

1913
01:48:23.050 --> 01:48:24.850
If you ever noticed that when you're really,
you know,

1914
01:48:24.851 --> 01:48:26.140
like all of a sudden it's like,
God man,

1915
01:48:26.141 --> 01:48:28.100
everyone's being such a fucking cunt today.
Huh?

1916
01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:31.260
<v 2>Did you realize every time I'm in la I noticed that man</v>

1917
01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:36.960
creates a aggression within within me.
You know,

1918
01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.020
it's what you were saying earlier,
like people cut you off,
you get all angry.

1919
01:48:40.021 --> 01:48:42.960
It's,
I mean,
I used to,
when I was traveling a lot,

1920
01:48:42.961 --> 01:48:46.620
I first noticed this sort of phenomenon and I always thought of it as the,
the,

1921
01:48:46.621 --> 01:48:50.820
you know,
on a crowded bus phenomenon.
I get on the bus in Mexico,
whatever,

1922
01:48:50.821 --> 01:48:53.790
all the seats are taken,
I'm standing there,
it's a five hour bus ride.

1923
01:48:53.791 --> 01:48:57.030
I'm like tired,
I haven't slept,

1924
01:48:57.031 --> 01:49:00.810
I've got diarrhea and I'm sorta like leaning on the seat.

1925
01:49:00.811 --> 01:49:04.380
And the dude whose shoulder my ass touches occasionally is kind of getting

1926
01:49:04.381 --> 01:49:07.830
uptight and I'm thinking,
what an asshole that guy is.
You know,
fuck,

1927
01:49:07.831 --> 01:49:09.120
I'm standing here,
you know?

1928
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.090
At least he could do is let me lean on the seat without giving me shit,
whatever.

1929
01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:13.740
And then the guy gets up,
gets off the bus,

1930
01:49:13.741 --> 01:49:16.350
I sit down someone else's standing there and they start,

1931
01:49:16.351 --> 01:49:21.060
their ass starts touching my shoulder and I get pissed off and I'm like,
yeah,

1932
01:49:21.061 --> 01:49:24.000
there you go.
It all depends on where I am.
You know,

1933
01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:29.001
like I am such a fucking hypocrite because my perception of this situation is

1934
01:49:29.551 --> 01:49:32.990
not accurate.
It's it's,
you know,
it is,

1935
01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:37.260
or it is accurate in both cases,
but both cases are true.
Now imagine this,

1936
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.720
imagine an eat either of those situations.

1937
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:44.220
You had just met a girl and fallen in love and you don't give a shit.
Yeah,

1938
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:46.350
exactly.
Exactly right.
You're in love.

1939
01:49:46.351 --> 01:49:48.010
It doesn't matter if someone's rubbing against

1940
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.843
<v 7>you.
It doesn't matter.</v>

1941
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:52.240
Fucking dog could probably come and start chewing on your ankle.

1942
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:54.160
It's going to suck,
but you're not.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1943
01:49:54.161 --> 01:49:55.120
So that's honestly,

1944
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:58.780
that's why I traveled so much because traveling put me in the state of mine were

1945
01:49:58.781 --> 01:49:59.740
nothing bothered me.

1946
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:04.050
But the idea is I always felt so lucky and happy to be wherever the fuck I was.

1947
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:05.890
Here's the big question.

1948
01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.570
Can we induce that state of feeling love in love,

1949
01:50:10.571 --> 01:50:13.960
whatever you want to call it,
minus a condition.
So in other words,

1950
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.140
is there a way to actually,
do we have the controller?

1951
01:50:17.141 --> 01:50:20.980
Is it already inside of us to find this place where we're constantly

1952
01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:25.120
experiencing that feeling of intense love wherever we go?

1953
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:29.380
Because if you're feeling that the traffic doesn't suck,
nothing really sucks.

1954
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.420
You know,
I said this on Ari's podcast,

1955
01:50:31.421 --> 01:50:36.421
which is like do something you have with someone you hate and something you hate

1956
01:50:36.971 --> 01:50:41.170
with someone you love and you'll see how potent the state of feeling and love
is.

1957
01:50:41.171 --> 01:50:43.090
Because if you do something you hate with someone you love,

1958
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.680
you don't hate the fucking thing anymore.

1959
01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:48.370
But if you do something we love with someone who sucks,
it's no fun.

1960
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:49.780
It's a miserable situation.

1961
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:51.341
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1962
01:50:51.341 --> 01:50:56.040
I mean there's also the question of are you trying to have it in,

1963
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:56.351
in,

1964
01:50:56.351 --> 01:51:01.351
in asking for this state of love and bliss and whatever it is that the mistakes

1965
01:51:02.111 --> 01:51:04.180
are always guiding us toward.

1966
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.380
Is that an illegitimate request in the sense that,
you know,

1967
01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:10.690
is that an ultimately selfish request?
You're saying,

1968
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.440
I want pleasure without pain.
I want light without darkness.
I want bliss.

1969
01:51:14.441 --> 01:51:17.980
Without despair,
aren't those things?

1970
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:21.790
Is there light without darkness?
You know,
is for now,

1971
01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:27.270
for now,
you'll get your darkness later.
You'll get plenty of darkness now.

1972
01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:32.050
For now.
Well,
that's sort of how I feel.
I feel like,
you know,
I've had,
uh,

1973
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:36.430
you know,
if I,
if I tallied up my life,
I would say it's 90% great.

1974
01:51:36.730 --> 01:51:40.090
I would say more than 90% well,
look where you're at right now.
Yeah,
no,
whatever.

1975
01:51:40.091 --> 01:51:42.220
I mean,
but again,
that's one of those things like,
pick,

1976
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:45.970
pick your perspective in the valley looks different depending on where you're

1977
01:51:45.971 --> 01:51:50.140
standing on,
you know,
it's always,
this condition is 100% great.

1978
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.740
Yes.
It's just mappings.
All hundred percent.

1979
01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:56.040
<v 1>No,
this is right now,
this condition right now we're in is 100% great.</v>

1980
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:59.340
There's nothing negative about it.
We're putting out all this conversation.

1981
01:51:59.370 --> 01:52:02.670
A lot of people are enjoying it.
They're thinking we're,
we're sparking ideas.

1982
01:52:02.671 --> 01:52:04.290
We're having a good time together as friends.

1983
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:07.560
We're having a good time talking and stimulating each other.
This.
I mean,

1984
01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:10.760
these podcasts are awesome.
It's really cool and unique moments.

1985
01:52:10.761 --> 01:52:14.760
So for me right now,
I'm having 100% good time and this is what I'm judging.

1986
01:52:14.850 --> 01:52:18.150
I'm judging this moment,
this moment,
which you,

1987
01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:20.680
it's all about maintaining your balance on this tight rope.

1988
01:52:20.681 --> 01:52:21.770
How long can you stay?
Yeah.

1989
01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.690
<v 7>Yes.
That's it man.
The razor's edge,
right?
That's what they say in Buddhism.</v>

1990
01:52:25.691 --> 01:52:28.510
Walking the spiritual path is a great book.
Is Tricky.

1991
01:52:28.511 --> 01:52:31.600
Is treading upon the edge of a razor.
Yes.
Beautiful Book.

1992
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:35.470
Travel and a secret,
like the movie to the razors.

1993
01:52:35.471 --> 01:52:39.910
I never saw the bill Murray.
Oh,
Bill Murray Gray.
Yeah,
but,
but,

1994
01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:43.990
but yeah man,
that's the thing.
Dan,
I love like the other day man,

1995
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:49.040
how has taken walk and I hit that fucking place by the river,
the La River.

1996
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.401
This is,

1997
01:52:49.401 --> 01:52:52.310
I keep having that by the La River when I go for these walks and I'll hit this

1998
01:52:52.311 --> 01:52:56.840
place where it's like,
oh,
this is amazing.

1999
01:52:56.841 --> 01:53:00.020
This feels so good.
And then I'll think,

2000
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:04.160
I want this feeling to last forever and then it's gone because I'm trying to

2001
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:08.060
grasp at it.
I'm trying to fucking hold it.
Yeah,
that's that on Neil Young,

2002
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:11.600
that Neil young song love is a rose,
but you better not pick,

2003
01:53:11.601 --> 01:53:15.920
it only grows when it's on the vine and full of thorns and you know you've

2004
01:53:15.921 --> 01:53:20.210
missed it.
Lose your love when you say the word mind,
you know when you're,

2005
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:23.270
when you're trying to grab it,
when you want it to last,
when you're like,
no,

2006
01:53:23.271 --> 01:53:27.230
I don't want it to go away.
Go it flees and terror.
Oh awesome.
Is Neil Young?

2007
01:53:27.231 --> 01:53:30.920
He's the greatest man.
You should get him on this podcast.
So cool.

2008
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:35.270
<v 0>You know,
he makes his own bio diesel makes his own gasoline.</v>

2009
01:53:35.271 --> 01:53:38.360
He has a farm and he makes his own gasoline.
Did run a diesel truck with,

2010
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:42.070
he used to live right here in Topanga.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the worst.

2011
01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:43.040
Now I want to talk him.

2012
01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:46.100
It's a bad mother fucker to dog every skill in la somewhere.

2013
01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:50.090
I was working at a great wood center for the Performing Arts in Mansfield,

2014
01:53:50.091 --> 01:53:53.620
Massachusetts at a,
at a Neil Young concert once and uh,

2015
01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:57.440
it was the craziest concert ever because people couldn't hear well,

2016
01:53:57.670 --> 01:54:01.550
like it was the,
the setup wasn't very good that day for whatever reason.

2017
01:54:01.551 --> 01:54:05.310
And so the people in the top,
there was so much talking like the tea,

2018
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.570
the top area was like this grassy area.
There was so much talking.
It was like,

2019
01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:10.010
it was like riots almost.

2020
01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.520
And then people started lighting fires and people had snuck in booze and they

2021
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:15.290
had to shut the concert.
Ah,
they had a shot,

2022
01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:19.010
literally stopped the concert because there's so much chaos and it was all in a

2023
01:54:19.011 --> 01:54:19.844
Neil young concert

2024
01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:21.490
<v 7>at sac.</v>

2025
01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:24.640
<v 0>It was wild.
It was wild.
It was wild being there.</v>

2026
01:54:24.641 --> 01:54:28.270
I put a jacket on over my security jacket.
I was like,
fuck this.

2027
01:54:28.271 --> 01:54:31.390
I'm blending in the crowd.
I zipped up and got the fuck out of dodge.

2028
01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:33.910
I think that was one of the last shows I ever worked.
I was like,

2029
01:54:34.090 --> 01:54:37.150
this job is just to fucking crazy.
It's too dangerous when,

2030
01:54:37.151 --> 01:54:40.450
when shit goes wild and you see like a whole,
uh,

2031
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:43.180
this whole field filled with people partying,

2032
01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:46.150
they're all fucked up drunk and they're lighting fires.

2033
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:47.710
I mean it was just craziness.

2034
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:50.050
And then people are beating the shit out of each other randomly.

2035
01:54:50.051 --> 01:54:52.630
Like you find like the little packets of people beating the shit out of each

2036
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.680
trawling.
Yeah.
It's per browse just broke out.
And Neil Young concert.

2037
01:54:57.150 --> 01:55:02.110
That's Joseph.
Listen,
everybody in Massachusetts will punch you in the face.

2038
01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.960
Okay.
Be well aware of that.
True.

2039
01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.330
Everybody in Massachusetts that you're in an argument with,

2040
01:55:07.331 --> 01:55:10.020
you have a very good shot of getting punched in the face.
That's just a fact.

2041
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:13.730
<v 7>Man.
Did you see that video of that riot that broke out at the sport?</v>

2042
01:55:13.731 --> 01:55:18.380
The basketball game?
Like an Intel,
a riot broke out in the crowds.

2043
01:55:18.381 --> 01:55:22.370
Like people were not shocked when human stampede,
it's scary.

2044
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:26.580
Happens all the time in Brazil at that soccer matches.
But

2045
01:55:26.730 --> 01:55:28.780
<v 0>that guy,
the referee stabbed,</v>

2046
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.630
they had the referee got in a fight with someone in the,
in the crowd.
Okay.
A Fan,

2047
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:38.610
uh,
tried to stab the referee.
And the referee wound up stabbing the fan,

2048
01:55:38.611 --> 01:55:41.550
or the fan was attacking the referee.
The referee stabbed him and killed him.

2049
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:44.130
Then the audience came down

2050
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:49.080
<v 1>and rip the guy apart,
cut,
decapitated him and removed his limbs.</v>

2051
01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:51.700
<v 2>The ref referee,
Ooh.</v>

2052
01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:54.170
<v 1>The fans murdered the referee and cut his head off.</v>

2053
01:55:54.171 --> 01:55:58.550
And it wasn't just one fan that did this.
It was like 28 people that did this.

2054
01:55:58.790 --> 01:56:02.150
They tore this guy apart and cut his limbs off and cut his head off.
See,

2055
01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:03.290
everything's perfect.

2056
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:10.170
<v 2>Well,
the Buddhists say,
no snowflake ever falls in the wrong place.</v>

2057
01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.310
No snowflake ever

2058
01:56:11.410 --> 01:56:13.150
<v 1>falls on the wrong decapitated.</v>

2059
01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.340
It's all the,
with the university plan.

2060
01:56:18.670 --> 01:56:21.670
Don't go fucking stabbing people and you won't get dismembered in front of a

2061
01:56:21.671 --> 01:56:26.440
large crowd of soccer fans.
Yeah,
I mean the,
uh,
they've arrested a few people,

2062
01:56:26.441 --> 01:56:28.850
but I don't know how that works.
How many people can you try for murder?

2063
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:32.350
Look at this Brazilian soccer referee beheaded by angry fans who put his head on

2064
01:56:32.351 --> 01:56:37.060
a stake after he stabbed a play
old school.

2065
01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:41.640
Wow.
They put his head on a stake and then they'll look,
man,
all those prime,

2066
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:44.080
evil ways of dealing with things,
all of those most

2067
01:56:44.170 --> 01:56:47.220
<v 2>Lacrosse,
you know how lacrosse started?
No,</v>

2068
01:56:47.290 --> 01:56:52.290
it was a substitute for war among the Iroquois and the people who lived in

2069
01:56:52.331 --> 01:56:54.490
northeast us and we're part of Canada.

2070
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:57.550
So what they did was they developed this game and the cross,

2071
01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:00.090
there was no field initially,
there was like a hoop,
you know,

2072
01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:03.460
that they would put it on a steak and one part of the woods and the other one

2073
01:57:03.461 --> 01:57:05.800
and the other part of the woods.
And they had the,
you know,

2074
01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:09.850
the sticks and all that that they would and you would like fuck people up.

2075
01:57:09.851 --> 01:57:14.560
You'd kill people along the way.
You'd like stab people with your stick.
And uh,

2076
01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:18.610
I don't know if this is true in all cases,
but in many cases the,

2077
01:57:18.810 --> 01:57:23.200
the losing team,
whoever was still surviving would then be tortured and killed.

2078
01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.970
So is actually a substitute for war.
Kind of like Chai,
not just go to war.
Well,

2079
01:57:27.971 --> 01:57:31.960
that's what the most,
he's here.
By the way,

2080
01:57:31.961 --> 01:57:36.430
that doesn't sound like a substitute for war.
It's channeling of war.

2081
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:41.620
Well let's think about it when it's warm.
It's women and children.
I kid,
you know?

2082
01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:46.270
Yeah.
And also I mean being tortured among those people.

2083
01:57:46.271 --> 01:57:48.160
When you were talking about the Nez Perce say earlier,

2084
01:57:48.161 --> 01:57:52.240
I was thinking that sounded to me like the people in that part of North America

2085
01:57:52.241 --> 01:57:53.074
and the east,

2086
01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:57.290
cause there was a lot of torturing and eating of uh,

2087
01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:01.690
a victims,
but that was seen as um,
honorable.

2088
01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:02.621
If you were,

2089
01:58:02.621 --> 01:58:06.430
if you were vanquished in battle and captured and eaten and you would be

2090
01:58:06.431 --> 01:58:09.310
tortured and killed the running the gauntlet,
you know,

2091
01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:13.240
that's from those tribes and they would get everybody out there,
old ladies,

2092
01:58:13.241 --> 01:58:13.631
everybody.

2093
01:58:13.631 --> 01:58:17.160
And you'd have to run down through this line and they'd hit you with spikes

2094
01:58:17.161 --> 01:58:21.520
sticks and they just fuck you up as you went down this corridor.

2095
01:58:21.970 --> 01:58:25.000
This,
these are the hunter gatherers.
These,
well,
so they were,

2096
01:58:25.001 --> 01:58:28.180
some were agricultural,
but yeah,
it's the perfect people.

2097
01:58:28.181 --> 01:58:32.450
But he always talks about you guys,
this is good training for me.

2098
01:58:32.890 --> 01:58:37.800
You guys are actually harder to argue with them then academics

2099
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:42.110
don't have any humor.
Humor

2100
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.950
<v 4>is the hardest thing because you look like a fool when people are laughing at</v>

2101
01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:46.870
you.
You're not going to,
what was your point is good or not?
Yeah.

2102
01:58:46.890 --> 01:58:50.510
Sun In Sunday's New York Times I was quoted saying,
uh,

2103
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:55.240
ted is many things and humorless is generally one of them.
Well,
you're right.

2104
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:56.590
Yeah,
I know.
You're right.

2105
01:58:56.591 --> 01:58:59.560
It's unfortunate that it's unfortunate if they would have both.
Yeah.

2106
01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:00.490
What they did to Sarah,

2107
01:59:00.491 --> 01:59:03.520
I think we probably talked about their whole Sarah Silverman thing.
You know,

2108
01:59:03.521 --> 01:59:07.300
they tried it.
They made Eddie Wong stay.
Any wants a fucking famous chef.

2109
01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.730
They made him stay with other people.

2110
01:59:10.130 --> 01:59:13.600
They made them stay like as a college kid and then they trashed and when he left

2111
01:59:13.601 --> 01:59:17.020
to come do your thing,
he's like,
I'm taking an afternoon off.
No,
you can't leave.

2112
01:59:17.021 --> 01:59:18.900
What the fuck are you talking about?
They make you talk.

2113
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:22.070
<v 0>The people,
they make you sleep or they want you to sleep,
but you know,</v>

2114
01:59:22.071 --> 01:59:23.390
they provide awesome content.

2115
01:59:23.391 --> 01:59:26.180
But it's another one of those examples of just because something does something

2116
01:59:26.181 --> 01:59:29.810
awesome doesn't mean it's not inherently fucked as well as being awesome.

2117
01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.300
You know,
Wernher von Braun was a con,

2118
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:37.240
but he was also a brilliant rocket tower con.
He was eventually archive.
I mean,

2119
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:41.210
it's just a part of the world.
There's nothing perfect out there.
You know,

2120
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:43.910
people try,
but so far it's never been achieved.

2121
01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:46.620
<v 4>All right,
let me throw this against the wall and see if it sticks.</v>

2122
01:59:46.890 --> 01:59:51.300
There may be something inherently condition about people who are high achievers.

2123
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:54.030
This did just competitive.
It's just,

2124
01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:56.730
you don't have to be inherently continues to be successful,

2125
01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:00.520
but you don't have to brands way that.
Don't switch it around.
Right.

2126
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:03.520
I'm saying that people who are high achievers,
I,

2127
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:07.110
there's a book called the psychopath test,
uh,
where he,
uh,

2128
02:00:07.170 --> 02:00:10.890
shows a Jon Ronson shows that,
uh,
executives,

2129
02:00:10.891 --> 02:00:15.120
high achieving executives,
bankers,
stockbrokers,
military people,

2130
02:00:15.121 --> 02:00:19.770
politicians,
I'll have a much higher rate of psychopath.
He then normal people,

2131
02:00:20.490 --> 02:00:23.880
right?
So there's something about being a high achiever.

2132
02:00:23.881 --> 02:00:25.650
You're willing to throw people under the bus.

2133
02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:28.470
You're willing to stab people in the back.
You're willing to do what it takes.

2134
02:00:28.471 --> 02:00:31.470
You've got the fire in the belly,
you've got ambition.

2135
02:00:31.710 --> 02:00:35.430
Ambition itself is,
I know,
and I know there are exceptions to this,

2136
02:00:35.431 --> 02:00:40.230
but I think ambition itself is psychologically pathological because you don't

2137
02:00:40.231 --> 02:00:42.750
want to be where you are.
I think you want to get somewhere else.

2138
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:47.690
<v 0>Ambition without honor,
ambition without ethics.
Ambition,
without morals.
Ambition,</v>

2139
02:00:47.691 --> 02:00:51.620
without a code.
That's when you run into problems.
It's not the ambition itself.

2140
02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:56.300
It's the ambition representative in a,
in a form of fuckery.
You know,

2141
02:00:56.301 --> 02:01:00.230
it's represented in cheating.
It's represented in a evil behavior.
There's,

2142
02:01:00.650 --> 02:01:05.650
there's absolutely ethical competition and anything less than ethical

2143
02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:09.150
competition should be dishonorable and should be,
it'd be,

2144
02:01:09.151 --> 02:01:11.750
should be preferable to be poor.
And that's the problem.

2145
02:01:11.751 --> 02:01:14.630
There's a lack of honor and these are lack of a code.

2146
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:18.470
And one of the reasons being is that our society and the rules that have been

2147
02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:23.360
thrust upon us in many ways is so ridiculous that we reject it.
Yeah.

2148
02:01:23.361 --> 02:01:27.620
You shouldn't probably walk across the street and randomly anywhere and Jay walk

2149
02:01:27.621 --> 02:01:28.910
and make people slam on their brakes.

2150
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:32.090
But you shouldn't make me pay money cause I walked across the street.
Why do,

2151
02:01:32.091 --> 02:01:35.390
why do you get money?
Because why?
What does Jay Walking?
What is that?

2152
02:01:35.630 --> 02:01:37.520
There's a lot of those things.
There's a lot of those things.

2153
02:01:37.521 --> 02:01:40.040
Parking tickets and all sorts of stupid

2154
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.430
<v 1>things about like speeding quotas were fundamentally,
yeah,</v>

2155
02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:46.310
you probably shouldn't.
Speed shouldn't put people in danger,

2156
02:01:46.311 --> 02:01:50.870
but who the fuck are you to pull people over and make them write paper?
What?

2157
02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.730
Because we elected someone to be in a position to control the traffic and this

2158
02:01:55.731 --> 02:01:59.360
is your solution.
This is a stupid fucking solution,
man.
This whole thing sucks.

2159
02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:02.090
You guys need to steal money for people every year just to pay your fucking

2160
02:02:02.091 --> 02:02:03.920
salaries.
You're not even funded.

2161
02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.680
You're funded by the fact that people are getting robbed.

2162
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:10.340
You're pulling people over for rolling through a stop sign.
You're a cunt.

2163
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.050
You know the whole thing's cont ish.

2164
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:17.051
You're in a business and that seems fundamentally to be the problem is that we

2165
02:02:17.241 --> 02:02:18.350
don't have codes,

2166
02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:22.730
that we don't have a clear ethical structure for our society that's based on

2167
02:02:22.731 --> 02:02:27.731
being nice to people and raising nice children and stopping abuse at the

2168
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:33.100
fundamental level of childhood and child rearing and making and developing

2169
02:02:33.591 --> 02:02:38.090
shitty human beings that further instigate this problem.
I think.

2170
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:42.350
I think the fellow showed though,
while it is very clear,
it is,
no,
it's not clear,

2171
02:02:42.351 --> 02:02:46.730
but I think ultimately the code is get away with whatever you can get away with.

2172
02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.330
But that's not true because there's many people that are very happy because of

2173
02:02:50.331 --> 02:02:53.690
it succeeded in life without doing that.
Okay.
We celebrate,
uh,

2174
02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:57.650
I don't remember which coach it was who said,
uh,
winning's not the biggest thing.

2175
02:02:57.651 --> 02:02:58.640
It's the only thing.

2176
02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:02.870
That's what you say when you're trying to motivate players.

2177
02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:05.320
It doesn't mean that that's what people really funny.

2178
02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:09.140
Have you seen that Alan Watts animation,
the South Park animation,

2179
02:03:09.141 --> 02:03:10.220
if you seen that,
some of them,

2180
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:13.490
have you ever seen the Alan Watts South Park animation?
Can we play that?

2181
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:16.730
You know that I'm talking about.
I can find it for you.
I'll find it.
It's so good.

2182
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:17.540
There are a bunch of them.

2183
02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:21.590
There's one that I'll find this totally related to this.
Hold on people.
Go ahead.

2184
02:03:21.591 --> 02:03:25.760
Duncan.
People celebrate.
People that have a code.

2185
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:30.830
The code is not celebrated,
but on a social level,
on a social look,

2186
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:35.150
I mean,
look at it's the most money.
Who gets the most ethical people,

2187
02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:37.520
but we don't celebrate that in its entirety.

2188
02:03:37.521 --> 02:03:40.160
We don't celebrate and making the most money at all costs.

2189
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.770
We don't celebrate what we do.
Sell those people.
No,

2190
02:03:42.771 --> 02:03:46.210
we do celebrate it by giving them the money.
That's the point.
That's a stretch.

2191
02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.640
Celebrating down on those people.
We get angry.
They don't give a fuck.

2192
02:03:49.641 --> 02:03:52.580
What do I see?
That's where we disagree.

2193
02:03:52.581 --> 02:03:56.630
I think every person who's not completely out of their fucking mind thinks about

2194
02:03:56.631 --> 02:03:57.900
what other people think about that.
All right.

2195
02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:00.980
Then we're back to money being toxic,
but I'm just saying on a honest,

2196
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.520
not necessarily money being toxic.
Simplification.

2197
02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:06.010
I think you are slow.

2198
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:10.610
That's all I'm trying to say is as a on a social level,

2199
02:04:10.670 --> 02:04:11.690
social construct,

2200
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.960
our the re most resources go to those who win at whatever their,

2201
02:04:17.081 --> 02:04:20.960
their thing is best if they're in banking and finance because that's where more

2202
02:04:20.961 --> 02:04:25.460
money is going these days and not if they do it unethically.

2203
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:30.550
Ethic the the society rewards winning.

2204
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:34.670
We talk about politicians who have the fire in the belly,
who have the ambition,

2205
02:04:34.671 --> 02:04:38.190
who have the need to be leaders and so on.
Those are not healthy people

2206
02:04:38.290 --> 02:04:41.130
<v 4>and the people who should be our leaders are the people who aren't interested in</v>

2207
02:04:41.131 --> 02:04:42.440
being earlier.
Yes,
I agree with you.

2208
02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:47.370
There's a structural distortion in our society that celebrates something that on

2209
02:04:47.371 --> 02:04:49.240
an ethical level we don't agree.

2210
02:04:49.241 --> 02:04:51.720
You can I show you guys this thing cause it really sounds like what you're

2211
02:04:51.721 --> 02:04:53.070
talking about.
Sure.
Play that video.

2212
02:04:53.071 --> 02:04:56.520
It's so good to south park people animated all of these Alan Watts things.

2213
02:04:56.521 --> 02:05:00.680
It's so good.
We don't hear any

2214
02:05:00.710 --> 02:05:05.060
<v 10>in music.
One doesn't make the end of the composition.</v>

2215
02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:07.670
The point of the composition.
Yes.

2216
02:05:07.671 --> 02:05:11.480
That was so the best conductors would have

2217
02:05:13.190 --> 02:05:15.680
there would be composed of different it

2218
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:20.950
people go to conference,
just the other one crashing.
Because

2219
02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:28.660
what we don't see that as something brought by our education into our everyday

2220
02:05:30.441 --> 02:05:31.274
conduct,

2221
02:05:31.670 --> 02:05:35.750
we've got a system of schooling just gives a completely different impression.

2222
02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:37.813
It's all graded.

2223
02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:43.170
And what we do is we put the child into the car door of this rain system with a

2224
02:05:43.171 --> 02:05:46.640
kind of calmer,
kidding,
kidding,
kidding.
Um,
yeah,
you're going to kindergarten.

2225
02:05:46.641 --> 02:05:49.600
You know,
and that's the great thing because when you finish that,

2226
02:05:49.610 --> 02:05:52.880
you'll get into first grade and then come on in.

2227
02:05:52.881 --> 02:05:55.850
First grade is the second grade and so on.
And then you get out of grade school,

2228
02:05:55.851 --> 02:05:58.710
you've got high school and it's revving up.
The thing is coming.

2229
02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.270
Then you've got to go to college by Jovan.

2230
02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:04.530
You get into graduate school and when you're through with graduate school,

2231
02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:09.440
you go out and join your world and then you get into some racket when you're

2232
02:06:09.441 --> 02:06:13.880
selling insurance and they've got that corner to mate and you're going to make

2233
02:06:13.881 --> 02:06:17.660
that.
And all the time this thing is coming,
it's coming.
It's coming.

2234
02:06:17.661 --> 02:06:20.480
That great thing.
That's success feel wasn't from then.

2235
02:06:20.481 --> 02:06:24.590
When you wake up one day about 40 years old,
you say,
my God,
I've arrived.

2236
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:26.633
I'm there.

2237
02:06:27.630 --> 02:06:31.340
And you don't feel very different from what you want with felt and was a slight

2238
02:06:31.341 --> 02:06:34.760
let down because you feel as a home and there was a hoax,

2239
02:06:35.410 --> 02:06:37.730
a dreadful hugs.
They made you miss everything.

2240
02:06:38.690 --> 02:06:43.190
Because we thought of life by analogy with a journey with a pilgrimage.

2241
02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:43.850
We tried to,

2242
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:47.930
serious purpose at the end of the thing was to get to that end success or

2243
02:06:47.931 --> 02:06:50.390
whatever it is,
or maybe Evan after you're dead.

2244
02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:53.450
But we miss the point the whole way along.

2245
02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:58.070
It was a musical thing and it was supposed to sing or to dance while the music

2246
02:06:58.071 --> 02:06:58.904
was being safe.

2247
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.990
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

2248
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:04.900
<v 4>Live your life pitches.
Yeah.
Alan Watts is a bad motherfucker.
Yes,
he was,</v>

2249
02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:08.330
man.
Yeah,
totally.
You know,
so that's the ambition that you're talking about.

2250
02:07:08.331 --> 02:07:11.420
It's like when people are always rushing and rushing at trying to get to the

2251
02:07:11.421 --> 02:07:14.690
lack of balance.
Yeah.
You know,

2252
02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:17.510
when we were talking about the bankers and the people that are handling the
mind,

2253
02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:20.830
what percentage of our population is actually bankers versus what percentage of

2254
02:07:20.831 --> 02:07:24.830
our population is actually ambitious versus what percentage of the resources of

2255
02:07:24.831 --> 02:07:27.550
our society go to those people?
We have a corrupt system.

2256
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:30.380
This is a corrupt system and once people are in power,

2257
02:07:30.381 --> 02:07:34.430
they're very reluctant to give away any of that power and so they keep lobbying

2258
02:07:34.431 --> 02:07:36.220
and bribing essentially

2259
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:37.620
<v 1>see to keep the laws of that.</v>

2260
02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:38.631
<v 2>Yeah,
exactly.</v>

2261
02:07:38.631 --> 02:07:43.190
The reason I'm arguing so vociferously about this is that I think that you're

2262
02:07:43.191 --> 02:07:45.740
right,
it's not clear because we've got a two track system.

2263
02:07:45.741 --> 02:07:50.240
We've got a an ethical system that tells kids be nice to each other,
you know,

2264
02:07:50.241 --> 02:07:52.400
blah,
blah,
blah.
The golden rule,

2265
02:07:52.670 --> 02:07:57.670
but the structure underlying the fundamentals of our society are sending the

2266
02:07:58.311 --> 02:08:03.050
opposites,
a message there saying,
fuck everybody,
I get yours.

2267
02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:04.113
<v 1>I think they are though,</v>

2268
02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:07.780
but I'm saying this is why it's a symbol vacation because we obviously have

2269
02:08:07.781 --> 02:08:09.910
rules in place to keep people from stealing.

2270
02:08:09.911 --> 02:08:11.560
We obviously have rules in place to protect,

2271
02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:15.710
<v 2>but as Duncan said,
not if they're inside the system.
That's the point.</v>

2272
02:08:15.711 --> 02:08:17.540
If you steal a hundred million dollars,

2273
02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:21.660
nobody went to jail for what happened in Wall Street.
Nobody.

2274
02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:24.800
All those banks you talked about in Miami laundering,
drug money,

2275
02:08:24.801 --> 02:08:28.340
they've been doing it for decades.
Hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

2276
02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:31.190
Nobody's ever gone to jail for that.

2277
02:08:31.530 --> 02:08:34.830
<v 1>Right?
But that's not out in the public.
And that's not out in the open.</v>

2278
02:08:34.831 --> 02:08:37.740
What's out in the public and what's out in the open is what's,
you know,

2279
02:08:37.741 --> 02:08:40.020
what we hear about in the news and what,
you know,

2280
02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:43.980
<v 2>it's the poor people getting hauled away.
The skinny guy in handcuffs.</v>

2281
02:08:43.981 --> 02:08:48.360
So what I'm saying is there's this fundamental hypocrisy at the heart of

2282
02:08:48.361 --> 02:08:50.610
American society and many other societies,

2283
02:08:50.611 --> 02:08:55.170
but particularly in American society where the ethical message is in direct

2284
02:08:55.171 --> 02:08:59.940
contradiction with the fundamental values of the way the society is structured.

2285
02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:01.120
I see what you're saying.

2286
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:06.120
<v 1>And about corruption being because of human ambition and that human ambition</v>

2287
02:09:06.561 --> 02:09:09.650
when it gets into position in Japan,
positions of power,
ultimate power,

2288
02:09:09.651 --> 02:09:13.220
corrupting ultimately that there's almost no way to avoid it.

2289
02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:16.640
That maybe it's just that human beings should never be in that kind of a

2290
02:09:16.641 --> 02:09:17.480
position of power.

2291
02:09:17.690 --> 02:09:22.430
Maybe something like a corporation where you can go outside of the laws of human

2292
02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:24.350
one on one interaction,

2293
02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:27.230
maybe something like that just really should have never been allowed to take

2294
02:09:27.231 --> 02:09:30.440
place because as soon as you allow people to have groups and those groups to

2295
02:09:30.441 --> 02:09:34.460
have massive influence and then the dem to benefit personally from that massive

2296
02:09:34.461 --> 02:09:35.240
influence,

2297
02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:39.140
the decisions that they make affect so many people and they're so gigantic,

2298
02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:43.370
they're almost anti human and that's essentially what people always accuse

2299
02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:45.350
corporations of being anti human.

2300
02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.670
It's because they've become a part unwittingly of a much larger organism that

2301
02:09:49.671 --> 02:09:52.310
needs people to live off of but isn't a person

2302
02:09:52.450 --> 02:09:55.960
<v 2>and it's whose interests don't align with those of human beings.</v>

2303
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.790
<v 1>It's,
yeah,
so it's not even like humans.</v>

2304
02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:01.920
Human ambition is what a problem is.
The problem is,

2305
02:10:01.921 --> 02:10:04.490
is when it gets funneled into these giant groups,

2306
02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:07.220
because one person on their own,
it doesn't really have that much power.

2307
02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:09.710
This is the of the power that they can physically,
you know,

2308
02:10:09.711 --> 02:10:12.720
do whatever they can do with people around them.
But most of the time,

2309
02:10:12.721 --> 02:10:16.160
and you know,
you're fucking around.
You're one person and you,
you know,

2310
02:10:16.161 --> 02:10:18.560
you're subjugating a bunch of different people.
They all attack you,

2311
02:10:18.561 --> 02:10:22.190
they'll go after you.
But the problem is when they,
when things become so big,

2312
02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:23.400
they can no longer be attached

2313
02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:26.530
<v 2>and shame is no longer an effective form of controlling.</v>

2314
02:10:26.531 --> 02:10:28.020
It doesn't mean anything.
Like,
Hey,

2315
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:32.900
I don't give a shit if I'm like destroying the Amazon with my oil wells,
uh,

2316
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.190
because my friends like me

2317
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:37.320
<v 1>[inaudible] because I throw good parties and I take them out of my,
I'll do it.</v>

2318
02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.850
We're all doing it.
Everyone's doing it.
I'm destroying the Amazon.

2319
02:10:39.851 --> 02:10:40.541
You're just trying to mean we,

2320
02:10:40.541 --> 02:10:43.780
we'd all be together in it and we'd sort of justify it in some sort of a way.

2321
02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:46.030
Yeah.
There's the locust.
The rule was on,

2322
02:10:46.031 --> 02:10:49.420
he was talking about Fred Phelps and that,
that crazy Baptist church,

2323
02:10:49.421 --> 02:10:50.580
Westboro Baptist church with,

2324
02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:54.160
he spent three weeks with the guy and he said that one of the weirdest aspects

2325
02:10:54.161 --> 02:10:56.020
of his trip was that after three weeks,

2326
02:10:56.170 --> 02:10:58.390
although it didn't change his views of the world,

2327
02:10:58.400 --> 02:10:59.980
he thought all the things you were saying,
you know,

2328
02:10:59.981 --> 02:11:03.610
God hates fags and all that was very horrific.
It became normal and commonplace.

2329
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:08.290
It became like the impact of it was less because he had been around it for so

2330
02:11:08.291 --> 02:11:12.310
long that he had been sort of acclimated to it and he thinks it's one of the

2331
02:11:12.311 --> 02:11:16.720
ways that these people get away in their own mind with doing this and sort of

2332
02:11:16.721 --> 02:11:20.080
connecting it to the idea that this is God's word is because they just get so

2333
02:11:20.081 --> 02:11:22.630
accustomed to it.
They get acclimated to madness.

2334
02:11:23.410 --> 02:11:25.390
<v 2>Do you guys,
do we all right,</v>

2335
02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:30.640
<v 7>so you don't get to decide what you want to harmonize with and if you're like</v>

2336
02:11:30.641 --> 02:11:32.350
you,
that's,
that's what I'm saying.

2337
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:35.400
<v 1>You get a little bit,
a little bit if you can,
if you can,</v>

2338
02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:39.450
but if you're a child or if you're raised in a terrible fucking place where you

2339
02:11:39.451 --> 02:11:42.810
can't get out and you're stuck there as an adult books man books are the

2340
02:11:42.811 --> 02:11:45.270
greatest training if they exist,
if they exist,

2341
02:11:45.271 --> 02:11:47.790
but then it brings back to the Internet because that's what I always say is the

2342
02:11:47.791 --> 02:11:51.090
great savior of the human being because the Internet connects all the ideas

2343
02:11:51.091 --> 02:11:53.130
together to everyone everywhere,
whenever it's available

2344
02:11:53.290 --> 02:11:56.710
<v 7>and you have to,
but you have to decide what you're going to look for.</v>

2345
02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.220
That's the main thing.
What are your,
what are you mining for?

2346
02:12:00.221 --> 02:12:01.810
If you're mining for demons,

2347
02:12:02.050 --> 02:12:05.980
there's a part of this mine that's filled with fucking demons but you can

2348
02:12:06.190 --> 02:12:10.090
harmonize.
That's the thing you can tune in for sure.
And there are,

2349
02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:13.630
there are lots of different ways to do that.
You know it isn't hopeless.

2350
02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:17.080
Does is that joke?
I've,
I've,
I've actually given up the joke cause I haven't,

2351
02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.030
I can't make it funny but I've been saying it,

2352
02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:24.480
being in the United States is like being a cell in the body of a very healthy

2353
02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:30.050
serial killer,
you know,
and it's like so,
so,
so the,

2354
02:12:30.210 --> 02:12:35.210
the the thing to do is not to try to destroy the organism or try to like you're

2355
02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:39.250
not going to be able to fight against an entire thing.
It's to fix yourself.

2356
02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:41.890
That's what it is.
Fix Yourself.
That's okay.

2357
02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:46.980
<v 2>Did you fix yourself then you become the cancer cell because you're disruptive</v>

2358
02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:51.550
to the dominant,
the logic of the,
of your host,
right?

2359
02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:55.940
<v 7>Yeah,
I,
but I hopefully it's not hopefully like the idea is like if you know,</v>

2360
02:12:55.950 --> 02:13:00.090
you get one really fucking happy person and that happy person is going to change

2361
02:13:00.091 --> 02:13:01.140
the people around them.

2362
02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.240
<v 2>Well that none did you hear about this nun who just went to prison?</v>

2363
02:13:04.241 --> 02:13:06.790
She's like in her eighties in Pennsylvania,

2364
02:13:06.791 --> 02:13:10.900
she was one of these nuns who broke into a,
some top secret,

2365
02:13:10.901 --> 02:13:14.470
a defense lab in Pennsylvania or Maryland.

2366
02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:17.600
They went in at night and nobody caught them.
And they like when are,

2367
02:13:17.601 --> 02:13:18.580
they didn't hurt anything,

2368
02:13:18.581 --> 02:13:23.581
but they were demonstrating how unsecure the information there was and how easy

2369
02:13:24.221 --> 02:13:27.640
it would be.
And they,
they stay there peacefully and got arrested.

2370
02:13:27.641 --> 02:13:32.100
I think it was a non in two priests and uh,
she just went to prison.

2371
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.840
<v 7>I mean,
she became,
you know,</v>

2372
02:13:33.870 --> 02:13:37.610
disruptive to look at Snowden for is another example.
Sure.

2373
02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:41.480
Let Bradley Manning or you know,
Snowden manning and snowed.

2374
02:13:41.490 --> 02:13:45.360
Like if you look at that,
they tuned into a higher frequency,

2375
02:13:45.361 --> 02:13:49.080
which is the frequency of justice,
of truth of what's right.

2376
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:51.270
A higher ethic tuned into that.

2377
02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.150
Any key sacrificed everything for it.

2378
02:13:54.151 --> 02:13:56.940
Now he's a hero and he's created change.

2379
02:13:57.150 --> 02:14:01.110
Big Time change in that body of the serial killer.
It is that you didn't fix it,

2380
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:03.180
but God dammit,
that's not going away.

2381
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:05.700
People aren't forgetting the fact that they're being monitored.

2382
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.550
That didn't go anywhere.
That's constantly going to be,
uh,
that,
that's,
that's the,

2383
02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:13.950
that would be an example of a serial killer having something go from the

2384
02:14:13.951 --> 02:14:18.120
subconscious to the conscious,
you know,
or suddenly the serial killer is like,
ah,

2385
02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.540
it's a kidney stone hearing shit.
I'm,

2386
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:25.470
I'm killing people every day.
I don't know if this is really good.

2387
02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:30.330
It created a little bit of indigestion and society,
you know,

2388
02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:35.300
and,
and one person did that.
That's one person doing what he thinks,
right?
Yeah.

2389
02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:38.760
So what happens if we get five of those people and then what happens if you get

2390
02:14:38.761 --> 02:14:39.960
20 of those people?

2391
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.040
The change can be so drastic and radical that it would make your heads

2392
02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:47.490
<v 1>well,
I think he's going to be looked at in the future.
It's a revolutionary.
Yeah.</v>

2393
02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.020
Yeah.
That'd be looked at as a guy who sacrifices on safety to save the culture.

2394
02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:52.310
And you know,

2395
02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:55.730
when you see that guy do that video conference from south by southwest and these

2396
02:14:55.731 --> 02:14:57.650
giant standing ovation,
whatever,

2397
02:14:57.710 --> 02:15:00.590
what other person who's being shielded by another country,

2398
02:15:00.591 --> 02:15:04.030
a country that we always think of as evil gets treated like that.
Right.

2399
02:15:04.070 --> 02:15:07.850
What other criminal that's running from the long arm of the government.

2400
02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:11.810
He's hiding literally.
He's caused himself like a large house cat.

2401
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:14.780
That's what he says.
He's like,
here's the life of a domestic house cat,

2402
02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:18.470
because he doesn't go outside.
Wow.
Just lives inside the house.
I mean,

2403
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:22.400
if he didn't go outside it would be Russia,
which also sucks.
It sucks.

2404
02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:27.230
And he's probably on some giant list of death wishes.
I mean,

2405
02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:29.480
people who they want dead,
you know,
stupid.

2406
02:15:29.530 --> 02:15:32.990
The wiki leaks guys is as fucked up as he is.

2407
02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:34.940
Well,

2408
02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:39.890
he's apparently a real asshole and very egotistical and manipulative and

2409
02:15:39.891 --> 02:15:44.150
narcissistic and I would reserve judgment until I met him.
I really would.
I just,

2410
02:15:44.151 --> 02:15:47.630
I think I can imagine how much character assassination has been doctored up

2411
02:15:47.631 --> 02:15:51.260
about that guy.
So you're going to come up with one guy to character assassinate.

2412
02:15:51.261 --> 02:15:54.800
It would be Julian Assange.
He looks like a Douche bag.
He's got silver hair.

2413
02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.540
There's videos of him dancing.
It's so easy to just say,
that guy's a con,

2414
02:15:59.810 --> 02:16:00.643
but I don't know that.
Right.

2415
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:05.100
<v 7>God forbid any video of me.
Seriously,
dancing emerges on the fucking internet</v>

2416
02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:09.500
<v 1>easily take a point of view of either one of us,</v>

2417
02:16:09.501 --> 02:16:13.250
especially if they had a stuck in a house somewhere that you were a total piece

2418
02:16:13.251 --> 02:16:17.390
of shit because you become some gigantic controversial figure and you might have

2419
02:16:17.391 --> 02:16:20.990
jeopardized American safety by releasing military secrets.

2420
02:16:20.991 --> 02:16:24.230
And there's so many variables there that it's so easy to label you a con.

2421
02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:27.560
Plus you'll look like a cunt,
you know,
he looks like a con.

2422
02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:30.070
It's fucking silvery and his fucking

2423
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.530
<v 3>posh accent.
Fuck that guy.
That's everybody thinks,</v>

2424
02:16:32.770 --> 02:16:34.950
and then you hear all this crazy shit about him,
you know,

2425
02:16:35.410 --> 02:16:40.300
being creepy to women and Oh,
I saw that common.
Yeah.
Well that,

2426
02:16:40.301 --> 02:16:43.240
that's definitely a set up,
that whole rape thing.
I mean,
well,

2427
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:46.780
it's certainly a really transparent way to try to get him out of the country.

2428
02:16:46.781 --> 02:16:48.730
I mean,
that's the most transparent shit ever.
Oh,

2429
02:16:48.731 --> 02:16:51.040
you're not worried about the wiki leaks thing you worried about he might have

2430
02:16:51.041 --> 02:16:52.360
had sex with someone.
Yeah.

2431
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:57.100
Someone who actually invited him over for another night after the event.

2432
02:16:57.550 --> 02:17:00.010
And what she was pissed off about.
It wasn't that he fucked her,

2433
02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:02.230
it's that he fucked her without a condom in the middle of the,

2434
02:17:02.231 --> 02:17:05.380
there were lying naked in bed.
Right.
He got a boner.
He stuck her.

2435
02:17:05.381 --> 02:17:09.040
Then she got mad.
Come on.
Even if she did get mad,
which by the way,

2436
02:17:09.041 --> 02:17:10.450
she does have every right to get mad.

2437
02:17:10.450 --> 02:17:12.160
How'd that become an international incident?

2438
02:17:12.370 --> 02:17:14.950
How was that something where you're fucking locking some guy up?
Right,
right,

2439
02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:15.190
right.

2440
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:18.970
What kind of a balance does that show when you look at what people are getting

2441
02:17:18.971 --> 02:17:20.890
arrested for and not getting arrested for?
Yeah,

2442
02:17:20.891 --> 02:17:22.520
that's a shit head thing to do in that guy.

2443
02:17:22.570 --> 02:17:24.250
That girl shouldn't hang out with that guy anymore.

2444
02:17:24.490 --> 02:17:26.170
But if you did go out with them again afterwards,

2445
02:17:26.171 --> 02:17:27.670
well people are allowed to make mistakes,

2446
02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:31.480
but you're not allowed to lock that guy up in a fucking house for a year and

2447
02:17:31.481 --> 02:17:34.600
have armies waiting with loaded guns,
standing outside.

2448
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:38.590
Take his fucking head off before he can testify.
Yeah,
that's it man.
That's,

2449
02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.980
that's the thing you,
it's creepy when you think about the trajectory,

2450
02:17:41.981 --> 02:17:43.570
cause I remember they were talking about,
yeah.
Okay,

2451
02:17:43.571 --> 02:17:45.820
well what if he does go back to stand trial?

2452
02:17:45.821 --> 02:17:49.430
Is there a possibility that there an extradition policy where they could put

2453
02:17:49.431 --> 02:17:50.650
them back in the United States and like,

2454
02:17:50.651 --> 02:17:53.830
well yeah they do have an extradition policy and then it's like,
okay so wait,

2455
02:17:53.831 --> 02:17:55.900
there's an extradition policy.
It goes the United States.

2456
02:17:55.901 --> 02:18:00.640
Is there any potential he could be executed for what he did and like,
wow.
Yeah,

2457
02:18:00.641 --> 02:18:04.180
it's trees.
It's a little unlikely.
But yes,
he could be executed.

2458
02:18:04.210 --> 02:18:08.860
He will no doubt be arrested and jailed forever and probably killed in jail

2459
02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:13.090
before he even gets to try and maybe it'll be stuck mandolin manning style in

2460
02:18:13.091 --> 02:18:17.530
solitary,
Simon and naked in a cold cell.
We will barely stay alive.

2461
02:18:18.570 --> 02:18:20.200
Like I was telling you,
I did.

2462
02:18:20.201 --> 02:18:24.130
You know about that fucking chemical waterboarding just being given fucking

2463
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:27.280
Larry him read my friend's book,
the answer to the riddle as me,
it's great.

2464
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:30.920
Got Amnesia and fucking India,
but that's variable.

2465
02:18:30.930 --> 02:18:35.800
But explain to people people don't know delirium is,
well,
Larry is a,
yeah,
it's a,

2466
02:18:35.801 --> 02:18:40.801
it's a anti-malaria drug that it's for a small percentage of people who take it,

2467
02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:46.120
it can accumulate in your brain.
And then suddenly my,
my friend's book,
uh,

2468
02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.360
he describes it as putting your thumb on top of a hose and you're on one of your

2469
02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:56.590
neurons.
I'm sure I'm saying it wrong,
but it's like basically all your,

2470
02:18:56.710 --> 02:18:59.230
I'm going to say it my own way,
the dumb way.

2471
02:18:59.350 --> 02:19:03.010
It's like your brain juice goes spraying all in the wrong places and then you

2472
02:19:03.011 --> 02:19:05.920
end up completely losing your fucking mind.

2473
02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:10.020
My friend forgot who he was,
had no idea who he was.
Uh,

2474
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:13.360
he lost all of his memories,

2475
02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:16.810
had to be reminded of what his life was,
had to go through.

2476
02:19:16.811 --> 02:19:20.350
All his pictures is all in this fucking great book.
And I do want to plug it,

2477
02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:21.490
cause he's one of my best friends.

2478
02:19:21.491 --> 02:19:24.310
The answer to the riddle is me so fucking good.

2479
02:19:24.430 --> 02:19:28.100
But in this book he talks about the history of Larry Him and then he talks

2480
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.020
<v 7>about how it,
God Damn Guantanamo Bay,</v>

2481
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:34.490
they're giving this drug to people who they know that they know causes Amnesia

2482
02:19:34.491 --> 02:19:35.271
and insanity.

2483
02:19:35.271 --> 02:19:40.271
They're giving it to people in Guantanamo Bay in massive doses and apparently

2484
02:19:40.281 --> 02:19:42.320
there's no malaria there.
There's no,

2485
02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:44.510
there's no mosquitoes that cause malaria there,

2486
02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:48.560
so why the fuck are they giving these people this drug?
It's sinister man.

2487
02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:51.040
<v 1>So they're giving them the drug just to erase your memory.</v>

2488
02:19:51.430 --> 02:19:55.060
It's essentially like their version of what the aliens do to you after they

2489
02:19:55.061 --> 02:19:55.720
check your butt.

2490
02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:59.320
<v 7>Yeah,
exactly.
They're wiping their just fucking were there.</v>

2491
02:19:59.321 --> 02:20:01.660
They're fucking with their brains.
It's a psychedelic.

2492
02:20:01.661 --> 02:20:03.610
When your brain malfunctions on Larry Laurium,

2493
02:20:03.850 --> 02:20:06.460
it's basically like you're on acid for a couple of months.

2494
02:20:06.461 --> 02:20:08.890
Like you don't just lose your memory walls.

2495
02:20:08.891 --> 02:20:13.891
Binned there's a suicide note that in his book of a guy who was just talking

2496
02:20:14.831 --> 02:20:18.220
about how it's been like three years and he's still exactly as fucked up as he

2497
02:20:18.221 --> 02:20:21.730
was when he started taking Laurium.
It's the,
it's a note to his family,

2498
02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:24.880
but the point is that's the guy who was never charged with a crime,
by the way.

2499
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:29.410
Right,
exactly.
That's what I'm saying.
So fucking a Sanje comes back here.

2500
02:20:29.411 --> 02:20:30.760
It's not just like they're going to lock him up.

2501
02:20:30.761 --> 02:20:34.000
It's like they're going to be injecting all kinds of weird shit into his body.

2502
02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:37.850
They're going to be filling in with weird chemicals.
That's spooky,
man.

2503
02:20:37.930 --> 02:20:38.830
<v 1>It's very spooky.</v>

2504
02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:42.250
It's very spooky and it's very strange how many people don't see it that way.

2505
02:20:42.390 --> 02:20:45.580
Yeah.
How many people see will live there?
Everybody.
Dude,
the new gig.

2506
02:20:45.581 --> 02:20:48.640
Would you nudge dude secrets?
What is the United States?

2507
02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:51.880
It's a collection of humans and at the very top of that collection,

2508
02:20:51.881 --> 02:20:55.390
what exactly are they doing?
They're doing what?
They're doing this.

2509
02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:58.120
They're shooting missiles at fucking minivans filled with kids.

2510
02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:01.600
They're working for corporation.
What are they doing?
They're extracting money.

2511
02:21:02.170 --> 02:21:04.210
National interest.
Speaking of books,

2512
02:21:04.211 --> 02:21:08.080
did you and Louie thorough talk about his dad at all?
No.
You know who his dad is?

2513
02:21:08.490 --> 02:21:10.630
No.
His Dad's a really well known writer.

2514
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:15.220
Bill is probably the most famous travel writer in the world.
Paul Theroux,

2515
02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:19.890
he wrote the mosquito coast.
Great movie.
Harrison Ford's.
Great kidding.
No,

2516
02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:22.390
I don't think he brought that up.
It was a great conversation though.

2517
02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:25.410
He was really fast.
Anything I watched like the first half of it.
He's great.

2518
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.800
He's such a cool guy.
Very,
very funny guy.
He thinks I'm going to call it though.

2519
02:21:29.801 --> 02:21:33.160
He thinks I've started to call.
He,
I could tell he was examining me.

2520
02:21:33.250 --> 02:21:36.460
Is He based in La and he is now.
Yeah.

2521
02:21:36.461 --> 02:21:39.790
But you know the way he does his,
his,
his shows,

2522
02:21:39.850 --> 02:21:43.120
you could tell you looks for like cult everywhere.
He looks for like,

2523
02:21:43.121 --> 02:21:46.750
did you tell him to shut Patchouli are Americans.
I stopped telling him that.

2524
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:50.320
Told him a couple of times.
Everybody has shaved their head.
Well,

2525
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:54.400
he's felt a bit weird now he's got the Jesus beard broke out the beard on the

2526
02:21:54.401 --> 02:21:57.340
website.
It was the first time you ever did it.
It was on the podcast.

2527
02:21:57.341 --> 02:21:59.410
First Time you ever showed the beard.
I was very proud of that.

2528
02:22:00.310 --> 02:22:04.330
So what about this LSD tainted meat in a Walmart,

2529
02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:09.610
<v 7>Jackson,
Lsd,
and don't read it.
They said and write it.
I don't,
I didn't exist.</v>

2530
02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:13.270
Someone you know,
I don't know.
I didn't examine this.
They said the LSD,

2531
02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:17.200
if you cooked it in meat it wouldn't.
It wouldn't last.

2532
02:22:17.201 --> 02:22:19.450
It's a very delicate chemical and point.

2533
02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:23.650
<v 1>I've heard that also about the French.
A case where the CIA dosed a,</v>

2534
02:22:23.651 --> 02:22:27.030
all these people's bread is there was supposedly a,

2535
02:22:27.031 --> 02:22:31.810
an experiment that the French,
a French town that the CIA dosed and entire today,

2536
02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:38.120
I suspect that that story might be a mixture.

2537
02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:42.510
St Elmo.
Saint Saint Vieta says fire,
I think it's called.

2538
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:47.520
There's this story about the witch hunts and some anthropologists went back and

2539
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:52.521
looked at towns that had a the most sort of a crazy witch hunts in the medieval

2540
02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:57.630
period and he found that the years,
the year previous to that,

2541
02:22:57.631 --> 02:23:02.220
there had been an unusually high level of a rain and so air God,

2542
02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:07.280
which is a fungus that grows on rye and wheat and some other grains had grown a

2543
02:23:07.501 --> 02:23:12.300
lot more in air,
got also contains LSD.
Think it's actually a late frost.

2544
02:23:12.301 --> 02:23:16.560
But I think you're right.
I think it was late Friday.
That's the issue.

2545
02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:20.330
But this was always in the bread.
Yeah.
This was not that case though.
This was,

2546
02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:21.540
this is something that different,

2547
02:23:21.541 --> 02:23:24.420
that's one of the things that they used with the Salem witch trials.

2548
02:23:24.421 --> 02:23:27.180
The Salem witch trials they blamed on air.
Got a really,

2549
02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:31.050
they think that when all these people were freaking out about being hacked,

2550
02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:32.580
and that's probably what was going on in there.
Probably.

2551
02:23:32.581 --> 02:23:35.220
I'm really intense psychedelic experience.
Uh,
experiences.

2552
02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:39.870
A 50 year old mystery of the curse bread have a point.
Sate Esprit,

2553
02:23:39.871 --> 02:23:43.500
which left residents suffering who's nations has been solved after a writer

2554
02:23:43.501 --> 02:23:48.210
discovered the u s had spiked the bread with Lsd as part of an experiment.
Ooh,

2555
02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:52.890
1951 at quiet picturesque village in southern France was suddenly mysteriously

2556
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:57.060
struck down with mass insanity and hallucinations.
At least five people died.

2557
02:23:57.090 --> 02:24:01.680
Dozens were interned in asylums and hundreds afflicted for decades.

2558
02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:04.920
It was assumed that the local bread had been unwittingly poisoned with a

2559
02:24:04.921 --> 02:24:07.260
psychedelic mold.
But now,
however,

2560
02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:10.410
an American investigative journalist has uncovered evidence suggesting that the

2561
02:24:10.411 --> 02:24:13.230
CIA peppered local food with a hallucinogenic drugs.

2562
02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:17.430
LSD As a party of a mind control experiment.
At the height of the Cold War.

2563
02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:22.110
He'd been,
I dunno what the references this is cause this isn't the Telegraph,

2564
02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:25.170
the Telegraph,
like the daily mail or is it more legit?

2565
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:29.610
I think it's in between clubs.
Not The Guardian.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2566
02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.540
Well they have all these scientists,

2567
02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:35.790
but they definitely were fucking around with Lsd cointelpro thing.

2568
02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:36.570
Oh they did that with,

2569
02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:40.290
there's plenty of videos where they did that with the soldiers and that's also

2570
02:24:40.291 --> 02:24:43.470
what the Harvard Lsd Studies.
It was what created the Unabomber.

2571
02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:46.440
The Unabomber was a part of the Harvard Lsd Studies.

2572
02:24:46.441 --> 02:24:50.550
And when they did him after he got dosed up,
he kept,
became a fucking nut.

2573
02:24:50.770 --> 02:24:51.900
And that's what happened with him.

2574
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:57.030
Ted Kaczynski Kosinski was in the Harvard LSD studies and that's one of the

2575
02:24:57.031 --> 02:25:00.390
things they tried.
There's a documentary on it called the net and a,

2576
02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:02.850
it's about that very,
that very situation.

2577
02:25:02.851 --> 02:25:05.850
And Ted Kaczynski being a part of the Harvard LSD studies and they don't know

2578
02:25:05.851 --> 02:25:09.000
what the fuck they did to those kids.
They dose the shit out of those kids.

2579
02:25:09.001 --> 02:25:10.920
And he went from there to become a professor,

2580
02:25:10.921 --> 02:25:15.270
a saved up all of his money from school just to be able to buy this cabin in the

2581
02:25:15.271 --> 02:25:19.140
woods,
live there and plot the demise of technology.
Yeah,

2582
02:25:19.141 --> 02:25:21.180
he became a fucking complete nutter.
I mean,

2583
02:25:21.181 --> 02:25:24.190
whether or not it was in neither before that,
who knows.
But the fact

2584
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:28.120
<v 0>remains is that guy was a part of the Harvard LSD studies and you know,</v>

2585
02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:30.710
they're very secretive about what actually went on in those.

2586
02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:33.760
<v 2>Which studies are we talking about it at the divinity school?
Uh,</v>

2587
02:25:33.770 --> 02:25:36.330
I'll tell you right now,
Ted Kaczynski,
cause they designed,

2588
02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:40.850
they did studies with divinity school students at Harvard and then leary and

2589
02:25:40.851 --> 02:25:42.950
Alpert now wronged us,

2590
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:47.840
gave Psilocybin,
I think it was to some of their students,

2591
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:50.900
but relatively light doses as far as I know.

2592
02:25:51.050 --> 02:25:54.620
<v 0>Yeah.
But that's the problem.
When you say that a prize,
what was far as I know,</v>

2593
02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:56.540
you know,
I don't know what they did either,

2594
02:25:56.541 --> 02:26:00.140
but if I was fucking up a bunch of people's brains and afterwards people came to

2595
02:26:00.141 --> 02:26:02.900
interview me,
I'd say relatively small dose.

2596
02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:05.780
<v 2>Have you seen being created a unit bombers or anything?</v>

2597
02:26:05.781 --> 02:26:09.550
Have you guys seen that image of Ergot under a microscope and he's seen,

2598
02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:14.110
I'm sure.
Have you seen that Joe?
It looks like mushrooms.
That's amazing.

2599
02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:18.600
<v 0>Yeah.
Here it is.
Um,
this is,
uh,</v>

2600
02:26:19.090 --> 02:26:22.470
the 1959,
uh,
Ted Kaczynski was a,

2601
02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:26.250
he was a absolutely a part of it.
80 sophomores.

2602
02:26:26.251 --> 02:26:29.850
The administer a series of scales of a questionnaires dealing with various

2603
02:26:29.851 --> 02:26:33.330
dimensions of personality,
pick 25 subjects,
some extremely high,

2604
02:26:33.331 --> 02:26:34.290
some extremely low,

2605
02:26:34.291 --> 02:26:38.040
and some in the middle of each of these scales studied 25 subjects over a year

2606
02:26:38.041 --> 02:26:43.041
period by the multiform method of assessment come up with 700 rank orders using

2607
02:26:44.221 --> 02:26:49.221
computer obtained clusters of inter correlating correlations factors.

2608
02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.710
But final decisions are reached after prolonged discussions and reassessments

2609
02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:55.500
enormous amounts of data,
which staff analyzes,

2610
02:26:55.501 --> 02:26:58.230
interprets and formulates while they're on als.

2611
02:26:58.290 --> 02:27:01.490
<v 2>D does it say anything about LSD?
Yes.</v>

2612
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:02.463
<v 11>MMM.</v>

2613
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:07.610
<v 0>This is,
uh,
this is part one of this whole thing.
Oh.
They also,
um,</v>

2614
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:12.440
that no evidence LSD was ever used.
Hold on a second.

2615
02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.440
This is all very complicated shit apparently.

2616
02:27:15.470 --> 02:27:20.270
And it's hard to discern what exactly was going on during this,
uh,
these studies,

2617
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:23.210
<v 2>by the way,
I just,
I just want to,
I want to put in professors,</v>

2618
02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:25.910
I mean to interrupt you while you're looking at it.

2619
02:27:25.911 --> 02:27:30.770
I want to put in a good word for the Unabomber.
It's not,
dude,
I'm not convinced,

2620
02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:33.110
Jeff,
that he's a nut.

2621
02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:38.380
What I think that he took his line of reasoning too far.

2622
02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.460
Obviously he's killing people.

2623
02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:45.700
But we could say the same thing about all sorts of politicians and leaders

2624
02:27:46.371 --> 02:27:49.520
around the world who killed people over an idea that they take too far,

2625
02:27:49.850 --> 02:27:54.680
but I think is fundamental.
Uh,
argument against civilization has some merit.

2626
02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:55.701
I'll just say that.

2627
02:27:55.701 --> 02:27:58.340
And then the other thing I wanted to say is there's a difference between

2628
02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:00.800
pedophiles and pet arrests.

2629
02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.300
And it's something I didn't really understand until I started talking about

2630
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:06.051
pedophiles.

2631
02:28:06.051 --> 02:28:10.370
And somebody wrote to me and pointed out that a pedophile is someone who has

2632
02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:14.750
sexual attraction for people that we consider too young to be appropriate.

2633
02:28:14.750 --> 02:28:19.360
Whether that's it 18 or 16 or 12 or whatever,
generally pre pubescent though,

2634
02:28:19.850 --> 02:28:24.560
um,
and a pet or rast is someone who acts on it.
Ah,
and there's a,

2635
02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:28.360
you know,
that's an important distinction because I remember reading this uh,

2636
02:28:28.430 --> 02:28:31.400
thing and Dan savage is column where somebody wrote into him and said,
look,

2637
02:28:31.430 --> 02:28:35.810
I'm attracted to kids sexually.
I would never touch a kid.
I,
I,
you know,

2638
02:28:35.811 --> 02:28:38.620
but it's in me.
I can't help it.
It's in me.
I,

2639
02:28:38.621 --> 02:28:41.270
I want to and I want to get therapy.

2640
02:28:41.271 --> 02:28:45.770
I want someone to help me strengthen my resolve.
Never to do this.

2641
02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:47.750
But by law,

2642
02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:52.560
American therapists have to report you if you express a sexual desire toward

2643
02:28:52.561 --> 02:28:53.270
children.

2644
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:58.270
So this guy is a fundamentally prohibited from seeking any help.

2645
02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:02.930
There are no like group therapy sessions.
There's no,
if you're that,

2646
02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:05.540
you've got that in you.
And we know that,
you know,

2647
02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.950
the kinks of all sorts get placed in a personality and you can't get it out.

2648
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:14.810
But you can learn to deal with it,
choose how to,
how to enact it or not enacted.

2649
02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:18.260
But pedophiles have no opportunity for that.
In Canada they do.

2650
02:29:18.261 --> 02:29:19.500
But in the United States they can,

2651
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:24.040
<v 1>yeah,
they sealed his,
they sealed the records from,
uh,</v>

2652
02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:26.060
from Harvard class of 1962.

2653
02:29:26.061 --> 02:29:29.060
They sealed all the records on Kaczynski and they won't release him,

2654
02:29:29.690 --> 02:29:32.420
but he was absolutely a part of something called the Murray study.

2655
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:34.430
And the Murray study was,
uh,

2656
02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.470
the Murray Center seals a Kaczynski data is fucking fascinating shit,

2657
02:29:39.471 --> 02:29:41.590
man.
They might cook that to his brain.

2658
02:29:42.090 --> 02:29:45.170
They might've cooked that dude's brand and created a monster,
but he's,

2659
02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:49.040
you're right though.
He sees the future of the industrial society.

2660
02:29:49.041 --> 02:29:52.220
That is what he was describing.
You're right.
That he sees like,
oh my God,

2661
02:29:52.221 --> 02:29:53.300
this can only go one way.

2662
02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:57.650
But in his crate state where he wasn't able to dance and play music,

2663
02:29:57.651 --> 02:29:58.880
like Alan Watts suggested,

2664
02:29:58.881 --> 02:30:02.510
he was only able to focus on the finish line of the machines taking over the

2665
02:30:02.511 --> 02:30:03.010
world.

2666
02:30:03.010 --> 02:30:05.330
<v 7>Yeah.
And he turned into the fire.
He turned into the mom.
Yeah.</v>

2667
02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:08.150
<v 1>He's way bigger monster than the society that he was trying to just,</v>

2668
02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:10.970
<v 7>well what a disservice he did for his message.
Cause now there's,</v>

2669
02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:15.630
there's a fucking mail bomb underlining everything he did.
So even if he did it,

2670
02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:18.380
even if there was a bunch of good stuffi shit all over his own work,

2671
02:30:18.381 --> 02:30:21.910
cause he didn't have the foresight to understand that you can't,
you,
you,

2672
02:30:21.911 --> 02:30:26.911
you're using the tools of the people that you're so angry at to try to change

2673
02:30:26.961 --> 02:30:30.560
the people you are so angry at like every terrorist,
right?
Yeah.

2674
02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:34.110
<v 1>Well everybody who thinks that they're right,
the net is the documentary,</v>

2675
02:30:34.111 --> 02:30:38.490
the Unibomber Lsd and the answer net really fascinating stuff.
I recommend it.

2676
02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:40.830
Very interesting.
And,
uh,
you know,

2677
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:44.460
the reality of the United States experiment and whether or not they really did

2678
02:30:44.461 --> 02:30:48.510
this with his French town,
I should probably throw that into Snopes.
Right.

2679
02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:53.580
Maybe it'll Snopes.
We'll be able to tell me.
That's not true.
Let's,
no,
but um,

2680
02:30:54.480 --> 02:30:57.420
<v 7>Snopes is great.
It's a heartbreaker though sometimes.
Yeah.</v>

2681
02:30:57.421 --> 02:30:59.460
But those heartbreaks are important.
Okay.

2682
02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:03.890
<v 1>Brad Snopes did to,
to do,
they must have it.
Oh,</v>

2683
02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:06.140
it's just a message board.
The message board is really good.

2684
02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:10.180
<v 2>Tricky.
They haven't,
now that you mentioned it though,</v>

2685
02:31:10.181 --> 02:31:12.760
I have read about that and not that that makes it true,

2686
02:31:12.761 --> 02:31:16.630
but I have heard about that in the past.
Well,
they do.

2687
02:31:16.690 --> 02:31:20.090
I mean we know that the CIA was dosing.
Sure.

2688
02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:24.810
<v 1>A question that they did do it and that's one of the problems with p being a</v>

2689
02:31:24.811 --> 02:31:26.480
black and white sort of a person.
Yeah.

2690
02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:30.690
Like being a a yes to the government's good or you know,
the government's bad.

2691
02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:31.311
You know,
it's,

2692
02:31:31.311 --> 02:31:34.860
it's really hard to be either or because there's a lot of crazy shit going on

2693
02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:38.850
and I find that a lot of these people that are never willing to entertain any

2694
02:31:38.851 --> 02:31:40.320
conspiracy theories at all,

2695
02:31:40.530 --> 02:31:42.960
one of the reasons why they do it is because they don't want to be thought of as

2696
02:31:42.961 --> 02:31:46.950
a fool.
They want to be a no nonsense person and a no nonsense person.

2697
02:31:46.951 --> 02:31:49.740
Almost always sides with the official story.
Right.

2698
02:31:49.741 --> 02:31:54.270
They think that there's don sense.
Yeah.
Which is nonsense.
But many,
many times.

2699
02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:55.860
You know,
my favorite one is just the,

2700
02:31:56.010 --> 02:31:59.160
the idea of the conspiracy of nine 11 you know,

2701
02:31:59.161 --> 02:32:02.700
I've had this with many people that or no nonsense type and you say,

2702
02:32:02.701 --> 02:32:05.940
do you believe that nine of nine 11 happened?
And if they say yes,
you go,

2703
02:32:05.941 --> 02:32:07.860
well then you believe in conspiracies.
Right?

2704
02:32:07.861 --> 02:32:11.700
Cause they s who no matter who did that,
that was a fucking conspiracy.
Right.

2705
02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:15.090
I forget who I would like to give someone credit for that quote.

2706
02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:18.420
I don't remember who it was though.
I think why was one of us,
I think,

2707
02:32:18.450 --> 02:32:20.760
I don't know who it was.
It might've been me,
I don't know.

2708
02:32:20.970 --> 02:32:21.810
It might've been somebody else,

2709
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:26.580
but I remember that s thinking that for the first time it's like such a great

2710
02:32:26.581 --> 02:32:30.990
and elegant way to describe the potential for conspiracy and that people don't

2711
02:32:30.991 --> 02:32:32.880
want to look at the potential for conspiracy.

2712
02:32:32.881 --> 02:32:36.810
They want to pretend that everything is exactly as CNN tells you.

2713
02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:38.160
And other than that,

2714
02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:42.300
it's just a bunch of shit that's a little wishy washy to protect terrorism.

2715
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:44.023
Terrorism.

2716
02:32:44.450 --> 02:32:47.570
<v 3>Yeah.
Well or to park.
It's depending on what side of the fence you're on.</v>

2717
02:32:47.571 --> 02:32:49.460
You know,
like we're,
you know,

2718
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:52.790
if you're getting cluster bombs dropped on you by robots,
then you're,

2719
02:32:52.850 --> 02:32:55.780
that's a terrorist act.
If the most terror,
it's,

2720
02:32:55.781 --> 02:32:58.430
I'm a fucking robot that can't even tell whether or not you're the right guy to

2721
02:32:58.431 --> 02:33:00.480
go after.
It truly is a terror inducer.

2722
02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:05.060
I mean the United States and deuces terror and so many people all the time.
Well,

2723
02:33:05.061 --> 02:33:05.440
how about this

2724
02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:08.530
<v 1>latest revelations that they use metadata to find cell phones.</v>

2725
02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:12.910
They used the data that says that this is like,
this is,
you know,

2726
02:33:13.300 --> 02:33:16.270
your cell phone and they want to get you so they shoot a missile up the cell

2727
02:33:16.271 --> 02:33:17.590
phone hoping you're near it.

2728
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:22.210
Like that is one of the most evil indiscriminate acts of destruction and murder

2729
02:33:22.211 --> 02:33:23.920
that you could ever possibly engage in.

2730
02:33:23.921 --> 02:33:27.880
You don't care if there's babies next to that cell phone playing fucking candy

2731
02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:31.000
chase on it or wherever these fucking games are.
The kids play these days,

2732
02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:35.190
candy cluster,
whatever it is,
candy crush,
candy crush saga.
You're,

2733
02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:38.940
you're just shooting at a phone.
I mean the idea that you just shooting a phone.

2734
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.420
Yeah,

2735
02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:41.760
<v 3>that's insane.
Have you seen,
have you,</v>

2736
02:33:41.970 --> 02:33:45.300
but if you seem like then you see Obama in between two ferns,

2737
02:33:45.330 --> 02:33:49.020
did you see him with his back?
It's in between two ferns.
It's today.

2738
02:33:49.021 --> 02:33:53.850
It came out today.
Whoa.
And you just see this really like,
he seemed so affable.

2739
02:33:54.090 --> 02:33:57.990
He's like the sweetest murder.
Like you look at him,
I'm like,
God damn it man.

2740
02:33:57.991 --> 02:34:00.090
He just seems really hip and cool and like,

2741
02:34:00.270 --> 02:34:04.630
but it is interesting how like they've,
they are using,
you know,
they,

2742
02:34:04.631 --> 02:34:07.170
they're getting savvy,
you know what I mean?
They're like,

2743
02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:10.350
they're really smart about getting their stuff out.
I think it is that cool.

2744
02:34:11.890 --> 02:34:14.920
<v 1>Anything other than the president of the United States when need the president</v>

2745
02:34:14.921 --> 02:34:17.200
United States.
It's like,
people say me.

2746
02:34:17.201 --> 02:34:19.690
Why don't you say more funny shit when you're hosting fear factor?
Well,

2747
02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:22.570
because that wasn't my job.
My job was to show the host fear factor.

2748
02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:25.000
His job is to meet the terrible analogy.

2749
02:34:25.001 --> 02:34:28.900
I know a factor in the president United States,
but I don't think,

2750
02:34:28.901 --> 02:34:31.710
I think he might just,
it might be a good analogy because I think he's a,

2751
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:33.150
he's an actor,
you know,

2752
02:34:33.151 --> 02:34:36.130
I think he plays a role and that role is the role of the leader of the free

2753
02:34:36.131 --> 02:34:38.770
world.
And I don't think anybody is,
there's,
there's no leader,

2754
02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:42.520
there's a bunch of fucking people that influence whoever is in the position that

2755
02:34:42.521 --> 02:34:45.640
they call a leader and,
and we don't see them.
Yeah.

2756
02:34:45.641 --> 02:34:48.910
And I don't think we're ever going to really get a handle on how the whole thing

2757
02:34:48.911 --> 02:34:51.220
is fucking working.
I don't,
I don't,
I just don't think we will.

2758
02:34:51.221 --> 02:34:54.940
But you can get a good indication,
either one or two things about Obama.

2759
02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:58.420
We think he's affable and he's very friendly and nice,
which I agree with.

2760
02:34:58.690 --> 02:34:59.770
So that's the case.

2761
02:34:59.950 --> 02:35:03.850
Why has he done things differently once he got into office then what he said he

2762
02:35:03.851 --> 02:35:07.290
would do before he got into office.
Is it because once you've got in there,

2763
02:35:07.310 --> 02:35:11.140
he realized that this world is way more fucked and way scarier than anybody

2764
02:35:11.141 --> 02:35:15.130
could possibly imagine that it's not inside the White House or is he just being

2765
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:18.910
influenced by some unbelievably powerful machine that he can't do anything
about.

2766
02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:22.060
So He's forced to sort of placate these people that got them into positions of

2767
02:35:22.061 --> 02:35:25.540
power and do their bidding regardless of what his campaign promises are.

2768
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:27.270
Either option is not good,

2769
02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:30.990
<v 4>but you do look at the economy now and it seems to be doing good.
There's drops.</v>

2770
02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:34.170
What?
So who is the stock market's going up?

2771
02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:36.840
That's why they say it's good because the stock market's going up.

2772
02:35:36.841 --> 02:35:38.670
But you even look at,
you know,
the,

2773
02:35:38.671 --> 02:35:40.830
the employment numbers are going up a little bit,

2774
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:45.120
but look at what kind of jobs those are.
They're all low paying jobs.
So,
you know,

2775
02:35:45.121 --> 02:35:47.430
it's like they,
they fuck with the metrics to make it,

2776
02:35:47.610 --> 02:35:51.120
make the message what they want it to be.
Right.
Well,
it's just,
yeah,
I,
I,

2777
02:35:51.330 --> 02:35:55.170
I am not an Obama fan,
not an Obama defender.
It's hard.

2778
02:35:55.171 --> 02:35:57.600
I just can't swallow the fact that he's okay,
you know,

2779
02:35:57.601 --> 02:36:00.440
blowing up wedding parties and stuff.
Withdrawns and also I,

2780
02:36:00.810 --> 02:36:03.990
it's hard for me to swallow the fact that he doesn't have the balls to come out

2781
02:36:03.991 --> 02:36:07.380
and maybe you can't,
but I wish he'd like stick up for snowed and it'd be like,

2782
02:36:07.381 --> 02:36:10.600
this is a whistleblower.
He did a good thing.
Let's pardon this motherfucker.

2783
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:14.270
You know how about his Po,
his campaign website,
they changed the,

2784
02:36:14.430 --> 02:36:17.670
the literature and exactly website cause they kept it up for the longest time,

2785
02:36:17.671 --> 02:36:21.930
but it was,
there was a very specific chapter or part about whistle blowers.

2786
02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:25.050
Marijuana is becoming legal under his presidency.

2787
02:36:25.051 --> 02:36:26.660
Marijuana seems to be becoming a leader.

2788
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.950
Is that something that you just can't stop?
I mean at one point in time when,

2789
02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:33.030
when is this country going to have an Arab spring moment if they keep fucking

2790
02:36:33.031 --> 02:36:36.060
with us and taking away personal liberties is going to come a moment where

2791
02:36:36.061 --> 02:36:38.610
people are not gonna want to deal with it anymore.
One of the things,

2792
02:36:38.611 --> 02:36:41.670
it's pretty easy to give up on his marijuana because by Golly,

2793
02:36:41.671 --> 02:36:44.130
look at what's going on in Colorado.
They're profiting from it.

2794
02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:47.400
It's become part of the economy that is always there,

2795
02:36:47.401 --> 02:36:50.070
but now it's officially a part where they're paying taxes.

2796
02:36:50.250 --> 02:36:55.110
They're making millions of dollars in taxes in Colorado from marijuana since

2797
02:36:55.111 --> 02:36:57.370
February.
I mean,

2798
02:36:57.540 --> 02:37:01.140
I'll never be an Arab spring here because the powers that be here or too smart,

2799
02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.110
what they do is every time the pressure builds up too much,

2800
02:37:04.111 --> 02:37:08.130
they let out a little pressure by electing,
allowing to be elected,

2801
02:37:08.131 --> 02:37:10.230
a cool seeming black dude for example.

2802
02:37:10.410 --> 02:37:13.830
Or by allowing the legalization of marijuana for example.

2803
02:37:13.831 --> 02:37:16.190
That lets a little pressure things.
I think

2804
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:19.550
<v 2>at the end of the Bush presidency and with the economic collapse and the people</v>

2805
02:37:19.551 --> 02:37:23.210
were angry enough,
you know,
that there was something was going to happen.

2806
02:37:23.211 --> 02:37:25.910
So they just,
you know,
like any good negotiator,
you know,

2807
02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:29.450
give something you can afford to lose to keep the other person from pulling out

2808
02:37:29.451 --> 02:37:32.240
of the deal.
I think that's what happens in this country.

2809
02:37:32.241 --> 02:37:35.630
I think the mistake that happens in Arab countries or other countries where

2810
02:37:35.631 --> 02:37:38.990
their hands are tied by some,
you know,
empire system,

2811
02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:43.100
they can't play those games or that they're not predisposed to do that.

2812
02:37:43.101 --> 02:37:44.390
They don't want to give up any power.

2813
02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:48.770
So I think in this country that's the problem.
We're being numbed by technology.

2814
02:37:48.771 --> 02:37:51.410
We think we tweet something,
we've done a revolutionary act,

2815
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:53.750
and every time things really get serious,

2816
02:37:53.751 --> 02:37:56.090
they'll give a little same thing in the depression,
right?

2817
02:37:56.091 --> 02:37:57.290
Things were really serious.

2818
02:37:57.530 --> 02:38:01.190
First they attacked anyone who had anything to do with communism in the 20s the

2819
02:38:01.191 --> 02:38:04.430
red scare.
Right.
You know,
then the,
the depression comes along.

2820
02:38:04.431 --> 02:38:08.990
They allow Roosevelt to get in there.
He is able to pass some,
some laws,

2821
02:38:08.991 --> 02:38:11.630
social security,
you know,
taking care of old people,

2822
02:38:11.930 --> 02:38:16.430
dealing with some of the sources of the greatest resentment and anger.

2823
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:19.580
Neutralize those a little bit so we can keep playing the game.

2824
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:21.520
Don't fundamentally restructure any,

2825
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:24.790
<v 1>we'd have to have massive support of the people that got you in power to</v>

2826
02:38:24.791 --> 02:38:27.850
fundamentally restructure things.
And there's no motivation for them to do

2827
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:29.710
<v 2>right.
They like it the way it is.</v>

2828
02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:32.990
<v 1>Problem that we were talking about earlier with corporations.</v>

2829
02:38:32.991 --> 02:38:36.830
They don't act in the interest of human beings yet they're conducted and they're

2830
02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:39.020
made out of human beings.
I mean,

2831
02:38:39.021 --> 02:38:41.750
they're constructed from human beings and they don't like human beings.

2832
02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:47.520
<v 2>Yeah.
But it's sorta like,
I mean,
and I hate doing this because it's a beautiful,</v>

2833
02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:51.250
it it,
it celebrates music.
It's kind of like music,
right?

2834
02:38:51.251 --> 02:38:56.251
I mean his music made from guitars and violins and pianos or is music something

2835
02:38:56.651 --> 02:39:00.070
else?
I kind of feel like corporations are like that.

2836
02:39:00.071 --> 02:39:04.550
They're like some sort of spirit or something that abuse the participants.

2837
02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:05.720
<v 7>Right?
Oh,</v>

2838
02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:10.900
that's so weird to like all the people in a corporation or all possessed by the

2839
02:39:11.001 --> 02:39:13.220
spirit and they don't even know they're possessed by it,

2840
02:39:13.221 --> 02:39:15.550
even though their entire lives are centered around it.
Right.

2841
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:20.180
And they're all so the spirit is manifesting through the corporation and you're

2842
02:39:20.181 --> 02:39:24.020
basically seeing like one of the old school deities that people used to worship

2843
02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:25.610
way back in the day,

2844
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:30.790
manifesting in a modern way through this organized coven of people who all think

2845
02:39:31.371 --> 02:39:34.760
they're doing the right thing or their own little thing or whatever,

2846
02:39:34.761 --> 02:39:39.230
and they don't realize that together they form a demon.
Exactly.

2847
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:40.833
It seems

2848
02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:44.710
<v 1>also that everything fucking changes.
I mean if you look at the world,</v>

2849
02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:48.310
you look at the universe,
you look at the birth of stars,
stellar nurseries,

2850
02:39:48.311 --> 02:39:50.680
you look at hyper Novas,
the death of stars.

2851
02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:54.430
You look at all these different things like the whole universe is in a constant

2852
02:39:54.431 --> 02:39:58.810
state of change and our idea is that somehow or another winner reached some

2853
02:39:58.811 --> 02:40:02.470
point of peace where everything is going to calm down and we can enjoy our,

2854
02:40:02.471 --> 02:40:05.890
our society and our golden years and it's never going to happen.

2855
02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:09.730
It's going to be in a constant state of Yin Yang,
a push and pull to the,

2856
02:40:09.731 --> 02:40:11.920
to the very end to whatever.

2857
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:16.170
I mean the exist existence that we're currently participating in seems to have

2858
02:40:16.171 --> 02:40:19.050
those laws pretty from.
The tide goes in,

2859
02:40:19.051 --> 02:40:22.830
the tide goes out the fucking planet spinning around the stars and stars
explode.

2860
02:40:22.831 --> 02:40:26.670
Eventually the plaids dry up.
Star dust becomes more people,

2861
02:40:26.671 --> 02:40:29.610
more people figure out the Adam,
they split that bitch.
They fucked

2862
02:40:29.650 --> 02:40:32.360
<v 3>can start making nuclear weapons.
They shoot to the moon.</v>

2863
02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:36.890
They just keeps going on and on and on like an endless cycle of the same thing

2864
02:40:36.891 --> 02:40:39.950
happening over and over and over again.
Constantly changing,

2865
02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:43.700
constantly moving forward.
Complexifying pulling in and pulling out.

2866
02:40:43.730 --> 02:40:47.410
It's complexify.
Yeah.
That's this thing I just read complex of.

2867
02:40:47.450 --> 02:40:48.231
If you heard about this,

2868
02:40:48.231 --> 02:40:51.980
how complexity doesn't seem to fit in into the idea of a universe cooling down

2869
02:40:51.981 --> 02:40:53.930
because of entropy,
which is the opposite.

2870
02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:57.380
It kind of flies in the face of everything that things are becoming more and

2871
02:40:57.381 --> 02:41:02.090
more complex because what is,
how is things if the energy is running out,

2872
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:06.620
it's things should not complexify.
They should simplify.
Is that correct?
Well,

2873
02:41:06.621 --> 02:41:10.070
that's entropy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a rich running down to nothing.

2874
02:41:10.071 --> 02:41:13.910
So it doesn't make sense that things are complexifying and there's some kind of

2875
02:41:14.430 --> 02:41:19.250
what,
what,
who knows what that means,
but it might indicate that we're like we,

2876
02:41:19.251 --> 02:41:22.040
the the,
the flow of time itself,

2877
02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.320
we're just perceiving it the wrong way.

2878
02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:29.320
We're like actually what we think is the past going into the future is actually

2879
02:41:29.811 --> 02:41:31.790
the future pouring into the past.

2880
02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:37.060
And the thing that's pouring into the past is some kind of super complex Harmon

2881
02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:41.330
harmonized thing.
So maybe it is possible Joe,
maybe it is possible.

2882
02:41:41.331 --> 02:41:42.890
The great giant orgy,

2883
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:47.720
the entire planet just filled with human somehow sinked up together.

2884
02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:50.870
The [inaudible],
not the Borg,
not soulless,
emotionless things,

2885
02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:53.620
but somehow we all connect and all of a sudden we're on,

2886
02:41:53.690 --> 02:41:57.980
there's the universe is just spitting out you LFOs you're the planet is,

2887
02:41:57.981 --> 02:41:58.550
you know,

2888
02:41:58.550 --> 02:42:02.600
suddenly we're like spreading through all of space after we've like first

2889
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:04.470
harmonized,
we're changing

2890
02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:06.750
<v 1>machines,
you know,
that's what we are.
We're,</v>

2891
02:42:06.751 --> 02:42:11.430
we're a part of this whole gigantic organism that's known as the earth and it's

2892
02:42:11.431 --> 02:42:14.190
a part of a gigantic organism known as a solar system,

2893
02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:17.670
which is a part of gigantic organism known as the the universe.
I mean,

2894
02:42:17.671 --> 02:42:22.020
it's just one piece of the thing and we're changed machines as a Marshall

2895
02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:22.681
Mcluhan said,
yeah,

2896
02:42:22.681 --> 02:42:26.700
and the Malt Mcluhan said that we are human beings are the sex organs of the

2897
02:42:26.701 --> 02:42:29.820
machine world and that's essentially what we're doing.
I mean,

2898
02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:34.850
our whole struggle and this desire for achieving things has a lot to do with

2899
02:42:37.111 --> 02:42:40.560
that.
It has a lot to do with us being a part of this weird process,

2900
02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:45.050
<v 2>which is why that guy said it was selfish of you not to have kids because he's</v>

2901
02:42:45.051 --> 02:42:49.160
spouting the ideology of the machine world of which were the sexual organ.
Yeah.

2902
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:53.010
<v 1>He's also a Dick Wad wants to get some Brownie points for saying someone else is</v>

2903
02:42:53.011 --> 02:42:53.844
wrong.

2904
02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:58.060
<v 2>Why won't you?
Speaking of reading and people getting involved in your business,</v>

2905
02:42:58.061 --> 02:43:01.780
why is it that right wingers are so uptight about abortion?

2906
02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.550
Because most abortions are poor people and you would think their whole thing is,

2907
02:43:06.551 --> 02:43:10.870
you know,
demonizing poor people.
So you would think that fewer,
you know,

2908
02:43:10.900 --> 02:43:11.980
non white poor

2909
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.550
<v 4>people would be a good thing from a right wing perspective and yet they're</v>

2910
02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:19.990
participating in creating more of them by making abortion a problem in this

2911
02:43:19.991 --> 02:43:22.870
country.
It's a strange thing I've never understood is a Jesus thing.

2912
02:43:22.871 --> 02:43:24.790
They don't want you killing babies and you know,

2913
02:43:24.791 --> 02:43:28.870
they look at it that that idea of choice being killing babies and babies are the

2914
02:43:28.871 --> 02:43:30.190
greatest things you could ever do.

2915
02:43:30.191 --> 02:43:33.080
How could anybody want to kill babies and the problem,

2916
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:35.980
why are they against birth control?
Well,

2917
02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:39.250
only the super religious ones are against birth control.

2918
02:43:39.251 --> 02:43:40.600
You'd have to get to the Catholics.

2919
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:44.740
It's very rare that you hear politicians talking about not being pro birth

2920
02:43:44.741 --> 02:43:46.930
control.
Whoa,
whoa.
Not In.

2921
02:43:46.931 --> 02:43:51.610
Not In most of the southern states where they only teach abstinence,
abstinence,

2922
02:43:51.611 --> 02:43:53.080
only sex ed in schools.

2923
02:43:53.350 --> 02:43:57.490
I think it's pretty rare for someone to actually stand on a platform of being

2924
02:43:57.491 --> 02:44:01.840
anti birth control in 2014 whether it's condoms or anything.

2925
02:44:01.841 --> 02:44:04.850
I think it's much more prevalent than you think.
Maybe.
Maybe.

2926
02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:08.410
I think it's Standard Fox News rhetoric.
Oh is it really?

2927
02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:14.350
That's really true.
That's,
that's ridiculous.
No other consequence box per se.

2928
02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:18.420
So it's anti pleasure because they don't want people having sex without

2929
02:44:18.430 --> 02:44:22.350
consequences.
Did you say Fox News perverts or banging each other?
Guarantee it.

2930
02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:26.990
Ah,
Jeez.
Rather embarrassed the bag tag name you do.
All right.

2931
02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:31.750
What are your friends?
I wish she's just got to get close to the high.

2932
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:34.410
What am I hate?
Fucking like have you ever or are you

2933
02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:37.970
<v 7>no,
no,
no,
no.
I know you,</v>

2934
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.660
I've never understood that the thing like you're fucking someone cause you're

2935
02:44:41.661 --> 02:44:46.280
mad at them.
I guess.
Yeah.
That just seems,
I mean

2936
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:49.630
<v 4>I,
the only time I would entertain the idea would be the Megan,</v>

2937
02:44:49.631 --> 02:44:51.690
whatever her name is.
And um,

2938
02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:57.090
<v 7>Sarah Pailin.
You would hate fucks.
They're appealing.
I would,
I wouldn't,</v>

2939
02:44:57.091 --> 02:44:59.440
I try to hate fucker,
but I bet I fall in love with her.

2940
02:45:00.290 --> 02:45:01.560
<v 4>I think so.
Sure.</v>

2941
02:45:01.561 --> 02:45:04.260
Why not do you think would really appeal to you the most about her?

2942
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:07.730
<v 7>Cause I bet she's fucking cool.
Oh,
come on.</v>

2943
02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:11.720
She's so far from the terror of it all,
man.
It's like,
don't,

2944
02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:15.380
don't confuse the persona with a person who knows what's underneath there.

2945
02:45:15.381 --> 02:45:19.130
I guarantee she's super charismatic and you did just ended up being like,
God,

2946
02:45:19.131 --> 02:45:21.500
this is amazing.
Yeah,
sure.
Fist me.
I don't care.

2947
02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:23.150
I want to see what it's like Sarah.

2948
02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:28.860
<v 4>Wow.
Uh,
histamine.
Do you think she fits people well,
that's not how you going,</v>

2949
02:45:28.930 --> 02:45:32.080
I was thinking of,
but yeah.
Dagon McCain's Kinda cool.
Actually.

2950
02:45:32.081 --> 02:45:36.700
I was thinking of Megan Kelly.
I think the blow,
I know you're thinking of,
she's,

2951
02:45:36.701 --> 02:45:41.260
she's very hot,
very like hot and really mean,
mean,

2952
02:45:41.261 --> 02:45:45.390
uptight,
like very American kind of.
Yup.
And there's some of those,
um,
the,

2953
02:45:45.391 --> 02:45:48.190
the women who do the,
the financial shit,
you know,

2954
02:45:48.191 --> 02:45:52.950
they're just so smoking hot and then they opened there.
Is that making it Kelly?

2955
02:45:52.970 --> 02:45:56.890
Yeah.
See,
look at that.
She's taught it doesn't even look like the,

2956
02:45:57.110 --> 02:46:01.090
she's standing on someone's face right now.
That's her.

2957
02:46:01.091 --> 02:46:04.060
I wanna fuck you pose.
A guy's not allowed to do that pose.
By the way.

2958
02:46:04.061 --> 02:46:04.960
If you're a newscaster,

2959
02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:08.620
I can't sit there with your fucking legs spread open gym shorts.

2960
02:46:08.621 --> 02:46:10.550
The blue ones with the white pinstriping.

2961
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:14.930
Do you guys see that thing that where the newscaster says it's in New York and

2962
02:46:14.931 --> 02:46:19.550
the guy's like,
keep fucking that chicken.
Have you seen that now?
Oh,
pull that up.

2963
02:46:19.551 --> 02:46:24.020
That that is the funniest thing ever.
It's fun to live like 6:00 PM news.

2964
02:46:24.170 --> 02:46:28.910
Why does he say keep fucking banter between the guy like the weatherman and the

2965
02:46:28.911 --> 02:46:33.140
sports guy?
Oh,
it's like it's less than a minute.
I mean if you pull it up,

2966
02:46:33.141 --> 02:46:37.550
I don't want to,
I don't want to talk about it.
Make a mistake.
I have no idea.

2967
02:46:37.551 --> 02:46:40.560
That's why I'm asking.
I thought you guys might have chicken.

2968
02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:46.100
He says that and you'll see the woman's face when he says it.

2969
02:46:46.101 --> 02:46:49.760
The newscaster woman just loses her shit.
That's really fun.

2970
02:46:49.761 --> 02:46:53.570
I'm sure if you just Google keep fucking the chicken.
It'll,
it's there.

2971
02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:58.400
That's so funny when like people on the news act normal for a second and it

2972
02:46:58.401 --> 02:47:01.700
horrifies everyone.
It's really hilarious to see.

2973
02:47:01.701 --> 02:47:04.880
Their reaction is tough man.
To make a tender forecast neck.

2974
02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:10.810
Okay.
I'll can tell you the last time.

2975
02:47:12.130 --> 02:47:15.660
You sure that's real.
I don't think it's real.
I think it's real to Ernie.

2976
02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:19.993
<v 12>Okay.</v>

2977
02:47:20.290 --> 02:47:25.220
<v 4>Yeah.
She'll look at her face.
I think it's surreal.</v>

2978
02:47:26.130 --> 02:47:30.730
They apologize.
The apology.
Well,
he just got a little crazy.

2979
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:35.770
Who knows man.
These Weirdo Illuminati people.
They probably do fuck chicken.
Yeah.

2980
02:47:35.771 --> 02:47:39.250
Maybe it's like a thing he just didn't want to tell anybody slipped out.

2981
02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:42.250
Some of those things are holding the guy.
Rotisserie chicken.

2982
02:47:42.251 --> 02:47:44.740
I bet he buys rotisserie chickens and fucks some.

2983
02:47:45.490 --> 02:47:50.410
Probably Work Ernie and asked this.
Right,
right.
Keep thinking that chicken.

2984
02:47:50.470 --> 02:47:53.590
What does that mean to the,
explain why.
Who Cares about the apology?

2985
02:47:53.591 --> 02:47:58.390
We want to know what is it?
What's it reference?
Probably on drugs,
man.

2986
02:47:58.570 --> 02:48:03.430
I think they had a conversation before they were on air where the one guy was

2987
02:48:03.431 --> 02:48:06.430
talking about fucking chickens and joking about it and then the other guy just

2988
02:48:06.431 --> 02:48:11.050
referred to it isn't a chicken the name for like a twink,

2989
02:48:11.051 --> 02:48:15.790
isn't it a gay term?
Like a chicken?
No.
Google search.
Let's look it up.

2990
02:48:15.791 --> 02:48:18.490
I think it is.
Yeah.
Would you look it up?
You can fuck chickens

2991
02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:25.180
where the egg comes out and the sex organs are all in the same hole.

2992
02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:29.580
Cox Do not have Cox.
That's a weird thing.
They don't,
they don't.
Yeah,
they,

2993
02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:33.940
they have the [inaudible] which is this whole where they're like,

2994
02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:36.460
they do what's called a [inaudible] kiss,

2995
02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:40.900
where the male and the female will line up their cloaca holes and a little thing

2996
02:48:40.901 --> 02:48:44.750
from the,
the,
the sperm shoot out of the male into the female.
Wow.

2997
02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:47.950
Can you pull that up please?

2998
02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:52.700
Twink it says the term chicken or also preferred down here.
Right?
Highlighted.

2999
02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:57.730
They call him chickens.
Chicken or chicken or,
wow.
Look at that.
Poor bastard.

3000
02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:02.960
Imagine if you were on Wikipedia and they got a picture of you are a fucking,

3001
02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:09.580
who is that guy and old statement?

3002
02:49:10.510 --> 02:49:12.090
What you want to know the word twink look,

3003
02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:16.830
look up a picture yourself in the dictionary.
It's the name there.

3004
02:49:16.831 --> 02:49:20.730
Brent Brent was the best amateur twink performer.

3005
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:25.110
Oh my God.
Well,
so he's proud.
He's proud.
Twink wow.

3006
02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:28.350
You gotta be careful,
man.
We could only have twink around ectomorphic build.

3007
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:31.020
You can only have twink around for another couple of years for someone gets

3008
02:49:31.021 --> 02:49:35.840
unbelievably offended by it and cause you a piece of shit and LBD cute.
Okay.

3009
02:49:35.850 --> 02:49:40.080
I've been living in Portland for like five days at this point and I've already

3010
02:49:40.081 --> 02:49:44.090
offended some lesbians.
Yeah,
you're going to overdose on political correctness.

3011
02:49:44.091 --> 02:49:46.530
And that's silly town.
So intense up there.
This,

3012
02:49:46.531 --> 02:49:49.290
I was sitting in a camper the other night and this woman says,

3013
02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:51.390
I remember what it was.
And this woman says,

3014
02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:57.120
well that's living in the white man's world.
And I said,
I'm not white.

3015
02:49:57.121 --> 02:50:01.440
I'm Irish and that it and get out.
They you're Irish.
I'm Irish.
It's different.

3016
02:50:01.850 --> 02:50:05.580
Oh,
I read a fan.
No,
no,

3017
02:50:05.581 --> 02:50:09.750
but she was confused by the late night.
Lighten late 19th,

3018
02:50:09.751 --> 02:50:13.800
early 20th century,
uh,
in the United States.
And of course in England,

3019
02:50:13.801 --> 02:50:18.801
the Irish were considered beneath Africans on the scale of evolved human beings.

3020
02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:24.180
That's interesting because they came last to this country.
Is that what it was?

3021
02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:29.140
No,
just cause they were like a rougher,
harder to deal with,
you know,
uh,

3022
02:50:29.250 --> 02:50:31.140
farted in public a lot things,
you know,

3023
02:50:31.141 --> 02:50:33.720
things we all know and love about the Irish.
Um,

3024
02:50:33.810 --> 02:50:36.930
but is that a thing for the new public?
No,
I just made that up.

3025
02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:40.110
It's certainly a thing happens everywhere.
You know,

3026
02:50:40.850 --> 02:50:44.820
I don't think it happens everywhere.
Farting in public or just openly in public.

3027
02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:49.920
The Irish people like when I know I'm Joe Drink George Carlin.
Yeah.

3028
02:50:49.921 --> 02:50:53.660
Beer crates,
parts cutting farts.
George Carlin had that whole,

3029
02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:55.710
that whole thing where he's like,
you know,

3030
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:58.860
how come he talked about the Irish oppression and you know,

3031
02:50:58.861 --> 02:51:01.230
don't have jobs for Irish and all that.
But he was like,

3032
02:51:01.460 --> 02:51:05.160
what the hell is with the fighting Irish?
You know,
Notre Dame,
the fighting Irish.

3033
02:51:05.161 --> 02:51:08.310
I mean,
how is that not offensive?
Right?
Like if you had the,

3034
02:51:08.311 --> 02:51:10.740
like the Lazy Mexicans take the field right.

3035
02:51:10.741 --> 02:51:12.810
Or The chiseling Jews and he does this

3036
02:51:16.230 --> 02:51:20.910
great term.
The Jews,
he's great.
Yeah,
he was awesome.
The best.

3037
02:51:21.490 --> 02:51:24.750
That's funny.
Hi Gentlemen.
I think we're a,
we're at three hours.

3038
02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:29.450
We had three hours.
These things fucking fly by.
They fly by.

3039
02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:32.220
They've been amongst the most popular podcasts that I do.

3040
02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:35.820
And I know you guys are saying the same thing.
Well it's pretty good.

3041
02:51:35.821 --> 02:51:40.770
The one we did together last time,
I guess mine was the third,
right.
Um,

3042
02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:45.330
has twice as many downloads as any other that have been up forever.

3043
02:51:45.331 --> 02:51:47.340
And the second is you,
you and me.

3044
02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:51.300
The same thing with us.
I mean these,

3045
02:51:51.301 --> 02:51:54.900
these podcasts that we have are amongst the highest downloaded ones that we
have.

3046
02:51:54.930 --> 02:51:58.020
You know,
the synergistic effect,
the one we did for sure.

3047
02:51:58.021 --> 02:52:02.250
It's the most diverse downloads I've heard.
They're really fun.
They're fun,

3048
02:52:02.251 --> 02:52:06.220
they're bizarre.
It's very bizarre combination.

3049
02:52:06.310 --> 02:52:10.120
I don't know if you guys saw,
I created a page that archives them.
Okay,
cool.

3050
02:52:10.850 --> 02:52:13.060
I'm happy to transfer it wherever we decided to do it.

3051
02:52:13.061 --> 02:52:14.950
But for the moment it's on a Chris Ryan,

3052
02:52:14.951 --> 02:52:19.951
Ph d.com and you'll see tripod cast tab and that's where the first three are

3053
02:52:20.381 --> 02:52:23.420
archive.
It's just unlink link that leads back to your site and your site.

3054
02:52:23.710 --> 02:52:26.560
We were talking before the podcast started about trying to figure out a name,

3055
02:52:26.561 --> 02:52:28.330
but we're not even close old men in the snow.

3056
02:52:28.331 --> 02:52:31.840
That was pretty bad ass because of your description of what it is.
Right.

3057
02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:35.070
But when people,
is it funny without knowing the story?
No,

3058
02:52:35.100 --> 02:52:36.220
you have to tell the story though.

3059
02:52:36.221 --> 02:52:38.740
Just tell people to start because I don't think you did while the podcast was

3060
02:52:38.741 --> 02:52:43.540
going on.
It was before the pot.
Oh,
we were talking about,
uh,
techniques that a,

3061
02:52:43.541 --> 02:52:48.541
that adolescent boys develop the good ones anyway for a not coming and uh,

3062
02:52:50.120 --> 02:52:53.530
and like some people like think of baseball stats or whatever.

3063
02:52:53.531 --> 02:52:57.460
Just something like nonsexual to get your head away from what you're doing,

3064
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:59.800
which in itself was kind of a weird thing to be,
you know,

3065
02:52:59.801 --> 02:53:02.380
you're like having the best experience of your life and you're trying not to

3066
02:53:02.381 --> 02:53:06.010
notice.
Nature wants you to come instantly and just shoot a load into a chicken,

3067
02:53:06.011 --> 02:53:09.730
make a kid,
and you want to have a good time strategy.
Well,

3068
02:53:09.731 --> 02:53:13.140
it goes back to sex at dawn.
It's,
you know,
a sperm competition.
Yes.

3069
02:53:13.350 --> 02:53:15.400
Nature has designed you to shoot your load,

3070
02:53:15.401 --> 02:53:18.790
get out of the way so the next guy can.
Exactly.
And that's why by the way,

3071
02:53:18.791 --> 02:53:23.450
were turned on by seeing gang bangs and dude's fucking a B u.
R.
Yeah.

3072
02:53:24.900 --> 02:53:29.560
Anyway,
so my technique was to think about old people trudging through the snow,

3073
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:30.700
like World War II.

3074
02:53:30.730 --> 02:53:35.340
You know Crimean refugees trudging through that Russian winter.

3075
02:53:35.341 --> 02:53:39.880
It's freezing that.
Yeah,
like that.
Babushka yeah,
exactly.

3076
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:44.200
That makes me not want to come.
Sorry guys,
I can't come now.

3077
02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:46.560
That guy's ass hole.
Imagine if that's kind of guy.

3078
02:53:46.930 --> 02:53:49.690
Would you live the rest of your life if that guy's ass asshole was permanently

3079
02:53:49.691 --> 02:53:52.210
an inch from your face?
Oh,
it is it guy.
Yeah.

3080
02:53:52.211 --> 02:53:54.340
What would you do for the rest of your life?
You can live,

3081
02:53:54.341 --> 02:53:56.870
you can do everything you want.
You can go like,
fuck you

3082
02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:03.880
asshole.
Be like,
no,
right here to the right.
You can move it around.

3083
02:54:03.881 --> 02:54:06.940
But it always has to stay like sort of like the,
like the moon is in your orbit.

3084
02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:10.730
That guy's ass hole.
He's raw ass.
You know what?

3085
02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:14.140
After a week or two you wouldn't even notice it.
Say that I would kill myself.

3086
02:54:14.170 --> 02:54:18.910
I would kill myself,
push that guy with me.
I would just,
I didn't enjoy my life.

3087
02:54:18.911 --> 02:54:23.860
Fart and in your face,
no asshole.
Ever Lens in the wrong place.

3088
02:54:23.890 --> 02:54:28.600
That's what the Buddhists say.
Okay?
Both of you guys and that,

3089
