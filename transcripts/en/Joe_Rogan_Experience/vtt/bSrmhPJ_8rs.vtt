00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I got a story that I don't want to tell because in front of my girlfriend,</v>

3
00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>because it will upset because a,</v>

4
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I would make my life a bit harder and I don't want to tell it on,</v>

5
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.700
<v Speaker 1>on any tonight shows or anything.</v>

6
00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell her here.</v>

7
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>But I just did a Zombie movie in Australia,</v>

8
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>which isn't anything to do with the story,</v>

9
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>but they're always in Australia.</v>

10
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.541
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

11
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:17.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:18.171
<v Speaker 1>it's dry.</v>

13
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And my parents drive to Canberra where we were at on the weekend to spend a day</v>

14
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:22.491
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

15
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:23.031
<v Speaker 1>It's fair enough.</v>

16
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't see my parents and in six months or something,</v>

17
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>so I'm spending time with my mom and dad.</v>

18
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Now back in the early nineties my father was getting closer to retirement and</v>

19
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>then he found a credit card bill because my mother took care of the money fan at</v>

20
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:35.991
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

21
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 1>She'd run up $90,000 worth of bills,</v>

22
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>which made my dad had to work an extra sort of eight years past retirement to</v>

23
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>pay these all often she'd kept it all secret.</v>

24
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.583
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

25
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So now my parents who've got to retirement,</v>

26
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>they own the house and they just get a pension of like Australian government</v>

27
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>gives each person like $300 a week pension,</v>

28
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>which is like two 60 American,</v>

29
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>So my parents live off that and then,</v>

31
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but my father takes care of all the money.</v>

32
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>He pays all the bills and he bounced books cause my mom can't be trusted when it</v>

33
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:04.454
<v Speaker 1>comes to shopping.</v>

34
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm talking to my parents,</v>

35
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>my mom goes,</v>

36
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>all I want is my half of the money,</v>

37
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>his half of the money and then we'll see.</v>

38
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>He can have his half of the money,</v>

39
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>it will split the bills and then I can do what I want with my money.</v>

40
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>But instead I'm given an allowance because I'm not responsible enough money.</v>

41
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:19.191
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

42
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:19.371
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

43
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't take care of the money ma'am.</v>

44
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't because you'll fuck it up.</v>

45
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>You'll go online,</v>

46
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

47
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you've found Internet shopping now you'll fuck it up,</v>

48
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:27.411
<v Speaker 1>you'll get rid of,</v>

49
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose everything and get more credit.</v>

50
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Cards will be terrible.</v>

51
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

52
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

53
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the problem with money anymore.</v>

54
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Your father's the one that spends all the money.</v>

55
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Now we're in a public bar,</v>

56
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:37.221
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

57
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.990
<v Speaker 1>There's many people sitting around us.</v>

58
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a very public,</v>

59
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:40.664
<v Speaker 1>open area.</v>

60
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Your father's the one who spends all the money now and then she pointed,</v>

61
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 1>my dad goes,</v>

62
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>tell him,</v>

63
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>tell him what you spend your money on.</v>

64
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And I've already clicked what this white be and I've gone,</v>

65
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

66
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

67
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

68
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.043
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know.</v>

69
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know.</v>

70
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.561
<v Speaker 1>And then what my,</v>

71
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>there goes.</v>

72
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Your father gets prostitutes,</v>

73
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.853
<v Speaker 1>And I've gone,</v>

75
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

76
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>just shut up both of your police and she's gone.</v>

77
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Every Wednesday your father,</v>

79
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>before he goes to play lawn bowls goes off.</v>

80
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>It gets himself a prostitute.</v>

81
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And then my dad went,</v>

82
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>not every Wednesday,</v>

83
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.703
<v Speaker 1>not</v>

84
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>every Wednesday may seem,</v>

85
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>sounds like at least three out of four Wednesdays.</v>

86
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It takes a week.</v>

87
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Cough every now and again,</v>

88
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>like it costs,</v>

89
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>you mean Australian money for a very cheap prostitute.</v>

90
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>It's legal in Australia in a brothel,</v>

91
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe a hundred bucks for a pretty low end sort of girl or Robin tag power.</v>

92
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 1>So he went to a place to get it done.</v>

93
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>He didn't?</v>

94
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

95
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

96
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.711
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

97
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not like here where you've got to go to a hotel and that type of stuff.</v>

98
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>They just brothels in there.</v>

99
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>They're very league and they've very well sign posted and stuff.</v>

100
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

101
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a big deal in Australia.</v>

102
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It's actually makes it a bit safer,</v>

103
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:53.541
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

104
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>because the girls have to get tested.</v>

105
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>They have to bring their results in all the time,</v>

106
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're paying tax.</v>

107
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>He makes it safer.</v>

108
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like else.</v>

109
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the government says it can't be a legal,</v>

110
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>when it's something that people really enjoy doing,</v>

111
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>low is doesn't work substantially,</v>

112
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.963
<v Speaker 1>of course does.</v>

113
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.051
<v Speaker 1>Sure it does.</v>

114
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.884
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't begrudge my dad for doing this.</v>

116
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to hear about it.</v>

117
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They're in their seventies my mom's morbidly obese.</v>

118
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's still quite fit.</v>

119
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:16.571
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

120
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>He wants to get his ender way sometimes.</v>

121
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
