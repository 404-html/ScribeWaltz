<v Speaker 1>You guys can't hear it,</v>

12
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my computer's a volume was on of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a sponsor of our show is </v>

14
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.111
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little button right in the </v>

15
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:39.111
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

16
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Upper level around background thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upper level.</v>

17
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Is it off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's tough.</v>

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

20
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea first of all,</v>

21
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:56.571
<v Speaker 1>why the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they offered to sponsor the show </v>

22
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:56.571
<v Speaker 1>and I said why not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why in the shape of the flash light?</v>

24
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it a flashlight?</v>

25
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it easier to hold so you can</v>

26
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>fuck it easier.</v>

27
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you're,</v>

28
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>once you're done and you ejaculate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you open that?</v>

29
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say.</v>

30
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You unscrew the bottom and released the </v>

31
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just slithers out no into the sink.</v>

32
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like something else that it is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>shameful for some reason than </v>

33
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels way better,</v>

34
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's more shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

35
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>like I always joke that as I'm coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm regretting it as I'm coming on this.</v>

36
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It also serve as a flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't light up and cases,</v>

37
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>not a flashlight should have a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>laser pointer or something like that.</v>

38
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a silly little piece of shit </v>

39
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>talking about flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

40
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>If you want pink and last night you </v>
<v Speaker 1>performed for pink.</v>

41
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a fucking shitty segway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that asshole.</v>

42
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>How dare you subjected my ears to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was that though?</v>

43
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

44
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>pretty cool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She called me up and she asked me if I </v>

45
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 2>would do her a birthday party for her </v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend,</v>

46
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 2>a carey heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 2>the BMX guy and all that and I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>done a private anything in forever.</v>

48
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

49
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan and stuff,</v>

50
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>but it seems weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

51
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

52
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

53
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 2>how much I can pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like a,</v>

55
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a few weeks ago when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal came together.</v>

56
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

57
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 2>if you can do that and get me a court </v>
<v Speaker 2>side for Lakers,</v>

58
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Celtics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was impossible.</v>

59
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to get courtside last </v>

60
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>minute for the series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she called back.</v>

61
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.491
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got court side for the last two games </v>

<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's an incredible performer.</v>

85
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a whole blog about her.</v>

86
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I not hearing myself?</v>

87
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.400
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that it was just that.</v>

88
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Just the vine for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

89
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

90
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a whole blog about her </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance at the emmy's that I watched</v>

91
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

92
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A voice was perfect.</v>

93
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 3>The way she carried herself was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when she actually suspended </v>

94
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 3>herself and started spinning around like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way.</v>

95
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 3>She's really this good and she's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

96
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really singing the whole time.</v>

97
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 3>And even people on the radio were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was limp sanken.</v>

98
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she was.</v>

99
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't,</v>

100
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't doing that and seeing anyways</v>
<v Speaker 1>as ridiculous if she really was doing.</v>

101
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.810
<v Speaker 1>She just fell doing that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

102
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I saw that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

103
00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:01.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

104
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Scariest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fell,</v>

105
00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>but when she fell for wire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled her and pulled it to the very end</v>

106
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 1>til it was taught and I thought if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapped,</v>

107
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it could have cut her head off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

108
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And then it would have been the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular video on how crazy would that </v>

109
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.481
<v Speaker 1>have been?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine watching pink get her </v>

110
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>head cut off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitated.</v>

111
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.780
<v Speaker 1>But you imagine if that was a real viral</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

112
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the sales would go up because </v>

00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 3>So they go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buy Your Shit.</v>

121
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Even though they forgot about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Michael Jackson,</v>

122
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

123
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 3>incredibly brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talented,</v>

124
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.760
<v Speaker 3>but after he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

125
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:47.520
<v Speaker 3>everybody went fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody went nuts to buy shit.</v>

126
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fake for a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

127
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm Kinda like,</v>

128
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

129
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she theorist a little bit,</v>

130
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I thought that,</v>

131
00:04:55.571 --> 00:05:00.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd pop out like six months later </v>

132
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>because he needed something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed the love back man.</v>

133
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of people that were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling Michael Jackson for a long time.</v>

134
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's ever even tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull that death off.</v>

135
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I think if you tried to die and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a federal crime,</v>

136
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I think if you visit really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're allowed to do that,</v>

138
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even as a publicity stunt,</v>

139
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>you would have to have medical records </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have medical records and </v>

140
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>people are going to find out they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

141
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>If you're faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

142
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he can do it.</v>

143
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 1>The whole Tupac thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous how it's gotten that </v>

144
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Elvis too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

145
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So all Elvis back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could pull it off.</v>

146
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed JFK.</v>

147
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>They could probably fuck elvis up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:39.121
<v Speaker 1>that was the whole thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody said Elvis faked his death to </v>

149
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>get away from the colonel to live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal life because the colonel was like</v>

150
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:45.031
<v Speaker 1>this megalomaniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that hilarious that people are so </v>

151
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:47.791
<v Speaker 1>romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize that when you get to </v>

152
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>be Elvis famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are guaranteed fucking insane.</v>

153
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can get away from it.</v>

154
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Elvis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is back before the Internet is </v>

155
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean terrible movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was doing.</v>

157
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't even leave his house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even walk down the street.</v>

158
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.310
<v Speaker 4>When people would see him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would start screaming and fall to </v>

159
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.310
<v Speaker 4>their knees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

160
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 4>My favorite Elvis story that I heard was</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the height of everybody loving and </v>

161
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 4>hating Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those buttons came out.</v>

162
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Elvis,</v>

163
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 4>and then the I hate Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pins came out.</v>

164
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 4>He made those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The colonel came up with that.</v>

165
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 4>They sold more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate Elvis pins.</v>

166
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of a bunch of people doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that or stealing that exact same idea.</v>

167
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.270
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome that it's so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Elvis thing must be so sucky.</v>

168
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.280
<v Speaker 3>If you were a dude back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck do you compete with Elvis?</v>

169
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Your girl is screaming and yelling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking her and you know,</v>

170
00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:35.470
<v Speaker 3>she really would way rather be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alvin.</v>

171
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 4>All you can really do is just play into </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and just tell her you love Elvis and </v>

172
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 4>take her to elvis and like just try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make her elvis fantasy come to fruition.</v>

173
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put on the fucking wig.</v>

174
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 4>The whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mutton chops.</v>

175
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 4>It was elvis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an elvis clip when he was really.</v>

176
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 4>He was really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was doing whatever drugs he was doing</v>

177
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 4>and he was bored and he was not </v>
<v Speaker 4>remembering the lyrics and there's a Gig</v>

178
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 4>he was doing in Hawaii where he so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bored and you watch this.</v>

179
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.300
<v Speaker 4>He's not singing any of the lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>varieties just inside jokes with his </v>

180
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.111
<v Speaker 4>band members and then he does the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Re slowly backs up slowly during this </v>

181
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:11.441
<v Speaker 4>one song to his three backup singers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of the park he just turns </v>

182
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 4>and screams in their faces and scares </v>
<v Speaker 4>the shit out of them.</v>

183
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Like literally turns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes and they're all like,</v>

184
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 4>as they're trying to sing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was gone.</v>

185
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 4>He was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was way too big.</v>

186
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.070
<v Speaker 4>You can't get that big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

187
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 4>it's not safe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vague.</v>

188
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

189
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of a huge elvis fan and there's</v>

190
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.070
<v Speaker 4>one documentary that Priscilla actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>did years ago based on what she wrote </v>

191
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 4>where she finally talked about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>insecure he really wasn't,</v>

192
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had his buddies like living with them</v>

193
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:43.991
<v Speaker 4>and shit and if they wanted to go out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dinner and he was by himself and he </v>

194
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 4>would freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would shoot TV's up.</v>

195
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 4>He had to have his friends around him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four slash seven.</v>

196
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Have you joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>

199
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.370

<v Speaker 4>groups of people.</v>

200
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 4>You can't too problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you prefer that kind of.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

202
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.970

<v Speaker 3>guys that you're friends with that like </v>

203
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.690

204
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.430
<v Speaker 3>manage them all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes a pain in the ass.</v>

205
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 3>It becomes more of a pain in the ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>with getting my friends to get </v>

206
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.310
<v Speaker 3>downstairs in time so we can get to the </v>

<v Speaker 3>it became ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gonna become like,</v>

211
00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:31.030
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

212
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.020
<v Speaker 3>So I had to cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of it.</v>

213
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 3>It was like a reality show for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

214
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:35.920
<v Speaker 3>it was too much though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was too much like that.</v>

215
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:36.940
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was too many people,</v>

00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 4>a comedy troupe with Bob Kelly and him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Benny was so,</v>

235
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 4>it was a good comedy troupe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys were funny.</v>

236
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 4>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

237
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:30.951
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would do comedy sketches and then </v>

238
00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 4>you would do like each guy would go up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and do stand up.</v>

239
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we would work together.</v>

240
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 4>Do these addict already gigs.</v>

241
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Those were fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our sketch comedy Improv group was,</v>

242
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 4>was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were so bad at Improv and everybody,</v>

243
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first rule of Improv is don't deny,</v>

244
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 4>but we were so bad at Improv that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>first roles was denied,</v>

245
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 4>so we were just command and completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>ruined scenes by like you're pretending </v>

246
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 4>pantomiming I'm holding a baby and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be dude,</v>

247
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 4>why are you holding a tire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would just fall apart from there,</v>

248
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 4>but we just had a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys had some good ones.</v>

249
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 4>You had some good sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>

250
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was experimental.</v>

251
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.710
<v Speaker 4>It was like you guys are taking chances </v>
<v Speaker 4>who were doing something a little </v>

252
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.710
<v Speaker 4>unusual at a comedy club just when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were doing comedy too.</v>

253
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was probably actually better for us</v>

254
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:16.881
<v Speaker 4>opening with our standup and then we'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>just go fuck around and do music or </v>

255
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:16.881
<v Speaker 4>skits or Improv or whatever for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

256
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:16.881
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

257
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:21.830
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the hour to fill it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still ever tried to do improv and once </v>

258
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 4>in a while or do you just only stand up </v>
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>

259
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been bringing al because Al has </v>

260
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 4>been hosting down at the laugh factory </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll bring it up once in a while and</v>

261
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 4>we'll do stuff at the very end just to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

262
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.800
<v Speaker 4>whatever a skit or dumb and I will do </v>
<v Speaker 4>some stuff once in a while where I'll </v>

263
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 4>just bring them up and bad some stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>around but not like I used to not like,</v>

264
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sketch full on sketch upright citizens </v>

265
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:43.700
<v Speaker 4>brigade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

266
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:43.700
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

267
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a sketch guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really rather prefer watching standup.</v>

268
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean sketches are fun and everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

269
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:53.751
<v Speaker 4>But just remember that movie you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that little short movie did for Kelly </v>

270
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Kirsten where you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cable bill and stuff like that.</v>

271
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like a five minute clip or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

272
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.220
<v Speaker 4>I just pretended to be my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really easy.</v>

273
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.320
<v Speaker 4>How did it go from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to know because you </v>

274
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 4>were in Boston and you're the first guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who we watched go from,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did you turn the corner?</v>

<v Speaker 4>$100 total luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Complete.</v>

280
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Total luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

281
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 4>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did mtvs half hour comedy hour and MTV.</v>

282
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 4>Was that Mario Joiner or somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying yes and Mario would.</v>

283
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even get to shake his hand,</v>

284
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.240
<v Speaker 4>like he introduces you and he goes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the left and you go to the right.</v>

285
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

286
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:40.971
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get to shake my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it wasn't even really on a </v>

287
00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:40.971
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

288
00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like Mario joined her back then was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shit.</v>

289
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a guy where I don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened there.</v>

290
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The shit vanished.</v>

291
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Clark was the wholesale a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kamikaze or something like those guys.</v>

292
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 4>But I know Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he's troubled,</v>

293
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.010
<v Speaker 3>so I know that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would lead him to this weird place </v>

294
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.701
<v Speaker 3>he is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never understood the Mario Joiner </v>

295
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:02.701
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

296
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember Reggie Mcfadden?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do remember is another one,</v>

297
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam was a monster.</v>

298
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the few guys that I really would </v>

299
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 2>would be afraid to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

300
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.290
<v Speaker 3>I used to see him in the early nineties </v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York and I would watch him do </v>

301
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.290
<v Speaker 3>stand up and I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

302
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.570
<v Speaker 3>this guy's going to be Eddie Murphy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be gigantic.</v>

303
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.310
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be the biggest comic ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then nothing.</v>

304
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the weirdest thing ever as he stole</v>

305
00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

306
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Exactly that question right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

307
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:31.371
<v Speaker 3>And charismatic guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>handsome and well spoken and a fucking </v>

308
00:12:31.371 --> 00:12:33.450
<v Speaker 3>really nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real nice guy and whenever you're</v>

309
00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:34.800
<v Speaker 3>around him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always smiling,</v>

310
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.180
<v Speaker 3>having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

311
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.400
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does this not work?</v>

312
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.990
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange thing and it's a </v>

313
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.361
<v Speaker 3>very strange thing when guys get angry </v>
<v Speaker 3>that for some reason or another they </v>

314
00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:49.410
<v Speaker 3>don't get the respect that they deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of my pet peeves.</v>

315
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.690
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing when people do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

316
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Well it's because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

317
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak for Reggie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

318
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

319
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.640
<v Speaker 2>you go through this phase or period and </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup where you're like,</v>

320
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've committed my life to this.</v>

321
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 2>This is what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

322
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all in here at the table.</v>

323
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

324
00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:09.851
<v Speaker 2>my mid twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no turning back now and there's </v>

325
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:10.490
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of those years where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching people go on,</v>

326
00:13:10.491 --> 00:13:11.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are getting stuff,</v>

327
00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 2>some people are falling off and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaks you the hell out.</v>

328
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

329
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It freaks you out hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think it's a very healthy </v>

330
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.861
<v Speaker 3>attitude at all to look at someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else's success as if somehow or another </v>

331
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:23.861
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

332
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.100
<v Speaker 3>And I think if some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not,</v>

333
00:13:25.101 --> 00:13:30.101
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone's not paying attention to </v>

334
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:30.101
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of dudes that like,</v>

335
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:30.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like my,</v>

336
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:30.890
<v Speaker 3>my advocates or respect that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserves.</v>

337
00:13:30.891 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Like he gets the exact respect it </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserves.</v>

338
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the perfect connection between you </v>

339
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.020
<v Speaker 3>and an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's not getting a reaction,</v>

340
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.140
<v Speaker 3>it's because of one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either you've been very shitty and </v>

341
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.020
<v Speaker 3>marketing yourself and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or promoting yourself or your.</v>

342
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.860
<v Speaker 3>You're not seeing it the way other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are seeing it.</v>

343
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Speaker 3>You haven't found your audience and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that have weird acts</v>

344
00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:50.840
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

345
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Hedberg for the longest time had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard time on the road because he </v>

346
00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.341
<v Speaker 3>would go on and they would put on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>like super high energy middle acts that </v>

347
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:00.341
<v Speaker 3>would sing.</v>

348
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember there's this black dude in,</v>

349
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was in Ohio,</v>

350
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I think it was at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

351
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 3>the funny bone and Columbus and Hedberg </v>
<v Speaker 3>was supposed to headline and this guy </v>

352
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.980
<v Speaker 3>was fucking crushing air every night in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle spot with singing and dancing</v>

353
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:15.440
<v Speaker 3>and getting those Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio people into it.</v>

354
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And then Hedberg would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

355
00:14:17.061 --> 00:14:19.100
<v Speaker 3>your folks who's from there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

356
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.540
<v Speaker 3>it's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your peeps.</v>

357
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 3>They're good people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I recorded my special </v>

358
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he would,</v>

359
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.340
<v Speaker 3>he would go out to them and they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate him.</v>

360
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.290
<v Speaker 3>He would hate him.</v>

361
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.780
<v Speaker 2>What was he in that face to remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just grow up and kind of.</v>

362
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.950
<v Speaker 2>He would stand there for a while and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair were just completely be covering </v>

363
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 2>his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not even looking up the glasses,</v>

364
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just like the top of his head and</v>

365
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 2>how do you go up after somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking juggling chainsaws,</v>

366
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious by the way.</v>

367
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a weird thing,</v>

368
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:52.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a fine his audience and he had a </v>

369
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 3>real hard time with that a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's always a tricky thing,</v>

370
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're coming up in the beginning,</v>

371
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:59.651
<v Speaker 3>like there's guys who will tailor their </v>
<v Speaker 3>material or tailor their act where they </v>

372
00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they do it just so that they can get</v>

373
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 3>more people liking them and they can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on a better track.</v>

374
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.130
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's like a real.</v>

377
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:10.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to fucking.</v>

378
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience to really find your own voice.</v>

379
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so tricky because you know,</v>

380
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 3>you'll work at a club and if you offend </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

381

<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

382
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 3>my act was always kind of dirty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive and like,</v>

383
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was nobody,</v>

384
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 3>like they would get upset at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you just,</v>

385
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 3>there's three people that want their </v>
<v Speaker 3>money back,</v>

386
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 3>fucking asshole,</v>

390
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 3>this is the stuff that I always like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

391
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't talk about what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually funny.</v>

392
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.110
<v Speaker 4>So when you're doing your stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

393
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 4>you did finally leave Boston and hit the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road where,</v>

394
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 4>where did the news radio thing finally</v>

395
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 3>mtv thing and I got a development deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>right out of it with Fox to do a show </v>

396
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.610
<v Speaker 3>called hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This terrible shows really bad,</v>

397
00:15:48.611 --> 00:15:51.370
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of good guys on it and I had fun</v>

398
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:53.350
<v Speaker 3>but it was like I don't want to be run </v>
<v Speaker 3>actors and even when I'm like,</v>

399
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:58.351
<v Speaker 3>this is just to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would go back to New York and go </v>

400
00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:00.271
<v Speaker 3>back to comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I fucked up and already got an </v>

401
00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:00.271
<v Speaker 3>apartment because I thought the show was</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>

402
00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thinks their show is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go though the ratings are good.</v>

403
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.520
<v Speaker 3>Were picked up for next year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:08.521
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks that show is so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My stupid ass got this fucking cool ass </v>

405
00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:08.890
<v Speaker 3>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

406
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:09.850
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm stuck.</v>

407
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.300
<v Speaker 3>So then right after that I got a deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with NBC and before I know when I was on</v>

408
00:16:13.301 --> 00:16:18.301
<v Speaker 3>news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like stumbled into one </v>

409
00:16:18.301 --> 00:16:18.301

<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

411
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.570
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of funny because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why they liked me for the part </v>

412
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.230
<v Speaker 3>was that there was no jokes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>script.</v>

413

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

416
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.470

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.410
<v Speaker 2>on this car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be the fucking craziest.</v>

465
00:18:29.411 --> 00:18:34.411
<v Speaker 2>Got the best car ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really ended up being the worst </v>

466
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:34.411
<v Speaker 2>thing that I ever bought with my money.</v>

467
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the exact same story with Porsche </v>

468
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought a nine slash 11 turbo and it </v>

469
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.521
<v Speaker 3>broke down on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally broke down where it needed a </v>

470
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:44.521
<v Speaker 3>tow truck five times in three years.</v>

471
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 4>I think I drove you three times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did I dealer?</v>

472
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:48.690
<v Speaker 4>Just me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've spent A.</v>

473
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I was there like nine different that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were complaining to the fucking crap.</v>

474
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 4>The crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Lexus</v>

475
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 3>never fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

476
00:18:57.711 --> 00:18:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Never fucked a bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

477
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make them so well.</v>

478
00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:05.591
<v Speaker 3>There's never any problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a Mercedes or a porsche </v>

479
00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have some weird light </v>

480
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 3>goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

481
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't working.</v>

482
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Why is my headlights not coming on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

483
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.850
<v Speaker 3>You got to bring it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Close the computer and I bought one in </v>

484
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:15.850
<v Speaker 3>windows 95 on those things.</v>

485
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 2>The Aston Martin and then I bought the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Casino Royale Soundtrack.</v>

486
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Can I just fucking drove up and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretended I was a spy.</v>

487
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:29.330
<v Speaker 4>He was pointing at people on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the road and pretending I was shooting </v>

488
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.891
<v Speaker 4>them and like too much time on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands is a problem with those cards is </v>

489
00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:34.210
<v Speaker 4>when they work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're intoxicating.</v>

490
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.840
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you hear the sound of the engine,</v>

491
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 4>that fucking powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like well engineered engine,</v>

492
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.920
<v Speaker 4>but it was such a poorly crafted car </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside that.</v>

493
00:19:44.921 --> 00:19:47.020
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't I just get a fucking ring tone</v>

494
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 4>of that sound and be happy with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking side of the engine and get rid </v>

495
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.280
<v Speaker 4>of this plastic piece of shit ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything inside was crap.</v>

496
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.720
<v Speaker 4>It's in an English car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

497
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've never been known for really </v>

498
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.160
<v Speaker 4>making great cars mean Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

499
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the engine,</v>

500
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was worth a fuck up to before Ford </v>

501
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 4>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

502
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

503
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.720
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>English.</v>

504
00:20:07.721 --> 00:20:09.340
<v Speaker 4>You don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want Japanese.</v>

505
00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.500
<v Speaker 4>They don't fuck a product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Problem is.</v>

506
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything's made by robots </v>
<v Speaker 4>now for the most part,</v>

507
00:20:14.711 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 4>so even American made by the same robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not the same though.</v>

508
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.540
<v Speaker 4>It's the standards that you engineered.</v>

509
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what's important and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

510
00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:26.170
<v Speaker 3>They're using much higher standards than</v>
<v Speaker 3>American car companies are.</v>

511
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.250
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a Ford Mustang and I have a BMW m</v>

512
00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:35.251
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the difference between them is so </v>

513
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:37.381
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Ford as high level as far as </v>

514
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:37.381
<v Speaker 3>American cars go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better than gm,</v>

515
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:38.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're inside of it.</v>

516
00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 3>It just feels fucking Chincy and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel goofy and they don't.</v>

517
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.700
<v Speaker 3>The navigation system kind of sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like is engineered by an American</v>

518
00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 3>guy and was just kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the Lexis,</v>

519
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:50.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

520
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's fucking do this.</v>

521
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Modern complained about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How sad also had the cast of all time </v>

522
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.630
<v Speaker 3>we've had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had</v>

523
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.670
<v Speaker 4>nothing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the thing is you can </v>

524
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.381
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can sit here and you can tell these </v>

525
00:21:06.381 --> 00:21:06.870
<v Speaker 4>stories if you've been fortunate enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have some success because anybody who</v>

526
00:21:06.871 --> 00:21:09.540
<v Speaker 4>knows who's done this for a living when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bad,</v>

527
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.390
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it's empty.</v>

528
00:21:12.391 --> 00:21:14.040
<v Speaker 4>It is at its emptiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

529
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.350
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a little something or you have a</v>

530
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.360
<v Speaker 4>few years of fond that I think it's to</v>

531
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.590
<v Speaker 3>cool to be able to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem real to me.</v>

532
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>success and money.</v>

533
00:21:21.331 --> 00:21:22.800
<v Speaker 3>None of it seems real to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

534
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.660
<v Speaker 3>when I can go to the store and just buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

535
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>

536
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.970
<v Speaker 3>that TV looks like it would be perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

537
00:21:26.971 --> 00:21:31.971
<v Speaker 3>Let's just get this thing and it can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of plastic and you give me </v>

538
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:31.971
<v Speaker 3>whatever you got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

539
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never real.</v>

540
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.950
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy fake,</v>

541
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.650
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it say I to walk around your </v>
<v Speaker 3>house?</v>

542
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I do I'll walk around my house </v>

543
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.340
<v Speaker 3>high and I'll just look at the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just call.</v>

544
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.900
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

545
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.640
<v Speaker 3>this is my house is where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is so strange.</v>

546
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Like why you think about what it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you first started making money</v>

547
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:54.600
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't have to worry about bills</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

548
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feeling.</v>

549
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the fucking most liberating </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling ever.</v>

550
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the big feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not being famous,</v>

551
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:05.931
<v Speaker 3>not being rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The liberating feeling is not have to </v>

552
00:22:05.931 --> 00:22:06.120
<v Speaker 3>worry about paying your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important one.</v>

553
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.950
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

554
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.810
<v Speaker 3>It was like all of a sudden it just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifted.</v>

555
00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I literally physically felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighter.</v>

556
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget it because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>always scratch and it was always like,</v>

557
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.210
<v Speaker 3>do this John Schuler Gig and maybe I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>have enough money for rent and then you </v>

558
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.700
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't eat tonight because I,</v>

559
00:22:20.701 --> 00:22:22.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally don't have any money.</v>

560
00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I have to wait until tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my check cleared.</v>

561
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

562
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Down still owes you a of chats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was the big one especially imagined.</v>

563
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

564
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 4>He still owes me 300 bucks from one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

565
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.650
<v Speaker 4>Really those,</v>

566
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.790
<v Speaker 3>that was brutal for people that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what we're talking about.</v>

567
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:42.791
<v Speaker 3>There was a time where there was another</v>
<v Speaker 3>entity that he had called New York </v>

568
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:42.791
<v Speaker 3>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

569
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:46.010
<v Speaker 3>And they were booking colleges and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently it was costing too much money</v>

570
00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:51.011
<v Speaker 3>to rent the building where they were at </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were spending more money than </v>

571
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:54.311
<v Speaker 3>they were making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they started spending the comedians </v>

572
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:54.740
<v Speaker 3>money and owing it to literally like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

573
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.240
<v Speaker 3>you would go to the Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would fly around the country.</v>

574
00:22:57.241 --> 00:22:59.210
<v Speaker 3>You go to these colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your checks,</v>

575
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.330
<v Speaker 3>send them into Barre and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would wait and then you build like a</v>

576
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.640
<v Speaker 3>month later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

577
00:23:04.641 --> 00:23:06.080
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's my money?</v>

578
00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:11.081
<v Speaker 3>This is getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it would be like another time </v>

579

<v Speaker 3>but it was ugly.</v>

582
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.860
<v Speaker 3>It didn't</v>

583

<v Speaker 4>and people,</v>

588
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 4>some people know this or don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I hired my step brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my half brother.</v>

590
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

591
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>

592
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.410
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I thought I had this great nest egg.</v>

593
00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I bought a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did all that.</v>

594
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 4>And then he</v>

595
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 2>came in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk too much about.</v>

596
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

597
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.680
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna be talking about it since </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

598
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:54.460
<v Speaker 3>So the rumor is you don't have to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that he stole like $11,000,000</v>

599
00:23:54.461 --> 00:23:56.440
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking hard.</v>

600
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Five years you think that your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>

601
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.920
<v Speaker 3>your beloved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone you grow up with is so </v>

602
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.041
<v Speaker 3>fucking jealous and so shifty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>plotting against you that they'll steal </v>

603
00:24:08.041 --> 00:24:09.400
<v Speaker 3>your fucking money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>

604
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.130
<v Speaker 3>allegedly had been such a betrayal.</v>

605
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

606
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

607
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 2>absolutely complete betrayal and the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deal with that with my family,</v>

608
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:24.340
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that really was jarring in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best possible ways was talking </v>

609
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when everything happened,</v>

613
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I started in 1990 and then I looked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

616
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I went back on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did probably the biggest tour that I,</v>

617
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll ever do last year I did 80 arenas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was promoting my fans came out and it </v>

621
00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:51.011
<v Speaker 2>was that I haven't had a moment in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years.</v>

622

626
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 2>came out and support it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was that moment where I'm going,</v>

00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:54.370
<v Speaker 3>shit out of nowhere and destroys and </v>

648
00:25:59.400 --> 00:25:59.400

652
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.070

<v Speaker 2>line that starts to come through and </v>

<v Speaker 2>there nothing better in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man</v>

655
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.800
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right from the bat,</v>

<v Speaker 3>new shit.</v>

660
00:26:20.341 --> 00:26:25.341

<v Speaker 3>make sure you get through the set good </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just just do this stuff that you</v>

<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

683
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>this is not an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was fucking squeaky clean.</v>

684
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every now and then he said,</v>

689
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 3>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would watch his economy of words,</v>

690
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 3>the way he set a sentence up and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would just feel humbled.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a master,</v>

693
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.040

<v Speaker 3>thing where there's all these great guys</v>

694
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 3>in this one area and they always drew a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd and they always got paid well,</v>

695
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.160
<v Speaker 3>and then they would go on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be nobody's.</v>

696
00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would it be a fucking nobody?</v>

697
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 3>We've got a about back in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>

698
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:49.131
<v Speaker 3>they're back in Boston and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the same gigs over and over again </v>

699
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:51.831
<v Speaker 3>when everybody else takes a shot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>branches off and disappears and becomes </v>

700
00:27:51.831 --> 00:27:51.831
<v Speaker 3>famous</v>

701
00:27:51.831 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 4>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you really would watch these guys </v>

702
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:55.790
<v Speaker 4>and part of you would feel bad that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't getting over the hump,</v>

703
00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:00.200
<v Speaker 4>but you felt like so fucking honored to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be opening up and standing,</v>

704
00:28:00.201 --> 00:28:02.060
<v Speaker 4>watching going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm learning from the best.</v>

705
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.020
<v Speaker 4>When you leave Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you had that.</v>

706
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:11.290
<v Speaker 4>These were guys like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always describe it like they had the </v>

707
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:11.290
<v Speaker 4>energy of showman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were like men.</v>

708
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.650
<v Speaker 4>They were men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doing comedy?</v>

709
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.640
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

710
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.570
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

711
00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:19.571
<v Speaker 4>I always really wanted to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They always stood right at the fucking </v>

712
00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:20.390
<v Speaker 4>front of the stage or re Lenny Clarke is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the perfect example of that.</v>

713
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 3>When Lenny's a fucking man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy.</v>

714
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.280
<v Speaker 3>This is what Lindy Clark said was we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were at giggles and Sagas and there was </v>

715
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 3>this fucking table full of chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't shut the fuck up.</v>

716
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.320
<v Speaker 3>They were screaming and yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

717
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't shut the fuck up,</v>

718
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hire a Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you in front of your mother.</v>

719
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did he just say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and it was me.</v>

720
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I think Chris Mcguire was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was me and Chris.</v>

721
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:47.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember if we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did he just say?</v>

722
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.810
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddy Clark did not give a fuck.</v>

723
00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Speaker 3>He was just this big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic burly guy who would,</v>

724
00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:01.070
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would beat your ass to who this is </v>

725
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 3>like if you like talk shit to Lenny car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll probably,</v>

726
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a line and punch in the face.</v>

727
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.950
<v Speaker 4>These were real like real hardcore blue </v>
<v Speaker 4>collar guys,</v>

728
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 4>but layering area.</v>

729
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 3>It made us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It made us sharper because you were held</v>

730
00:29:12.111 --> 00:29:15.800
<v Speaker 3>up to a much higher standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to go on after guys who were way</v>

731
00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:19.160
<v Speaker 3>better than average and you had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to be sharp all the time.</v>

732
00:29:19.161 --> 00:29:24.161
<v Speaker 3>You had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to constantly reassess your </v>

733
00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:24.161
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

734
00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:26.330
<v Speaker 4>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned a lot watching joe before us </v>

735
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 4>because the thing that happened with you</v>
<v Speaker 4>though was you were the first guy that I</v>

736
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:31.740
<v Speaker 4>saw from the next young generation that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you started headlining,</v>

737
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 4>you were getting the respect for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for killing,</v>

738
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.860
<v Speaker 4>but you were the first guy that I saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>that had real backlash ever in my life </v>

739
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 4>that people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know how to,</v>

740
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 4>where to put them and people that he'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed.</v>

741
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not going to mention names,</v>

742
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:50.431
<v Speaker 4>but like they were just so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrated and they didn't know how to </v>

743
00:29:50.431 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 4>deal with like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

746
00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 3>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

747
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.690
<v Speaker 3>people are always going to resent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're young.</v>

748
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Good looking in every fucking chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crowd after the show is just like,</v>

749
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that,</v>

750
00:30:02.851 --> 00:30:05.220
<v Speaker 3>there's the fighting thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

751
00:30:05.221 --> 00:30:10.221
<v Speaker 3>It's not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not supposed to coincide </v>

752
00:30:10.221 --> 00:30:10.221
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The martial arts thing,</v>

753
00:30:10.221 --> 00:30:11.220
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the,</v>

754
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in the club.</v>

755
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean that's what it felt like to </v>

756
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.761
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are always going to be backlash </v>

757
00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:19.761
<v Speaker 3>when whenever anyone successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to tell you that.</v>

758
00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't fight,</v>

759
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.700
<v Speaker 3>which makes it even tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

760
00:30:23.701 --> 00:30:27.300
<v Speaker 3>people are always looking for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why you're fucked up when you are</v>

761
00:30:27.301 --> 00:30:32.301
<v Speaker 3>more successful than them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always looking for some reason </v>

762
00:30:32.301 --> 00:30:32.301
<v Speaker 3>why it's them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

796
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:55.420
<v Speaker 3>see anybody ever forgiven for anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they might have done in the past,</v>

797
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you watch that?</v>

811
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Like all these stars on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five stars.</v>

813
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to rotten tomatoes.</v>

814
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:34.411
<v Speaker 3>I should've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a Coen brothers movie too and I </v>

815
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:34.411
<v Speaker 3>love the Coen brothers and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting parts in it,</v>

816
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 3>but there was a part of the and where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

817
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ended.</v>

818
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Speaker 3>It just ended it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

819
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:41.200
<v Speaker 3>now the movie's over out of nowhere were</v>
<v Speaker 3>way worse than this.</v>

820
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.460

<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>

822
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

823
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know these characters.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

854
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.490

<v Speaker 4>up too much time.</v>

855
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Not like a once in a while I'll still do</v>
<v Speaker 4>like call of duty or something,</v>

856
00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:56.541

<v Speaker 4>first met.</v>

864
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.120
<v Speaker 4>That's how we met and bonded before the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he told me he had,</v>

869
00:34:23.591 --> 00:34:25.390
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't have the money for at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

<v Speaker 4>anyway when I first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I jumped on with Joe once while I'm </v>

875

<v Speaker 4>He just not even destroyed.</v>

878
00:34:49.751 --> 00:34:50.830
<v Speaker 4>It was not even fun.</v>

879
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just bad.</v>

880
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:55.780
<v Speaker 4>It was like beyond rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

881
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.030
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll do like kill me like 99 times in a</v>

882
00:34:58.031 --> 00:35:03.031
<v Speaker 4>row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think I killed you once </v>

883
00:35:03.031 --> 00:35:03.031
<v Speaker 4>maybe like three hour period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

884
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only would joe be plasma rifling me </v>

885
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.030
<v Speaker 4>up my ass like every other hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I'd hear through his whatever </v>

886
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:16.591
<v Speaker 4>the headset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he'd be doing something else which </v>

887
00:35:16.591 --> 00:35:16.591
<v Speaker 4>made it even fucking worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

888
00:35:16.591 --> 00:35:20.941
<v Speaker 4>I could tell he was not even completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>focused and sweating and doing that </v>

889
00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:25.711
<v Speaker 4>thing where I'm like trying to sound </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not fucking raging on a good </v>

890
00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:25.711
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

891
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Turn off the Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

892
00:35:27.551 --> 00:35:28.600
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

893
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Quake is one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those</v>

894
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those who don't know it,</v>

895
00:35:31.521 --> 00:35:36.521
<v Speaker 3>it's a first person shooter where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>running down these three deed mazes and </v>

896
00:35:36.521 --> 00:35:40.261
<v Speaker 3>you have all these different gun options</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of those games that relies </v>

897
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:43.821
<v Speaker 3>very heavily on playing it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the mouse and the keyboard literally </v>

898
00:35:43.821 --> 00:35:47.841
<v Speaker 3>become like an extension of your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can get it to do what you want </v>

899
00:35:47.841 --> 00:35:50.871
<v Speaker 3>it to do because you're so comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the movements you don't think </v>

900
00:35:50.871 --> 00:35:50.871
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

901
00:35:50.871 --> 00:35:53.931
<v Speaker 3>it's w a s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>d use the keys to move backward and </v>

902
00:35:53.931 --> 00:35:53.931
<v Speaker 3>straight side to side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't think about it,</v>

903
00:35:53.931 --> 00:35:58.430
<v Speaker 3>just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I'm going to the right </v>

904
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.471
<v Speaker 3>when I go to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking to the right now as I'm </v>

905
00:36:00.471 --> 00:36:00.471
<v Speaker 3>thinking my fingers and moving and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get totally sinked up with it.</v>

906
00:36:00.471 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 3>You have to do it like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 hours a day to day.</v>

907
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 3>So I was obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go online,</v>

908
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:10.971
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like having conversations </v>

909
00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:13.101
<v Speaker 3>with my check and I'd be thinking I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be playing quake right now </v>

910
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:13.101
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would have to pretend that I wanted</v>

911
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:15.450
<v Speaker 3>to see a movie with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a complete junkie.</v>

912
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.480
<v Speaker 4>What was weird is that you are really </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive with the game where like I </v>

913
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.871
<v Speaker 4>would just hide in the toilet paper roll</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the unreal bathroom map and just sit </v>

914
00:36:23.871 --> 00:36:25.400
<v Speaker 4>there and snipe people where you're more</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kill every number.</v>

915
00:36:25.401 --> 00:36:25.790
<v Speaker 4>Second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

916
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

917
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.720
<v Speaker 3>my leftover martial arts days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still some work to be done in </v>

918
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.471
<v Speaker 3>the back of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just fucking just running down </v>

919
00:36:35.471 --> 00:36:35.471
<v Speaker 3>hallways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting people.</v>

920
00:36:35.471 --> 00:36:36.410
<v Speaker 3>This thing is so satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fun.</v>

921
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.440
<v Speaker 4>I remember it was over when I was at </v>
<v Speaker 4>fry's electronics try to buy like shit </v>

922
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.620
<v Speaker 4>that I've been thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

923
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 4>is there a mouse that has every button </v>
<v Speaker 4>already on?</v>

924
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:50.211
<v Speaker 4>Like what can I do to fucking guys never</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat me.</v>

925
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.730
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's would do the same thing that I did</v>

<v Speaker 3>but every now and then you run into like</v>

928
00:36:56.151 --> 00:37:01.151
<v Speaker 3>a Chinese virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some 13 year old kid who doesn't give a </v>

<v Speaker 3>and do deserve rape me.</v>

931
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.660

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

932
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was good.</v>

933
00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Guys would go down and interview with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rail guns.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Impossible shots.</v>

<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

937
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.240
<v Speaker 3>some guys are just just on another level</v>

938
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:24.110
<v Speaker 4>and now kids have all the modded </v>
<v Speaker 4>controllers and I'm just using a regular</v>

939
00:37:24.111 --> 00:37:24.740
<v Speaker 4>controller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

940
00:37:24.741 --> 00:37:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to have the advantage </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

941
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 4>They've got like these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

942
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever wolf pack fucking sticks and </v>

943
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:32.500
<v Speaker 4>it's like nine</v>

944
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:32.500
<v Speaker 3>deal with the console,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

945
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:36.940
<v Speaker 3>the console is just not as precise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they did a thing with a Microsoft </v>

946
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:41.111
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a competition between console </v>

947
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:41.111
<v Speaker 3>guys against a</v>

948
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:41.111
<v Speaker 4>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bass guys yet.</v>

949
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:43.090
<v Speaker 4>But you would never play that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get used to the point.</v>

950
00:37:43.091 --> 00:37:45.790
<v Speaker 4>If everyone's doing the same controller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everyone's on the same page,</v>

951
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 3>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the same controller isn't as </v>

952
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 3>precise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you use that controller?</v>

953
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

954
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.250
<v Speaker 4>When you got another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get really good at it.</v>

955
00:37:51.251 --> 00:37:52.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't get as good,</v>

956
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For what you like to play your kind of </v>

957
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.131
<v Speaker 4>first instruction side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to have the most connection </v>

958
00:38:01.121 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 4>between you and what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how fun it is to get on your ex boss.</v>

959
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:04.120
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Carla Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See is playing call of duty.</v>

961
00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Let's kill him a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

962
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.850
<v Speaker 3>it's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever kill him?</v>

963
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I played him once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

964
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he any good?</v>

965
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.410
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really kick his ass.</v>

966
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was more just like watching </v>

967
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:19.460
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

968
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I hang out in the toilet paper because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a video game foyer.</v>

969
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I went to his website the other day for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something because I.</v>

970
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.540
<v Speaker 3>every now and then I'd like to read his </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and go,</v>

971
00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:31.190
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so strange.</v>

972
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:36.470
<v Speaker 3>So I went to his website and it said one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most feared in the country.</v>

973
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.360
<v Speaker 3>That's like on his bio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the front of his book.</v>

974
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 3>He's the punisher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most feared.</v>

975
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A crazy thought.</v>

976
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 3>You talk about the wrong psychology for </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

977
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 3>one of the most feared you want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>feared comedian.</v>

978
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that even really mean?</v>

979
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 3>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you collect comics?</v>

980
00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:01.020
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about Carlton will be </v>

981
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.020
<v Speaker 3>changing gears like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

982
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about someone completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

983
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know what that means.</v>

984
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:08.050
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to be a feared comic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

985
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrible way of thinking.</v>

986
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 3>You want people to fear you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to fear you?</v>

987
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:13.980
<v Speaker 3>The audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedians.</v>

988
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he likes to do,</v>

989
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:20.371
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talked about it on the mark baron </v>

990
00:39:20.371 --> 00:39:20.371
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was really fascinating that</v>

991
00:39:20.371 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 3>he used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he called back,</v>

992
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.260
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he went,</v>

993
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>he went in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of,</v>

994
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's weird?</v>

995
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Marin was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very strange.</v>

996
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:28.790
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

997
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand why Marin didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that he's completely insane.</v>

998
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Causes like gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like bipolar or something,</v>

999
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:36.150
<v Speaker 3>like there's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>

1000
00:39:36.151 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you started talking about,</v>

1001

<v Speaker 3>what was it exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but they read his shit and are they saw </v>

1011
00:40:04.441 --> 00:40:04.441
<v Speaker 3>him perform and they didn't kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1012
00:40:04.441 --> 00:40:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1013
00:40:04.941 --> 00:40:06.190

<v Speaker 3>giving them room and he was talking </v>

1015
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.020
<v Speaker 3>about how he would go onstage in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of guys on purpose to make them feel bad</v>

1016
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 3>that he would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1017
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:20.011
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he talked about how he did it to </v>

1018
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:21.000
<v Speaker 3>mark Marin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about how he did it to a.</v>

1019
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.620
<v Speaker 3>what's that dude's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Steve Trevino.</v>

1020
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 3>First Time Steve Trevino ever got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>headline,</v>

1021
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Carlos went on right before them and did</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an hour,</v>

1022
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 3>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>45 minutes or something crazy.</v>

1023
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 3>But when he was talking about he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he comes like he's paint that.</v>

1024
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.360
<v Speaker 3>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that's associated with </v>

1025
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:39.670
<v Speaker 3>this fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to manage what I had to do.</v>

1026
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:41.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like,</v>

1027
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's broken legit,</v>

1028
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.330
<v Speaker 3>sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it doesn't.</v>

1029
00:40:46.331 --> 00:40:51.331
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't feel emotions way everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else does and I don't think he feels </v>

1030
00:40:51.331 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 3>when he's hurt either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got like this weird block going on.</v>

1031
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:58.650
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're talking about my brother </v>

1032
00:40:58.650 --> 00:40:58.650
<v Speaker 3>and I think we're talking about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1033
00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:03.080
<v Speaker 3>There was a book written recently called</v>
<v Speaker 3>the enemy amongst us or something like </v>

1034
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.211
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something along those lines and it was </v>

1035
00:41:06.211 --> 00:41:07.981
<v Speaker 3>all about sociopath's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how many people amongst us really </v>

1036
00:41:07.981 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 3>don't feel emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just pretend they do to fit in,</v>

1037
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 3>but they don't fear the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their actions.</v>

1038
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:13.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't worry about hurting other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's feelings.</v>

1039
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.340
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>

1040
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You have to be sensitive.</v>

1048
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 3>You have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be insecure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you that wants attention so badly that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's willing to go through those early </v>

1051
00:41:37.651 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 3>days because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not fucked up,</v>

1052
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:44.021
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find something better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to find something that doesn't </v>

<v Speaker 3>willing to get through the bombing.</v>

1056
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1057
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:53.240

<v Speaker 2>because I was like the complete,</v>

1058
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 2>not only introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always like,</v>

1059
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I had like anxiety and social anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still really do.</v>

1060
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because I can do huge fucking</v>

1061
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 2>arenas if the meet and greets 10 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>

1063
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 2>But in high school was really bad and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember feeling like that,</v>

1064
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first time I got a laugh that light</v>

1065
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 2>broke up a moment and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1066
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:18.900
<v Speaker 2>that's the fucking weapon right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want people to fear my comedy wants.</v>

1067
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.260
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1068
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.700
<v Speaker 3>My first one I did out of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this really shitty math teacher </v>

1069
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.710
<v Speaker 3>who was always mean and she would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1070
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.840
<v Speaker 3>just treat you like you're really dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he didn't understand things and she </v>

1071
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.250
<v Speaker 3>was a black lady and she was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this thing on stage or on the,</v>

1072
00:42:32.251 --> 00:42:37.251
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage she was doing this thing in </v>

1073
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:37.251
<v Speaker 3>front of a chalkboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was writing something down.</v>

1074
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't paying attention and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Rogan,</v>

1075
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.820
<v Speaker 3>would you like to come up here and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>both of these questions for the class?</v>

1076
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you like me to do both of those </v>

1077
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:47.340
<v Speaker 3>questions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody went fucking crazy.</v>

1078
00:42:47.341 --> 00:42:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Like tubes could not help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just don't laugh in.</v>

1079
00:42:49.891 --> 00:42:52.560
<v Speaker 3>And people slamming books down and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>she kicked me out.</v>

1080
00:42:52.561 --> 00:42:57.561
<v Speaker 3>I got sent home for the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember thinking at that moment </v>

1081
00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:57.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

1082
00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:57.561

00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1084
00:42:57.871 --> 00:42:59.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the soundtrack starts,</v>

1085
00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1087
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:02.810
<v Speaker 2>After that it was like,</v>

1088
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.370
<v Speaker 3>she's being mean to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:43:05.371 --> 00:43:10.371
<v Speaker 3>it was like an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shut her down in front of everybody </v>

1090
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:10.371
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Dan,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that was my first heckle,</v>

1092
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I just remember skipping school one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was at Brigham's Brigham's sure.</v>

1095
00:43:19.961 --> 00:43:22.120
<v Speaker 2>the house dean came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll say,</v>

1096
00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:25.330
<v Speaker 2>just sat in front of me like I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>busted and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1102
00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I know school's not for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that theater and you know,</v>

1103
00:43:35.681 --> 00:43:37.300
<v Speaker 2>making people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of caught up now.</v>

1104
00:43:37.301 --> 00:43:38.830
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what you should do.</v>

1105
00:43:38.831 --> 00:43:43.831
<v Speaker 2>I know you wanted to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you should do first person </v>

1106
00:43:43.831 --> 00:43:43.831
<v Speaker 2>to ever tell me you should do that.</v>

1107
00:43:43.831 --> 00:43:45.340
<v Speaker 3>So nice to have someone there to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1108
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had anybody telling me that.</v>

1109
00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Everybody told me I sucked my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my own mom told me she didn't think I </v>

1110
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.350
<v Speaker 3>should go into comedy because I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>very funny.</v>

1111
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more of a mom protecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

00:44:54.651 --> 00:44:55.650
<v Speaker 4>actually makes them funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking interesting.</v>

1138
00:45:02.871 --> 00:45:02.871
<v Speaker 3>should be perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just they want,</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to be funny.</v>

1141
00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:12.381
<v Speaker 3>It's like the connection between them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the audience is so distant and </v>

1142
00:45:12.381 --> 00:45:14.340

1144
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 3>be able to be yourself and get onstage </v>

1147
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:29.180
<v Speaker 3>way that a lot of people aren't covered.</v>

1151
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.760

<v Speaker 3>You can't be on pretending to not give a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck like you have to have mastered it </v>

1156
00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:51.821
<v Speaker 3>to enough where you've understood the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and you've assessed it and </v>

1157
00:45:51.821 --> 00:45:55.631
<v Speaker 3>you'd been objective about the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between the EU and the </v>

1158
00:45:55.631 --> 00:45:58.901
<v Speaker 3>audience over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many times that you will completely </v>

1159
00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:01.871
<v Speaker 3>mastered it and then you're comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the experience and then only then </v>

1160
00:46:01.871 --> 00:46:02.660
<v Speaker 3>can you go up there and just be yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fuck around and be funny.</v>

1161
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But until you hit that vibe,</v>

1162
00:46:04.341 --> 00:46:06.050
<v Speaker 3>that one groove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1163
00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:07.730
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just go out there going,</v>

1164
00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:08.870
<v Speaker 3>clunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clunk,</v>

1165
00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.560
<v Speaker 3>clunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please love me.</v>

1166
00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can I do to make a connection with </v>

1167
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:18.340
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get it like little bits or touch</v>

1168
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't grab you and hug you.</v>

1169
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning days like every now and</v>

1170
00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:24.230
<v Speaker 3>then you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you your crack like one bit.</v>

1171
00:46:24.231 --> 00:46:24.950
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1172
00:46:24.951 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 3>it has a something there and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would laugh.</v>

1173
00:46:27.561 --> 00:46:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think there's something there.</v>

1174
00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm touching.</v>

1175
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.440
<v Speaker 3>There's gold under here and we'd keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>digging.</v>

1176
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

1177
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Listen to yourself a lot like you record</v>
<v Speaker 4>your sets and I really,</v>

1178
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:40.820
<v Speaker 4>I never used to until I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1179
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:44.210
<v Speaker 4>you make cds and then you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is brutal.</v>

1180
00:46:44.211 --> 00:46:46.400
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I remember listening to the first</v>

1181
00:46:46.401 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 4>cd and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1182
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:51.980
<v Speaker 4>at that point in my life there was no </v>
<v Speaker 4>real drama in my life.</v>

1183
00:46:51.981 --> 00:46:54.500
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing dramatic about my life.</v>

1184
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:59.710
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty easy going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of my first stuff was very </v>

1185
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.460
<v Speaker 4>nostalgic and very kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the stuff I grew up with.</v>

1186
00:47:01.461 --> 00:47:02.420
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>

1187
00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.200
<v Speaker 4>That's what I knew and as I listened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was like,</v>

1188
00:47:06.201 --> 00:47:06.830
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two things.</v>

1189
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:08.600
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I listened to myself,</v>

1190
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:13.070
<v Speaker 4>like I would say 40 percent of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no words.</v>

1191
00:47:13.071 --> 00:47:16.520
<v Speaker 4>It was just physicality and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I started really getting passionate</v>

1192
00:47:16.521 --> 00:47:18.620
<v Speaker 4>about vernacular and wanting to build up</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1193
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:21.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>language and paint better stories with,</v>

1194
00:47:21.561 --> 00:47:23.540
<v Speaker 4>with words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not only that,</v>

1195
00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:28.541
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started having things happened in my </v>

1196
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:31.661
<v Speaker 4>life and my personal life with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with my folks that really </v>

1197
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:31.661
<v Speaker 4>were</v>

1198
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:31.661
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1199
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:35.370
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a kid anymore who just goes up </v>

1200
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:35.370
<v Speaker 2>and talks about fucking or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1201
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Frat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1202
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 2>kind of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking.</v>

1203
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have real issues,</v>

1204
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:42.961
<v Speaker 2>real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now how do I turn a corner and how </v>

1205
00:47:42.961 --> 00:47:42.961
<v Speaker 2>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1206
00:47:42.961 --> 00:47:46.310
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while to be able to not </v>

1207
00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.480
<v Speaker 2>reinvent but like how to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metamorphosis onstage with truth and </v>

1208
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>light where you're at in your life.</v>

1209
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I feel that all the criticism that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've gotten,</v>

1210
00:47:51.571 --> 00:47:54.240
<v Speaker 3>and I can see this for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the criticism that I've gotten,</v>

1211
00:47:54.241 --> 00:47:58.530
<v Speaker 3>even the stuff that hurts and even the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that was wrong and just hurtful,</v>

1212
00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:04.190
<v Speaker 3>it helps me absolutely improved me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the Douche bags of improved me </v>

1213
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.810
<v Speaker 3>because it's made me look at myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>through their eyes and go,</v>

1214
00:48:06.811 --> 00:48:08.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they have a point?</v>

1215
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about me that's offensive to </v>

1216
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.471
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about me that they don't </v>

1217
00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:15.471
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:15.471
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you see it and you go,</v>

1219
00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:15.471
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1220
00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:19.791
<v Speaker 3>I can see how maybe I'm being kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Douchey or like I've had bits from my </v>

1221
00:48:19.791 --> 00:48:24.351
<v Speaker 3>old CD's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I w I would like to go back and change </v>

1222
00:48:24.351 --> 00:48:24.351
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1223
00:48:24.351 --> 00:48:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want that being represented</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a representative of my thinking.</v>

1224
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any specials that air and people just </v>

1225
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:30.540
<v Speaker 3>discover you and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1226
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.270
<v Speaker 3>is that what you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to England a lot and I love it over</v>

1227
00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:35.100
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had an old bit about just shitting</v>

1228
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:40.101
<v Speaker 3>on England of fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like other women are disgusting </v>

1229
00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:40.620
<v Speaker 3>and it was just a mean bit for no </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

1230
00:48:40.621 --> 00:48:43.650
<v Speaker 3>I just met a couple of English people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like his this crazy bit,</v>

1231
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.620
<v Speaker 3>but now it's like I want to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really think that way anymore.</v>

1232
00:48:46.621 --> 00:48:47.820
<v Speaker 3>This is just douchey shit.</v>

1233
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely looked back.</v>

1234
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.750
<v Speaker 2>No regrets because everything builds you</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to where you're at,</v>

1235
00:48:51.751 --> 00:48:53.730
<v Speaker 2>but for me when it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1236
00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I finally hit a crossed over and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I knew I had a moment where I</v>

1237
00:48:58.671 --> 00:48:59.370
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1238
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.430
<v Speaker 2>what all the Djs in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really talking about me.</v>

1239
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in trouble.</v>

1240
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what I really battened down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatches and I was like,</v>

1241
00:49:06.451 --> 00:49:11.451
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what two years from now I know </v>

1242
00:49:11.451 --> 00:49:13.581
<v Speaker 2>the way this is going to go and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's gonna come back and you </v>

1243
00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:13.581
<v Speaker 2>know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just took it.</v>

1244
00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I took it on the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pretty much fucking just kept showing </v>

1245
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.751
<v Speaker 2>up doing my thing because when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the pendulum swings into the good </v>

1246
00:49:20.751 --> 00:49:24.591
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going the same fucking direction </v>

1247
00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:24.591
<v Speaker 2>and the other area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1248
00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:24.591
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1249
00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:28.100
<v Speaker 3>there's a real backlash for somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 3>works hard to get attention.</v>

1250
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing about people when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you work hard to get attention,</v>

1251
00:49:32.271 --> 00:49:37.271
<v Speaker 3>if you get attention and people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people love Dave Chappelle and one of </v>

1252
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:37.271
<v Speaker 3>the things I love about Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1253
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 3>he's very reclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1254
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 3>he goes onstage like weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll show up in a park with a fucking </v>

1255
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:44.330
<v Speaker 3>PA system and do a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>

1256
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:46.940
<v Speaker 3>but when people promote a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1257
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:47.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1258
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:50.900
<v Speaker 3>get their name out there a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a backlash for that always.</v>

1259
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

1260
00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1261
00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.520
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that.</v>

1262
00:49:53.521 --> 00:49:58.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did that because in 1998 I was </v>

1263
00:49:58.521 --> 00:50:00.630
<v Speaker 2>sitting around doing nothing for most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day except waiting for sets.</v>

1264
00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:05.631
<v Speaker 2>I just come out here and I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>a documentary on fucking punk bands and </v>

1265
00:50:05.631 --> 00:50:06.870
<v Speaker 2>they were showing them put up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1266
00:50:06.871 --> 00:50:09.150
<v Speaker 2>we're dragon face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like literally,</v>

1267
00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:12.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nailing their flyers to telephone poles.</v>

1268
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And I remember sitting there going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I need to do.</v>

1269
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the modern version of that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to fucking build a fan base.</v>

1270
00:50:20.281 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I need to like some kind of grassroots </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because I'm going,</v>

1271
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this to pass me by and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what do I have?</v>

1272
00:50:26.341 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at nothing</v>

1273
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:33.190
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really shitty at a lot of things in </v>

1274
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 3>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really bad.</v>

1275
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the only way you ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it as a comic.</v>

1276
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 3>If I had other career paths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my other career path was brain damage.</v>

1277
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:40.730
<v Speaker 3>My other career path was kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1278
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.760
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get brain damage for no </v>

<v Speaker 3>with the Internet.</v>

<v Speaker 4>if I wasn't playing video games right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking bored man.</v>

1358
00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.590
<v Speaker 4>I was bored and I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I treat honestly.</v>

1359
00:54:09.591 --> 00:54:10.120
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

1360
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:12.350
<v Speaker 4>this is politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to shake hands.</v>

<v Speaker 4>this fucking shitty apartment with A.</v>

1363
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.840
<v Speaker 4>I think like Don Harris lived downstairs</v>
<v Speaker 4>would just be fucking screaming at </v>

1364
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 4>people don't know.</v>

1365
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:31.390
<v Speaker 1>He hosts a thing called the Ding Dong </v>
<v Speaker 1>show at the comedy store and it's all </v>

1366
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:32.530
<v Speaker 1>the most psychotic open milkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1367
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 1>there's certain open microbes that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like completely delusional and </v>

1368
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.661
<v Speaker 1>absolutely insane and their acts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just so bizarre that you can't believe </v>

1369
00:54:40.661 --> 00:54:44.531
<v Speaker 1>that real well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Baer is puts on a show specifically </v>

1370
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:44.531
<v Speaker 1>with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking genius,</v>

1371
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:45.590
<v Speaker 1>but he's always surrounded by nothing.</v>

1372
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.720
<v Speaker 4>And you were Polanski and windy city </v>
<v Speaker 4>heat.</v>

<v Speaker 4>favorite things I've done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I still have not seen it.</v>

1378
00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It's great for people who don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they.</v>

1379
00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:03.680

<v Speaker 1>little shout out?</v>

1496
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Like a story that we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the started doing this.</v>

1497
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:39.180
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it on the air.</v>

1498
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Them to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting though I,</v>

1499
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there right now going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1500
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:49.901
<v Speaker 1>He sent me my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite was the wireless ceo mail </v>

1501
00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:49.901
<v Speaker 1>that we got after that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

1502
00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1503
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry Mexicans.</v>

1504
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Terrible writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I saved a bunch of them.</v>

1505
00:59:56.301 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole folder called Carlos fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just the most ridiculous messages</v>

1506
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was shocking.</v>

1507
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Just shocking how dumb some people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

1508
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>What's weird about the whole text </v>
<v Speaker 1>messaging and everything?</v>

1509
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not to say it is calls me all the </v>

1510
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.151
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never texted me and I won't even answer </v>

1511
01:00:16.151 --> 01:00:16.151
<v Speaker 1>the phone anymore because it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid questions.</v>

1512
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the phone calls to dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to the point where I do too.</v>

1513
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1514
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be making calls in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1515
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>When I'm hooking up to the Bluetooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have cool conversations.</v>

1516
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm driving for an hour or so </v>

1517
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can text though,</v>

1518
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1519
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Why would I want to do that when I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a conversation in the car?</v>

1520
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1521
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you would rather text and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

1522
01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1523
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1524
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>My problem is I have like a really weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative head where I thought I start </v>

1525
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>thinking about something and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls me during that I,</v>

1526
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I'm just connecting my phone </v>

1527
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1528
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I don't know.</v>

1529
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be in this motor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

1530
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>y'all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're not committed.</v>

1531
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I told you that right room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That program that I use,</v>

1532
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disconnect the phone,</v>

1533
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I shut off my cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell everybody,</v>

1534
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>leave me the fuck alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write and then that's it.</v>

1535
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I go back there and write with right </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1536
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:14.771
<v Speaker 1>All you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever used that for writing </v>

1537
01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:14.771
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this up.</v>

1538
01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And like my mom says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1539
01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>your mom talked to my mom for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1540
01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to shoot myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this up.</v>

1541
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>When you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it um,</v>

1542
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it makes it turned into the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all you see on your desk,</v>

1543
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you see is green tax and black screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1544
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't access your task bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but smart you can do anything.</v>

1545
01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you can do is you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit and you know,</v>

1546
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>that's hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that keeps you focused.</v>

1547
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Totally focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I shut my phone off,</v>

1548
01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I write and I ended up seeing shit pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1549
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just think maybe I should just beat </v>

1551
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.421
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you just go start checking out </v>

1552
01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:52.421
<v Speaker 1>porn sites and spanking went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I hear you're writing a book right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying.</v>

1554
01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.200
<v Speaker 1>That shit's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1555
01:01:57.201 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the hardest things I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever fucking taken on.</v>

1556
01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing one right now and I won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>let anybody help me.</v>

1557
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>People came were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hire this guy and no one</v>

1558
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>will ever know and Zach and so and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to them and I'm like,</v>

1559
01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pathetic.</v>

1560
01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

1561
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I want this to be the hardest thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ever accomplished.</v>

1562
01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure that everyone knows </v>

1563
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>that every word is in a certain order</v>

1564
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 3>because I wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

1565
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 3>It's all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1566
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It's the best representation that I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with my thoughts.</v>

1567
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:28.740
<v Speaker 3>But you're a great writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've read some of your stuff.</v>

1568
01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't need any help in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that department.</v>

1569
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 3>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think everybody does.</v>

1570
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:34.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you use a,</v>

1571
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could use someone else's.</v>

1572
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:38.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1573
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 3>someone else who sees what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and has a different opinion on things.</v>

1574
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that's very beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've given my stuff,</v>

1575
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:50.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to friends or people that I trust to </v>

1576
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.630
<v Speaker 3>read it after the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so in that sense they help.</v>

1577
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get feedback.</v>

1578
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:56.571
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm definitely a better writer </v>
<v Speaker 3>now because of all the feedback that </v>

1579
01:02:56.571 --> 01:02:56.571
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten from people through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1580
01:02:56.571 --> 01:02:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the same.</v>

1581
01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like comedy in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>

1582
01:02:59.761 --> 01:03:04.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like your connection with the </v>

1583
01:03:04.761 --> 01:03:04.761
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's um,</v>

1584
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 3>it's such a hard thing to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes the words come to you when</v>

1585
01:03:08.761 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1586
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 3>when you're onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're performing and you know,</v>

1587
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

1588
01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.540
<v Speaker 3>you'll get in the groove and you'll bits</v>
<v Speaker 3>will come to you at a,</v>

1589
01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:17.010
<v Speaker 3>out of thin air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's something even crazier about</v>

1590
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:18.750
<v Speaker 3>it when you're writing because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're writing,</v>

1591
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll get through a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>paragraph and then I'll go back and read</v>

1592
01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:21.650
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1593
01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck did that even come to?</v>

1594
01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it just came out of space.</v>

1595
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:31.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm in this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>semi-conscious state when I'm running </v>

1596
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:33.630
<v Speaker 3>where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so zoned into what you're doing.</v>

1597
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 3>And as you're zoned in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sentence is just sort of form </v>

1598
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 3>themselves in your head and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed their position and no,</v>

1599
01:03:40.561 --> 01:03:41.700
<v Speaker 3>this isn't in the beginning.</v>

1600
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.870
<v Speaker 3>And then you read it again and it offers</v>
<v Speaker 3>you another perspective.</v>

1601
01:03:44.871 --> 01:03:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just all starts.</v>

1602
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:49.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like literally like you're tuning </v>
<v Speaker 3>into something that comes out of,</v>

1603
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 3>it's in the air somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It truly is like the most incredible </v>

1604
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 3>form of therapy that I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1605
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:55.450
<v Speaker 3>after my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1606
01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 3>my folks passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were like,</v>

1607
01:03:57.871 --> 01:04:02.871
<v Speaker 3>you should go talk to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I was bringing her onstage but </v>

1608
01:04:02.871 --> 01:04:05.901
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started writing and then </v>

1609
01:04:05.901 --> 01:04:06.150
<v Speaker 3>reading some of the shit that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing and realizing I didn't even know</v>

1610
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:09.300
<v Speaker 3>I felt that because you just get in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking zen place where you're like,</v>

1611
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even looking at the keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just putting it out there.</v>

1612
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 3>And then you read back and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1613
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:19.431
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even realize that's how I </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected those two things together or </v>

1614
01:04:19.431 --> 01:04:19.431
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1615
01:04:19.431 --> 01:04:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I love writing.</v>

1616
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:23.640
<v Speaker 3>It's just writing a book is tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important for comics too.</v>

1617
01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys who don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write,</v>

1618
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 3>they just liked to perform onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with funny ideas,</v>

1619
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 3>which is a great way to do it that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

1620
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.430
<v Speaker 3>but you're not going to get the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1621
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you're going to get ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 3>come to you when you sit down and just </v>

1622
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 3>write and then you could take those </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas of stage and fuck around with them</v>

1623
01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 3>and tweak them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you just try to go onstage,</v>

1624
01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:44.170
<v Speaker 3>just come up with stuff onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same.</v>

1625
01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have like a little kernel of</v>

1627
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:47.280
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can,</v>

1628
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I can improv if I know what I want to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>up there with,</v>

1629
01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:51.480
<v Speaker 3>but I hate getting caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just leaning.</v>

1630
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:55.190
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're leaning up there </v>
<v Speaker 3>going like what else?</v>

1631
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.210
<v Speaker 3>You find it really hard when once you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1632
01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I find it very hard once I do a special </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I know I have to do new shit </v>

1633
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.811
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm really like piecing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and I'm always doing a million </v>

1634
01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:05.811
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is once as as you are too.</v>

1635
01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm always doing a million different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things so it's hard to fucking pci those</v>

1636
01:05:07.951 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 3>new shit and then you got to do a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and you're like,</v>

1637
01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 3>fuck these people probably already see </v>
<v Speaker 3>my special,</v>

1638
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:17.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just aired fucking shit new shit that I </v>

1639
01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:17.280
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got like 40 minutes new shit.</v>

1640
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Bring that back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 45,</v>

1641
01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:19.460
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1642
01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:24.770
<v Speaker 3>ticket things that I hate bringing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>back that I've done before just feels </v>

1643
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Rodan and feels like you're a shithead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're cheating,</v>

1644
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:28.170
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1645
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.680
<v Speaker 3>you're robbing them or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1646
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Unless they ask for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people scream for it and if I can </v>

1647
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.710
<v Speaker 3>remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>

1648
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 3>Like some of the yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Anna Nicole Smith,</v>

1649
01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:39.340
<v Speaker 3>like I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like seven minutes long and I don't</v>

1650
01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 3>even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1651
01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 3>I know some of the punchlines.</v>

1652
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:45.080
<v Speaker 4>This may sound super fucking cheesy or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like Bon Jovi would do,</v>

1653
01:05:45.081 --> 01:05:50.081
<v Speaker 4>but during my last tour I would bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody up out of the crowd and I'd be </v>

1654
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:50.081
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1655
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:54.371
<v Speaker 4>the fucking Koolaid bit because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't done it and I'm watching them </v>

1656
01:05:54.891 --> 01:05:58.220
<v Speaker 4>act out and they know the kick that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would do or the whatever,</v>

1657
01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:01.040
<v Speaker 4>physical brick and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

1658
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 4>That's actually pretty fucking cool.</v>

1659
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:05.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started out doing comedy.</v>

1660
01:06:05.541 --> 01:06:09.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why I did come in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place was reenacting qbd and spits</v>

1661
01:06:09.831 --> 01:06:12.350
<v Speaker 3>that I saw on TV to my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like 18,</v>

1662
01:06:12.351 --> 01:06:17.351
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember there was a girl that I </v>

1663
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:19.871
<v Speaker 3>was working with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working at the Boston Athletic </v>

1664
01:06:19.871 --> 01:06:19.871
<v Speaker 3>Club in South Boston and I was a fitness</v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer.</v>

1665
01:06:19.871 --> 01:06:24.520
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this girl that was working there had </v>

1666
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.430
<v Speaker 3>seen Sam kinison on Hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she comes up to me and she goes,</v>

1667
01:06:25.431 --> 01:06:27.650
<v Speaker 3>do you gotta see this comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so fucking funny.</v>

1668
01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.530
<v Speaker 3>He does this bit about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.</v>

1669
01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.720
<v Speaker 3>She gets down on her stomach in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parking lot,</v>

1670
01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:37.721
<v Speaker 3>doing Sam kinisons bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a bit about the people having sex </v>

1671
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:39.620
<v Speaker 3>with the gay guys having sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>corpse and he's.</v>

1672
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.160
<v Speaker 3>She's lying down in the parking lot at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the athletic club and she's like,</v>

1673
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.840
<v Speaker 3>so here these guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how he does it.</v>

1674
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:47.480
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are the line of slabs.</v>

1675
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1676
01:06:48.591 --> 01:06:49.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to habitat,</v>

1677
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.430
<v Speaker 6>be with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Said,</v>

1678
01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.300
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is this?</v>

1679
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.910
<v Speaker 6>I kept taking my life keeps fucking in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ass.</v>

1680
01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:57.780
<v Speaker 6>Even after your dad.</v>

1681
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:04.110
<v Speaker 3>She did that bit for me in the parking </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot and I was howling laughing and I </v>

1682
01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:06.430
<v Speaker 3>instantly became obsessed with standup </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy and with Sam Kennison.</v>

1683
01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1684
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I have to go watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the craziest thing I've ever </v>

1685
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:12.300
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took a long time to fuck.</v>

1686
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get a vhs copy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1687
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 3>And I finally got to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1688
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1689
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:21.260
<v Speaker 4>So that would you say would that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was obviously one of the moments </v>

1690
01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.830
<v Speaker 4>that like diff or defined your formative</v>
<v Speaker 4>years in standup comedy?</v>

1691
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was that and there was a,</v>

1692
01:07:24.811 --> 01:07:26.550
<v Speaker 3>when I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was about 13.</v>

1693
01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:29.630
<v Speaker 3>My parents took me to see live on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunset strip and uh,</v>

1694
01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1695
01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.740
<v Speaker 3>my parents were hippies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sister was like 12.</v>

1696
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:39.770
<v Speaker 3>She went to Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're in this theater and I </v>

1697
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:42.090
<v Speaker 3>remember laughing so fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe in it.</v>

1698
01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.130
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of funny about standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1699
01:07:44.131 --> 01:07:46.830
<v Speaker 3>because Richard Pryor was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most brilliant ever for sure,</v>

1700
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:50.130
<v Speaker 3>but honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you watch it today,</v>

1701
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.110
<v Speaker 3>some of it is very dated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1702
01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.240
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hit me the way it hit me back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

1703
01:07:54.241 --> 01:07:56.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's the case with music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the case with a lot of things.</v>

1704
01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Lenny Bruce was one of the greatest I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever one of the most important pioneers </v>

1705
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:04.851
<v Speaker 3>of comedy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to laugh at this stuff </v>

1706
01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:07.461
<v Speaker 3>now because the culture changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's perceptions change and comedy </v>

1707
01:08:07.461 --> 01:08:07.461
<v Speaker 3>changes and there's.</v>

1708
01:08:07.461 --> 01:08:12.320
<v Speaker 3>The comedy that you do today would </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably be too shocking for people who </v>

1709
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.810
<v Speaker 3>lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like comedy is defined by its </v>

1710
01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>certain era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you go back and live in the sunset</v>

1711
01:08:16.071 --> 01:08:21.071
<v Speaker 3>strip today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to hit me like it hit me </v>

1712
01:08:21.071 --> 01:08:21.071
<v Speaker 3>when I was 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 13.</v>

1713
01:08:21.071 --> 01:08:25.211
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe there was someone </v>

1714
01:08:25.211 --> 01:08:25.820
<v Speaker 3>that actually saying these there and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was saying it's so perfectly.</v>

1715
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing and I remember looking around </v>

1716
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:31.000
<v Speaker 3>at this theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this.</v>

1717
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.170
<v Speaker 3>We're moving forward and the chairs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocking back and forth,</v>

1718
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:38.410
<v Speaker 3>and I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anyone laugh like this </v>

1719
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:39.300
<v Speaker 3>in a movie and this guy's just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1720
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:44.350
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] stripes had been out at </v>

1721
01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:44.350
<v Speaker 3>least one of the greatest comedy movies </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

1722
01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:44.780
<v Speaker 3>I might get stopped this funny.</v>

1723
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

1724
01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 3>This guy's just talking and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the first big seed.</v>

1725
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 3>That was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just the seat of my fascination</v>

1726
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:56.540
<v Speaker 3>with standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but until I got people that told me that</v>

1727
01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 3>I could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not think I could do it.</v>

1728
01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:03.671
<v Speaker 3>I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching taekwondo and finding a </v>

1729
01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:03.671
<v Speaker 3>tournament's and these guys that I train</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1730
01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I would make them laugh in the locker </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and on the way the tournament's </v>

1731
01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:08.320
<v Speaker 3>because everybody was scared on the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tournaments.</v>

1732
01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.311
<v Speaker 3>We were all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get kicked and punched </v>

1733
01:09:12.311 --> 01:09:14.321
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking terrifying and a lot of </v>

1734
01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:16.151
<v Speaker 3>guys got knocked out and you get to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>your friends get knocked unconscious by </v>

1735
01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 3>getting kicked in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a lot of like gallows humor</v>

1736
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 3>on these trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1737
01:09:17.871 --> 01:09:22.871
<v Speaker 3>we were just trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would always be the guy that would </v>

1738
01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:23.110
<v Speaker 3>like do impressions of all the different</v>
<v Speaker 3>teammates having sex and all that stupid</v>

1739
01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:26.390
<v Speaker 3>shit and that's how I got to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to doing standup comedy,</v>

1740
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:27.830
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fuck it.</v>

1741
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:32.831
<v Speaker 3>Some stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be one of the fucking </v>

1742
01:09:32.831 --> 01:09:35.261
<v Speaker 3>weirdest jobs to ever enter in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>because no one could tell you how to do </v>

1743
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:35.261
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1744
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to tell other people what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really is.</v>

1745
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 2>We could talk all day.</v>

1746
01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:42.830
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're at your best,</v>

1747
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.050
<v Speaker 3>when you're locked on onstage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crushing,</v>

1748
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.150
<v Speaker 3>don't you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you feel,</v>

1749
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 3>because this is how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm just writing it.</v>

1750
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm a passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1751
01:09:52.701 --> 01:09:54.530
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm tuned into this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1752
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.620
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like as everything's coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and I'm hitting all the things,</v>

1753
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1754
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:01.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm on autopilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

1755
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm in some crazy groove where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to watch this and I'm getting to</v>

1756
01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:06.860
<v Speaker 3>experience the words coming out of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth as they happen.</v>

1757
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how the fuck it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>working so smoothly.</v>

1758
01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I really can't even take credit for it.</v>

1759
01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.560
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak anywhere nears flawlessly </v>

1760
01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:19.450
<v Speaker 2>is when I'm on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I tried to tell you a bit,</v>

1761
01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I will stammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will fucking not remember and I can </v>

1762
01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:25.540
<v Speaker 2>groove on stage sometimes like surfing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>

1763
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I'm staying up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wave for an hour.</v>

1764
01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Just like</v>

1765
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 3>just that intensity that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an intensity of communicating </v>

1766
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 3>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1767
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:39.750
<v Speaker 3>just like every cylinder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in your brain fires up and it</v>

1768
01:10:39.751 --> 01:10:40.050
<v Speaker 3>cranked.</v>

1769
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.160
<v Speaker 2>There's that Steve Martin Accordion born</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up where he goes,</v>

1770
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it in my fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I point out I can feel it in my foot the</v>

1771
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 2>way it just moves and plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see every part of my body.</v>

1772
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.870
<v Speaker 2>It feels like it's emitting fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>

1773
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hated being a standard.</v>

1774
01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hated his.</v>

1775
01:10:58.211 --> 01:11:03.211
<v Speaker 3>The adulation that came when it became </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately gigantically successful and </v>

1776
01:11:03.211 --> 01:11:05.860
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't get an honest response from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people anymore.</v>

1777
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.920
<v Speaker 3>They would start screaming and cheering </v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as they saw him and he would do </v>

1778
01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.951
<v Speaker 3>these gigantic arenas that he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>control and they were just totally out </v>

1779
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:13.951
<v Speaker 3>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1780
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Which happens to a lot of guys when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get big.</v>

1781
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1782
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:19.641
<v Speaker 3>Chappelle when he was touring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be really frustrated when he </v>

1783
01:11:19.641 --> 01:11:23.760
<v Speaker 3>went after the Rick James Sketch sketch </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out because people will be yelling </v>

1784
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 3>out everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Rick James Bitch.</v>

1785
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:29.690
<v Speaker 3>He'd be in the middle of setups on like </v>
<v Speaker 3>James Bitch and they couldn't kick out </v>

1786
01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:29.690
<v Speaker 3>enough people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

1787
01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:30.150
<v Speaker 3>it was too nutty.</v>

1788
01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:32.060
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to me honestly,</v>

1789
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:36.020
<v Speaker 4>when dice was at his peak when I first </v>
<v Speaker 4>was watching the HBO specials,</v>

1790
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:41.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was young comedian specials and then </v>

1791
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:41.500
<v Speaker 4>he had that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember feeling like,</v>

1792
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.440
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck can I do this but not be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>character?</v>

1793
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.920
<v Speaker 4>How can I do this and be as real still </v>
<v Speaker 4>be an entertainer,</v>

1794
01:11:48.921 --> 01:11:53.921
<v Speaker 4>still be on but be as much me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's none of that fucking </v>

1795
01:11:53.921 --> 01:11:55.970
<v Speaker 4>catchphrase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got to see people,</v>

1801
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.440

<v Speaker 3>it's also like when you are first </v>

1802
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.001
<v Speaker 3>starting out to accommodate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old were you when you first got </v>

1809
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure when I'm 60 I'll look back at </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself now and go with the fucking shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1813
01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I did not have anything to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no reason for me to be there </v>

1814
01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:37.840
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what I was saying.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I could show you how to kick somebody in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the face.</v>

1817
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.030
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't have any opinions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were valid on anything else.</v>

1818
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1819
01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:50.420

<v Speaker 3>I could tell you something silly.</v>

01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:52.330
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend did want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was blown may or something.</v>

1824
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.100
<v Speaker 4>And I threw it off a little bit because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were saying like,</v>

1825
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 4>so then when chappelle started doing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger shows because yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he lost control of the fucking.</v>

1827
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Did you what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How quick was the jump between you doing</v>

<v Speaker 3>clubs and you're doing these giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>places?</v>

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Giant arenas.</v>

1830
01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:16.010
<v Speaker 4>It was actually a slow but steady </v>
<v Speaker 4>trajectory where when that web stuff,</v>

1831
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.520
<v Speaker 4>what happened was this in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my first real website that I put up in </v>

1858
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:33.700

<v Speaker 2>that was from 2000 2005.</v>

1859
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:39.060
<v Speaker 2>That's really what I did most of my day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it got to a point where you </v>

1860
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>don't need to read all the fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that comes back and you know,</v>

1862
01:14:46.531 --> 01:14:49.051
<v Speaker 2>negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it came down to I'm replying to </v>

01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I've been trawling as a kid for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't assume I agree with that.</v>

1867
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Twelve year old gets advice from him.</v>

1868
01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it took a while,</v>

1869
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not like everybody.</v>

1870
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:13.930
<v Speaker 2>There's that old expression or took 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to be an overnight sensation.</v>

1871
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a long time man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not.</v>

1872
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.510
<v Speaker 2>It was not as instant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe as some people thought it's got to</v>

1873
01:15:19.511 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 2>be satisfying</v>

1874
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:25.210
<v Speaker 3>though to know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went out here and you did some </v>

1875
01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:26.010
<v Speaker 3>movies and shit and some things didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>connect and didn't happen well for you,</v>

1876
01:15:26.011 --> 01:15:30.030
<v Speaker 3>but you did it all on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything was done through your,</v>

1877
01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.180
<v Speaker 3>your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figuring out how to self help,</v>

1878
01:15:33.181 --> 01:15:36.480
<v Speaker 3>self promote and you changed everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude about it.</v>

1879
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:41.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comics are good promoters except I mean </v>

1880
01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:41.610

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1882
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Comics were really good at self </v>
<v Speaker 3>promotion.</v>

1883
01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Totally changed my attitude towards</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're not really doing anything</v>

1949
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.840
<v Speaker 3>in order for you to develop the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fortitude that you're gonna need to get </v>

1950
01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 3>through the hard times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have something to prove.</v>

1951
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's too hard.</v>

1952
01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too hard to really push yourself.</v>

1953
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1954
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:24.910
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a chip on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder or something to prove or some </v>

1955
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:25.040
<v Speaker 3>gap to fill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna you're not gonna do it.</v>

1956
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Can I get through that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about all the guys that we started</v>

1957
01:18:27.381 --> 01:18:32.381
<v Speaker 3>out with that we're just as good as us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of guys that were very </v>

1958
01:18:32.381 --> 01:18:32.381
<v Speaker 3>commensurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were all really.</v>

1959
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Think of them happened to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

1960
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to have this one bit and used to</v>

1961
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:40.370
<v Speaker 3>destroy and they just could see that guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>on evening at the Improv.</v>

1962
01:18:40.371 --> 01:18:41.480
<v Speaker 3>I could see that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1963
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Ryan headlining and he just stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped down at girls too.</v>

1964
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 3>There was this chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leon Lewis.</v>

1965
01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:47.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1966
01:18:47.731 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I was an open mic or with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember her?</v>

1967
01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 3>She had some fucking good bits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1968
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.190
<v Speaker 3>She was still trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go on stage and had developed.</v>

1969
01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 3>But as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1970
01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:58.880
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a chick to especially,</v>

1971

1972
01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 3>well written shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1973
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chick's got huge someday.</v>

1974
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to be like,</v>

1975
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:09.200
<v Speaker 3>eleanor just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fell off.</v>

1976
01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Just where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1977
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many fucking so many slots.</v>

1978
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.920
<v Speaker 3>So many people going towards these slots</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of them just,</v>

1979
01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.130
<v Speaker 3>it's just too far up though the salmon </v>
<v Speaker 3>ladder that just fuck this.</v>

1980
01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Just can't do it.</v>

1981
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should use your Hollywood </v>

1982
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.441
<v Speaker 5>connections to get a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Hughes was just about to release </v>

1983
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:34.911
<v Speaker 5>the extra hour of planes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trains and automobiles that they filmed </v>

1984
01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:35.580
<v Speaker 5>right before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That what happened to that?</v>

1985
01:19:35.581 --> 01:19:36.910
<v Speaker 5>Now it's done.</v>

1986
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>It's probably all in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The family probably owns it and they </v>

1987
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>have to figure out the rights if that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he wanted.</v>

1988
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they'll probably release it </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

1989
01:19:42.781 --> 01:19:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Why would they want to keep it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1990
01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.150
<v Speaker 3>they've kept it for what,</v>

1991
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.570
<v Speaker 5>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1992
01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.070

<v Speaker 5>he wasn't going to release it ever,</v>

1993
01:19:48.071 --> 01:19:49.930
<v Speaker 5>but then just recently he was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1994
01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't know that unless it was in </v>

1995
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.941

<v Speaker 3>Who knows what the fuck's going to </v>

1996
01:19:58.941 --> 01:19:58.941
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

1997

<v Speaker 2>I was telling you before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1998
01:19:58.941 --> 01:19:59.440

<v Speaker 2>one Steve Martin moment.</v>

1999
01:19:59.441 --> 01:20:03.040
<v Speaker 2>That was really because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had dinner with them like a few months</v>

2000
01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.420
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent me a copy of his book.</v>

2001
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I was completely blown away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd never him.</v>

2002
01:20:07.351 --> 01:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I heard all this stuff about him that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Kinda like,</v>

2003
01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>

2004
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a little socially awkward,</v>

2005
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>all this shit and what a trip.</v>

2006
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 3>But as being someone that famous right</v>

2007
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:18.650
<v Speaker 2>meeting really your hero to which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do by the way,</v>

2008
01:20:18.651 --> 01:20:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you usually meet your heroes and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2009
01:20:20.031 --> 01:20:22.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was sucked.</v>

2010
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:23.930
<v Speaker 2>But with him I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2011
01:20:23.931 --> 01:20:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you sent me a copy of his book and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote back just to be like,</v>

2012
01:20:26.841 --> 01:20:29.300

<v Speaker 2>could I take you out to lunch?</v>

2013
01:20:29.301 --> 01:20:34.301
<v Speaker 2>And he agreed and so I sat down with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them for a little bit and he's really </v>

2014
01:20:34.301 --> 01:20:34.600
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

2015
01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I can be shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

2016
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can still be like a little bit </v>

2017
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:41.170
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's very much like,</v>

2018
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.830
<v Speaker 2>he won't say a word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think if you don't,</v>

2019
01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.510
<v Speaker 2>if you don't start the conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2020
01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he did say to me at one point,</v>

2021
01:20:46.461 --> 01:20:47.270
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2022
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:49.880
<v Speaker 2>he looked at me Kinda like perplexing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2023
01:20:49.881 --> 01:20:51.800
<v Speaker 2>you look like you really love it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2024
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.990
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

2026
01:20:53.691 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2027
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.020
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started kind of.</v>

2028
01:20:56.021 --> 01:20:56.510
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2029
01:20:56.511 --> 01:21:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

2030
01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even at the end.</v>

2031
01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:03.320
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never had that.</v>

2032
01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I never felt connected when I found out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that,</v>

2033
01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:11.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that so strange what I have least </v>

2034
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:11.280
<v Speaker 2>in common with Steve Martin's comedy.</v>

2035
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.670
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if his phrasing.</v>

2036
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:15.290
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's just got some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>connect in his mind.</v>

2037
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a naturally depressed person.</v>

2038
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read a lot,</v>

2039
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of this stuff in the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yorker when he would write.</v>

2040
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's depressing shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that he even knew who the fuck I was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fight kid rock and he wanted me to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a trainer.</v>

2136
01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:11.400
<v Speaker 1>He decided he needed to fight kid rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget Pamela Anderson's honor.</v>

2137
01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:13.920
<v Speaker 1>So he was talking to me about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a good trainer?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get you a trainer.</v>

2139
01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:17.500

<v Speaker 1>Tommy Lee and kid rock.</v>

2142
01:25:22.711 --> 01:25:25.490

<v Speaker 1>satisfying of all times though.</v>

2143
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Like at a musical,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Itunes,</v>

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.040
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a fake a.</v>

2182
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:39.890
<v Speaker 3>That was a stoner purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was $7 for four different sleeves.</v>

2183
01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I've got ahold shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lauren,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you got a whole shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like somebody sent it to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like I would wear it and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's flashy designer tights.</v>

2189
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:56.030
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're wearing a rash guard </v>

2190
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.030

<v Speaker 3>I don't know who you're.</v>

2195
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Steve Martin was where like a Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Center.</v>

2196
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:12.970
<v Speaker 3>One of those guys like Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rare is the closest I got to do shows </v>

2197
01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:14.120
<v Speaker 3>with dom at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was big to me because I paid to see</v>

2198

<v Speaker 3>don before ever did comedy and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who don't know dot Merera fuck in</v>

2199
01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Speaker 3>the late eighties and the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>

2200
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:22.400
<v Speaker 3>he was a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still very funny guy,</v>

2201
01:27:22.401 --> 01:27:25.400
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason he doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much attention as you know.</v>

2202
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I think his act deserves went back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2203
01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:28.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2204
01:27:28.491 --> 01:27:29.960
<v Speaker 3>really popular and I paid to see him.</v>

2205
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I was living in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took my girlfriend to see him at </v>

2206
01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Nick's comedy stop and I had never gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage yet and all of a sudden,</v>

2207
01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Montreal at the comedy festival,</v>

2208
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:40.190
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm working with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2209
01:27:40.191 --> 01:27:42.880
<v Speaker 3>And there's only like six years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years later,</v>

2210
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really fresh in my mind.</v>

2211
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck,</v>

2212
01:27:45.231 --> 01:27:50.231
<v Speaker 3>like I paid to see this guy and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>working with them like we're doing a </v>

2213
01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:50.231
<v Speaker 3>show together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2214
01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:54.551
<v Speaker 3>or were pulled on the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people are coming to see him </v>

2215
01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:54.551
<v Speaker 3>and they come see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2216
01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy,</v>

2217
01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.460
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not like,</v>

2218
01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:01.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became a friend and it became normal </v>

2219
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.590
<v Speaker 3>after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never got to see like my,</v>

2220
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I got to see a few of my real influences</v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

2221
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I saw Hicks live.</v>

2222
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I saw him live like four or five times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was that?</v>

2223
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:15.190
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him live and no one knew who he </v>

2224
01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:15.980
<v Speaker 3>was and here's an interesting thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy historians.</v>

2225
01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:18.560
<v Speaker 3>When Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first saw him,</v>

2226
01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:23.980
<v Speaker 3>he was very similar to Sam Kennison to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where it was like he was </v>

2227
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.390
<v Speaker 3>stealing his essence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say right now,</v>

2228
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:28.180
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the thing,</v>

2229
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of describing it.</v>

2230
01:28:30.971 --> 01:28:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first saw him,</v>

2231
01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:36.840
<v Speaker 3>he was making kinison like noises and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing like sounds like in between bits,</v>

2232
01:28:36.841 --> 01:28:38.400
<v Speaker 3>like the bit didn't go so well and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do those,</v>

2233
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.710
<v Speaker 3>this Kennison like thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2234
01:28:39.711 --> 01:28:44.711
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was like connected to kinisons </v>

2235
01:28:44.711 --> 01:28:47.231
<v Speaker 3>like thing and it makes sense because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like one of the guys that opened </v>

2236
01:28:47.231 --> 01:28:47.330
<v Speaker 3>with kinison and followed them around on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the road,</v>

2237
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.160
<v Speaker 3>but he got out of that quickly.</v>

2238
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:53.570
<v Speaker 3>We all are influenced by other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you had an Anthony Clark period.</v>

2239
01:28:53.571 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I had a Richard Jeni period where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped myself on stage and I realized I</v>

2240
01:28:57.651 --> 01:29:02.651
<v Speaker 3>sounded like my cadence and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>was Richard Jennings who was a big </v>

2241
01:29:02.651 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Richard Jeni fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

2242
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I gotta stop my salary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did a lot of people don't know </v>

2243
01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 3>that hix had that with Kennison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no evergreen,</v>

2244
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 3>but he thinks it's Hicks especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>because his dad have this,</v>

2245
01:29:11.761 --> 01:29:16.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this God who is an amazing comedian and </v>

2246
01:29:16.761 --> 01:29:16.761
<v Speaker 3>very influential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unique and,</v>

2247
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but all of us have this weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we want to be like someone we </v>

2248
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:23.790
<v Speaker 3>admire and sometimes it sounds like it </v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage,</v>

2249
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:29.420
<v Speaker 3>but he stopped that after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him once and he had it like that </v>

2250
01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.230
<v Speaker 3>and then I saw him again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2251
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.000
<v Speaker 3>just like six months later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't do any of that.</v>

2252
01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.070
<v Speaker 3>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a bunch of new shit.</v>

2253
01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I saw him do it headliners set at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy connection and then a headliner </v>

2254
01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:43.850
<v Speaker 3>set literally like six months later and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a totally new hour and almost </v>

2255
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.850
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

2256
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.880
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he figured it out.</v>

2257
01:29:43.881 --> 01:29:48.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that moment we all have where </v>

2258
01:29:48.881 --> 01:29:48.881
<v Speaker 2>it's like you just something clicks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you finally realize,</v>

2259
01:29:48.881 --> 01:29:49.700
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I need to do,</v>

2260
01:29:49.701 --> 01:29:52.310
<v Speaker 2>or this is my voice or my truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck.</v>

2261
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:55.740
<v Speaker 3>When you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a guy who's only human,</v>

2262
01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I believe when he died he was only 32 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

2263
01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:03.160
<v Speaker 3>His ideas and philosophies and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>validity of his opinions were so </v>

2264
01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.150
<v Speaker 3>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2265
01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:09.190
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a person of that age because really </v>

2266
01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:11.471
<v Speaker 3>like most 25 year old guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 25 when he's doing a lot of his </v>

2267
01:30:11.471 --> 01:30:11.471
<v Speaker 3>act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2268
01:30:11.471 --> 01:30:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Most 25 year old guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You better shut the fuck up if you want </v>

2269
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:16.280
<v Speaker 3>to tell me how the world's running to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop just you don't know and don't.</v>

2270
01:30:16.281 --> 01:30:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Don't give me any nobody fucking nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11 conspiracy website bullshit and</v>

2271
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you?</v>

2272
01:30:21.501 --> 01:30:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really just don't,</v>

2273
01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.030
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tell me how to run the world.</v>

2274
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's grow a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get some life experience.</v>

2275
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Then give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it to me from the perspective of </v>

2276
01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.330
<v Speaker 3>someone who's actually seen something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was advanced to like 25,</v>

2277
01:30:35.331 --> 01:30:40.331
<v Speaker 3>26,</v>
<v Speaker 3>27 really relevant points and really </v>

2278
01:30:40.331 --> 01:30:40.970
<v Speaker 3>good material there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No bad period.</v>

2279
01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:43.090
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at as material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2280
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:45.350
<v Speaker 3>like there was no period where it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2281
01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.880
<v Speaker 3>It got better and better and better.</v>

2282
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I think one thing that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really latched onto and maybe it was </v>

2283
01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.670
<v Speaker 2>after going through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemists and influence was like,</v>

2284
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:58.910
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate it was like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>release of whatever emotion it seemed </v>

2285
01:30:59.431 --> 01:31:04.431
<v Speaker 2>was going through him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just allowed it to come out even if </v>

2286
01:31:04.431 --> 01:31:06.630
<v Speaker 2>it was mid other story or idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would just watch that.</v>

2287
01:31:06.631 --> 01:31:08.880
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking that was empowering.</v>

2288
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2289
01:31:10.051 --> 01:31:13.260
<v Speaker 2>this is a place where you can go up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fucking ring shit out.</v>

2290
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:14.540
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2291
01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.200
<v Speaker 2>with a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like a good song.</v>

2292
01:31:16.201 --> 01:31:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't know the lyrics to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>song,</v>

2293
01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you just love the fucking song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize years later,</v>

2294
01:31:20.311 --> 01:31:25.311
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what they're saying </v>

2295
01:31:25.311 --> 01:31:26.361
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter and I think with </v>

2296
01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:28.680
<v Speaker 2>some comedians it's like it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much about what they're saying is how</v>

2297
01:31:28.681 --> 01:31:31.830
<v Speaker 2>they're expressing something emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind that.</v>

2298
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Those are the guys that I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched.</v>

2299
01:31:33.131 --> 01:31:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin,</v>

2300
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:37.740
<v Speaker 2>of course prior it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was truth mixed with just humor,</v>

2301
01:31:37.741 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Speaker 2>just random ideas.</v>

2302
01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I got to see two,</v>

2303
01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:45.951
<v Speaker 3>I got to see kinison become not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything kinison who was my.</v>

2304
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.200
<v Speaker 3>The guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember I told you that chick,</v>

2305
01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:50.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that thing in the parking lot.</v>

2306
01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:52.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what got me into comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally that's.</v>

2307
01:31:52.661 --> 01:31:54.600
<v Speaker 3>That was the bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Planted it.</v>

2308
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I got to see him perform live after he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had gotten really famous and really </v>

2309
01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.651
<v Speaker 3>successful and he would come on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the two girls and the whole thing </v>

2310
01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:03.651
<v Speaker 3>and it was like I didn't laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:04.810
<v Speaker 3>He stopped being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became like,</v>

2312
01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 3>this caricature of this guy you listen </v>
<v Speaker 3>to louder than hell.</v>

2313
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:13.440
<v Speaker 3>His first CD or whatever it was who </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to that still today and it's </v>

2314
01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:13.450
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

2315
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:15.940
<v Speaker 3>But if you go and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2316
01:32:15.941 --> 01:32:18.490
<v Speaker 3>you look at the stuff that he did like </v>
<v Speaker 3>right before he died,</v>

2317
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:19.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not good at all.</v>

2318
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he got caught up in that MTV wild </v>

2319
01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:24.630
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2320
01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:28.230
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the trench coat became an </v>

2321
01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:28.230
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like almost like a costume.</v>

2322
01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2323
01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Well dice for awhile kind of had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing going on too where he became </v>

2324
01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:33.680
<v Speaker 3>the dice man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2325
01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.080
<v Speaker 3>the dice man was a character that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to do on stage.</v>

2326
01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you should do these John Travolta </v>

2327
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:41.120
<v Speaker 3>impression.</v>

2328
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm young comedians.</v>

2329
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.130
<v Speaker 4>That's what I really liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thought he was really strong.</v>

2330
01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:44.760
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking brilliant and likable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charismatic.</v>

2331
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when dice burst onto the scene,</v>

2332
01:32:47.011 --> 01:32:52.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think I was right out of high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and I remember thinking that was </v>

2333
01:32:52.011 --> 01:32:52.800
<v Speaker 3>the funniest shit I've ever heard in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2334
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:57.990
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then hanging out with that guy at </v>

2335
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:57.990
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store years and years later </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just like,</v>

2336
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.620
<v Speaker 3>he's like a normal guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2337
01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:03.000
<v Speaker 3>but now he is the iceman full time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a character and now he's got this</v>

2338
01:33:03.001 --> 01:33:05.190
<v Speaker 3>leather jacket on and the gloves on full</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2339
01:33:05.191 --> 01:33:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

2340
01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I have a theory that it's like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2341
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:09.340
<v Speaker 4>when you're a character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just a character,</v>

2342
01:33:09.341 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 4>but like look at any sitcoms or any </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking throat history.</v>

2343
01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 4>If you play a character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with a weird name,</v>

2344
01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:18.340
<v Speaker 4>like if you're looking to poughkeepsie </v>
<v Speaker 4>or lundy,</v>

2345
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:20.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like you,</v>

2346
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 4>but then you become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2347
01:33:21.701 --> 01:33:26.701
<v Speaker 4>I need to keep that hairdo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to be recognized that era and you</v>

2348
01:33:26.771 --> 01:33:28.520
<v Speaker 4>play into it and I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2349
01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:33.650
<v Speaker 4>that's frustrating when you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's why I never wanted to be a </v>

2350
01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:33.650
<v Speaker 4>character man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2351
01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:36.940
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather change and not be as funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still have certain fans and I've had</v>

2352
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:41.941
<v Speaker 4>this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had fans go through to like your </v>

2353
01:33:41.941 --> 01:33:41.941
<v Speaker 4>stuff back when I first I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was a kid.</v>

2354
01:33:41.941 --> 01:33:42.790
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit I didn't.</v>

2355
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I was still new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if I didn't change,</v>

2356
01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:48.190
<v Speaker 4>you would not fucking hang out and care </v>
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

2357
01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.630
<v Speaker 4>What I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2358
01:33:49.631 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are going to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you at one stage.</v>

2359
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:53.890

<v Speaker 4>okay because that's where they are.</v>

2360
01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:56.200
<v Speaker 4>They are where you were at that stage of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your career.</v>

2361
01:33:56.201 --> 01:33:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2362

<v Speaker 4>I lost Ya.</v>

2364
01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 4>I got some new people on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost a few.</v>

2365
01:34:01.661 --> 01:34:04.810
<v Speaker 4>I got a few stragglers that that becomes</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you crave.</v>

2366
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I really believe because at first you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just want to get to keep my fans.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you let go of that and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody's going to check out for awhile</v>

2369
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:16.090
<v Speaker 4>and then I had a guy write me an email </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

2390
01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:56.260
<v Speaker 3>connection?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2391
01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 3>if you don't take that chance of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start about like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't even know what you're doing.</v>

2394

<v Speaker 3>It has to be what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's inside of you.</v>

2396
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.930

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2397
01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:12.230
<v Speaker 2>that's why when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new comics come to you out here and </v>

2398
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:12.230

<v Speaker 3>Because you're going to be like packaged</v>

2401
01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:19.830
<v Speaker 3>in immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a stigma on you leave.</v>

2402
01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Well there were so many guys at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh factory that became you,</v>

2403
01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you became famous.</v>

2404
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:29.370
<v Speaker 3>But when it was starting to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when you were like packing Dublin's</v>

2405
01:35:29.371 --> 01:35:30.570
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

2406
01:35:30.571 --> 01:35:33.840
<v Speaker 3>I noticed so many guys that were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you onstage.</v>

2407
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2408
01:35:34.501 --> 01:35:36.450
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2409
01:35:36.451 --> 01:35:41.451
<v Speaker 3>here's these guys that have noticed </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's working and they're </v>

2410
01:35:41.451 --> 01:35:41.970
<v Speaker 3>just jumping on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fascinating thing to see.</v>

2411
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:43.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a whole new wave.</v>

2412
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:48.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a wave of guys that came </v>

2413
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.931
<v Speaker 3>out of the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jo Koy that sounds just like you and </v>

01:35:50.931 --> 01:35:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Hedberg stand hopes there's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of clothes.</v>

2415
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2416

<v Speaker 3>Well a lot of Mitch Hedberg guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2417
01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys that all bad guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were like pretty good,</v>

2418
01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.250
<v Speaker 3>good comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they were like,</v>

2419
01:35:59.251 --> 01:36:00.840
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to stop doing that.</v>

2420
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're good.</v>

2421
01:36:02.101 --> 01:36:05.010
<v Speaker 3>You have some good jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but stop.</v>

2422
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2423
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:11.340
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like doing Mitch Hedberg.</v>

2424
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>

2425
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:15.270
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2426
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:16.420
<v Speaker 2>what had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

2427
01:36:16.421 --> 01:36:16.740
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2428
01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2429
01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm known.</v>

2430
01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:22.600
<v Speaker 2>People are talking about me when I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to fucking get something going.</v>

2431
01:36:22.601 --> 01:36:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And the is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really,</v>

2432
01:36:24.521 --> 01:36:27.760
<v Speaker 2>they were setting this tempo and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were guys that you see come out.</v>

2433
01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a little flattering and weird when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2434
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:31.210
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is kind of like me,</v>

2435
01:36:31.211 --> 01:36:33.490
<v Speaker 2>and it makes you not want to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy because you're,</v>

2436
01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.520
<v Speaker 2>you're a little freaked out by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you know that over a couple of </v>

2437
01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.150
<v Speaker 2>years down the line as guys start </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting frustrated,</v>

2438
01:36:40.151 --> 01:36:42.850
<v Speaker 2>those same guys were the ones who would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out of the woodwork and say,</v>

2439
01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:46.510
<v Speaker 2>oh no Dane fucking took from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing that shit.</v>

2440
01:36:46.690 --> 01:36:48.310
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will happen.</v>

2441
01:36:48.311 --> 01:36:50.740
<v Speaker 3>And guys will forget that they stole it </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>

2442
01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.470
<v Speaker 3>That does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll forget that they got the idea to</v>

2443
01:36:53.471 --> 01:36:56.590
<v Speaker 3>behave that way from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll decide in their head somehow</v>

2444
01:36:56.591 --> 01:36:58.750
<v Speaker 3>that they were doing at first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you guys would do that.</v>

2445
01:36:58.810 --> 01:36:59.650
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2446
01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>like you just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

2447
01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:01.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2448
01:37:01.981 --> 01:37:03.670
<v Speaker 2>you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a voice,</v>

2449
01:37:03.671 --> 01:37:08.671
<v Speaker 2>you have certain people that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>emulate and then you figure out your </v>

2450
01:37:08.671 --> 01:37:11.701
<v Speaker 2>shit and you grow out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm as kind of understanding and </v>

2451
01:37:11.701 --> 01:37:11.701
<v Speaker 2>cool about that because I've been up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2452
01:37:11.701 --> 01:37:12.070
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2453
01:37:12.071 --> 01:37:12.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

2454
01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:18.230
<v Speaker 3>but in the beginning though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel that way in the </v>

2455
01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:20.901
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like someone's stealing from </v>

2456
01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you and put a stop to it because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not famous and you're,</v>

2457
01:37:21.011 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 3>you're struggling and you're coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2458
01:37:23.331 --> 01:37:28.331
<v Speaker 3>and you just starting to do well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you see somebody start ganking off </v>

2459
01:37:28.331 --> 01:37:28.331
<v Speaker 3>you and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2460
01:37:28.331 --> 01:37:28.331
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2461
01:37:28.331 --> 01:37:32.570
<v Speaker 3>I created all this excess of the at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard work and you're just kind of like </v>

2462
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.570
<v Speaker 3>emulating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stopped doing that.</v>

2463
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing what you saw,</v>

2464
01:37:34.291 --> 01:37:36.840
<v Speaker 3>be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing a version of me.</v>

2465
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's tricky,</v>

2466
01:37:37.801 --> 01:37:38.880
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tricky thing.</v>

2467
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a tricky thing because it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like someone.</v>

2468
01:37:41.221 --> 01:37:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to let them do it.</v>

2469
01:37:42.931 --> 01:37:44.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2470
01:37:44.370 --> 01:37:46.710
<v Speaker 3>if you become successful just through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the merit of your own work,</v>

2471
01:37:46.711 --> 01:37:49.050
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be really clear who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>copying and who's,</v>

2472
01:37:49.051 --> 01:37:50.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's imitating who,</v>

2473
01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:52.710
<v Speaker 3>but it just doesn't feel like that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning,</v>

2474
01:37:52.711 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning when you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and you're not like,</v>

2475
01:37:54.931 --> 01:37:56.460
<v Speaker 3>if someone's doing me now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2476
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:57.780
<v Speaker 3>you have this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing that?</v>

2477
01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2478
01:37:58.201 --> 01:37:59.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2479
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:02.930
<v Speaker 3>and flatter even though it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2480
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.700
<v Speaker 3>but you figured they would be done with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2481
01:38:04.701 --> 01:38:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it when I was an open Miker,</v>

2482
01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it like it was a year in or </v>

2483
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:11.920
<v Speaker 3>two years in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2484
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I would hear myself sound like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

2485
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 3>but when someone's doing it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>their act on comedy central,</v>

2486
01:38:14.251 --> 01:38:15.000
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay man,</v>

2487
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 3>you took this too far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do your own thing.</v>

2488
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.800
<v Speaker 3>You have to have your own delivery.</v>

2489
01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

2490
01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:25.970
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because the first time in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life I ever ran into was with you when </v>

2491
01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:26.510
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2492
01:38:26.610 --> 01:38:31.610
<v Speaker 2>it was like 1998 and Joe called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was still living in that </v>

2493
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.610
<v Speaker 2>shitty apartment and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2494
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:32.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking bit that you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2495
01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:36.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like my closing bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was so fucked up by that.</v>

2496
01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Not only because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2497
01:38:38.611 --> 01:38:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of respect for Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

2498
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever want to be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that gets,</v>

2499
01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in that position.</v>

2500
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:50.210
<v Speaker 2>And I remember feeling like that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defining moment for me because it was </v>

2501
01:38:50.210 --> 01:38:54.141
<v Speaker 2>like I need to talk even more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not nostalgic things or things </v>

2502
01:38:54.141 --> 01:38:57.891
<v Speaker 2>that are outward that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things that are from me that </v>

2503
01:38:57.891 --> 01:38:57.891
<v Speaker 2>happened to me.</v>

2504
01:38:58.270 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 3>It's hard though because especially if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're influenced by someone else and </v>

2505
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.850
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bit is influenced by their bed.</v>

2506
01:39:03.851 --> 01:39:05.290
<v Speaker 3>And even though you know it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2507
01:39:05.291 --> 01:39:10.291
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't probably do it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone thinks that you kind of stole </v>

2508
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:10.900
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it kills and that's the problem,</v>

2509
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:14.530
<v Speaker 3>fucking crushed all you have at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's such a life pit.</v>

2510
01:39:14.531 --> 01:39:15.360
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2511
01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.370
<v Speaker 3>you could go up there with this one and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking slam it in.</v>

2512
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:23.790
<v Speaker 3>But really ethically it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to find out what's good about </v>

2513
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:25.060
<v Speaker 3>that and cut it out and try to add it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you create,</v>

2514
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2515
01:39:25.961 --> 01:39:28.360
<v Speaker 3>you can be influenced by something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2516
01:39:28.361 --> 01:39:30.790
<v Speaker 3>and you're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even aware of it,</v>

2517
01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:35.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never see what a lot of guys like </v>

2518
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.550
<v Speaker 3>work together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we saw that at the comedy store a </v>

2519

01:40:52.641 --> 01:40:56.061
<v Speaker 3>I write it down because I don't say it </v>

2552
01:40:56.061 --> 01:40:58.621
<v Speaker 3>front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that it's eventually </v>

<v Speaker 3>going to on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have to go away.</v>

2556
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:09.421
<v Speaker 3>have an idea and you start saying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea and they try to top it and they </v>

2557
01:41:09.421 --> 01:41:09.421

01:41:34.071 --> 01:41:34.860
<v Speaker 1>it to other people and then someone jams</v>
<v Speaker 1>in with their own shit,</v>

2569

<v Speaker 3>The odds are very,</v>

2660
01:44:59.881 --> 01:45:04.881
<v Speaker 3>very small that you're going to have </v>

2664
01:45:10.861 --> 01:45:15.030
<v Speaker 3>psychosis involved in the auditioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>process breaks people's souls because </v>

01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:19.980
<v Speaker 3>this getting this movie or getting this </v>
<v Speaker 3>television show or anything they're </v>

2666
01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.680
<v Speaker 3>auditioning for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be the biggest fucking moment </v>

2667
01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.961
<v Speaker 3>in their life and they're freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're pacing around the waiting </v>

2668
01:45:24.961 --> 01:45:25.020
<v Speaker 3>room and you get to see them go over </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lines like it's.</v>

2669
01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:26.040
<v Speaker 3>It makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went for.</v>

2670
01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:30.550
<v Speaker 3>I read for us at comic six months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got nervous being in the room with all</v>

2671
01:45:30.551 --> 01:45:32.350
<v Speaker 3>these people that were nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2672
01:45:32.351 --> 01:45:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a terrible feeling.</v>

2673
01:45:35.890 --> 01:45:37.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got money.</v>

2674
01:45:37.061 --> 01:45:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

2675
01:45:38.281 --> 01:45:43.281
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like it'd be a fun job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at all these people like </v>

2676
01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:46.530
<v Speaker 3>this is like a big fucking thing to big </v>
<v Speaker 3>break and doing that every day over and </v>

2677
01:45:46.530 --> 01:45:46.990
<v Speaker 3>over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting rejected,</v>

2678
01:45:46.991 --> 01:45:48.700
<v Speaker 3>getting rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needing that love,</v>

2679
01:45:48.701 --> 01:45:50.260
<v Speaker 3>getting rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needing that love,</v>

2680
01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.070
<v Speaker 3>getting rejected.</v>

2681
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.300
<v Speaker 3>So close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nope.</v>

2682
01:45:52.450 --> 01:45:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Final three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2683
01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2684
01:45:54.401 --> 01:45:57.630
<v Speaker 3>And they're doing this for years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and this is already a person who's</v>

2685
01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:00.010
<v Speaker 3>psychologically unbalanced already a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who.</v>

2686
01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:05.130
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>performer in the first place is they </v>

2687
01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:06.130
<v Speaker 3>want to be loved because they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>loved as a child.</v>

2688
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:09.750
<v Speaker 3>So there's this incredible horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>imbalance and they just can't,</v>

2689
01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.020
<v Speaker 3>can't quite connect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you start dating them and it's </v>

2690
01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:15.020
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

2691
01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.080
<v Speaker 3>you're not on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A comfortable road like this isn't going</v>

2692
01:46:17.081 --> 01:46:19.420
<v Speaker 3>to be smooth and relaxed and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>carefree.</v>

2693
01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.270
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be constant psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think I'm good?</v>

2694
01:46:22.271 --> 01:46:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you think I'm fat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this good?</v>

2695
01:46:23.651 --> 01:46:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Is What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I a loser?</v>

2696
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:28.840
<v Speaker 3>We read lines with me falling like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2697
01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.810
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not dating our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2698
01:46:31.811 --> 01:46:36.811
<v Speaker 3>but they should still have that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of fucking doing that five times a </v>

2699
01:46:36.811 --> 01:46:37.420
<v Speaker 3>day every day.</v>

2700
01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.780
<v Speaker 3>But they have success as comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference.</v>

2701
01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:43.570
<v Speaker 3>Guys like Joey and red either going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>auditions all the time,</v>

2702
01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:46.360
<v Speaker 3>but they're also killing it on stage all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

2703
01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.260
<v Speaker 3>They're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing comedy all the time,</v>

2704
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Joe,</v>

2705
01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:51.780
<v Speaker 3>he's always getting acting gigs here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2706
01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:54.000
<v Speaker 3>So it's like that in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always getting,</v>

2707
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>car commercials here and there,</v>

2708
01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:01.560
<v Speaker 3>doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the people that are not making the </v>

2709
01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:01.560
<v Speaker 3>connection and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls too,</v>

2710
01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a girl,</v>

2711
01:47:02.551 --> 01:47:07.551
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural feeling I think for a </v>

2712
01:47:07.551 --> 01:47:09.210
<v Speaker 3>girl to want some sort of male </v>
<v Speaker 3>companionship and protection for a woman</v>

2713
01:47:09.211 --> 01:47:11.250
<v Speaker 3>to be by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comes here from Omaha,</v>

2714
01:47:11.251 --> 01:47:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Nebraska or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to be incredibly insecure.</v>

2715
01:47:14.021 --> 01:47:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Look at Cork in the middle of the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>by herself.</v>

2716
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any friends committed to</v>

2717
01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:20.010
<v Speaker 3>this acting thing and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>rejection,</v>

2718
01:47:20.011 --> 01:47:21.180
<v Speaker 3>rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rejection,</v>

2719
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:26.450
<v Speaker 3>and then their whole childhood thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that dragged them there in the first </v>

2720
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.450
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you come along and your cage.</v>

2721
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Let's go see a movie like you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what the fuck you're getting into.</v>

2722
01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Just opening up to him</v>

2723
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:34.370
<v Speaker 2>door to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My ex was one of the classic cases of </v>

2724
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:36.000
<v Speaker 2>everything that I didn't know till after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the breakup.</v>

2725
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:41.001
<v Speaker 2>Everything she always said she hated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She came like literally every fucking </v>

2726
01:47:42.001 --> 01:47:42.620
<v Speaker 2>facet.</v>

2727
01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:44.140
<v Speaker 3>That's why they hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hate.</v>

2728
01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.810
<v Speaker 3>They hate taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're afraid of in themselves.</v>

2729
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2730
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 2>But it's tough because then people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

2736
01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:03.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be with a girl who's </v>

2737
01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:03.100
<v Speaker 2>in the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you kind of more trepidatious because </v>

2747
01:48:22.251 --> 01:48:22.251
<v Speaker 2>you're like art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's going to</v>

2748
01:48:22.251 --> 01:48:23.960
<v Speaker 3>throw that in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And trepidatious is a very rare word.</v>

2749
01:48:24.170 --> 01:48:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>

2750
01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.970
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong move.</v>

2751
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that do things </v>

2752
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:33.060
<v Speaker 3>that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't find someone in the business,</v>

2753
01:48:33.061 --> 01:48:35.220
<v Speaker 3>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just rare.</v>

2754
01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't rule it out.</v>

2755
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:38.910
<v Speaker 3>But as a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have an ethic,</v>

2756
01:48:38.911 --> 01:48:42.650
<v Speaker 3>it should be a no head shots policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find some normal chick I haven't had and</v>

2757
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:44.160
<v Speaker 3>buckshot policy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took care of my family and you know,</v>

2789
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I had money and then a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2790
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2791

<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff happened,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians or whether it was,</v>

2793

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my folks being sick or all the shit dog </v>

2794
01:50:12.871 --> 01:50:16.380
<v Speaker 2>shitting and getting evicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I didn't have time to just </v>

2795
01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:18.670
<v Speaker 2>be a regular person in process </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2796
01:50:18.970 --> 01:50:21.310
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what I've really done the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last couple years.</v>

2797
01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:26.420
<v Speaker 3>So go find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that it's drives me really crazy </v>

2798
01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:29.831
<v Speaker 3>when I come up with a bit and then I put</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on a special and then right after I </v>

2799
01:50:29.831 --> 01:50:30.290
<v Speaker 3>fucking film and I have a way better </v>
<v Speaker 3>tagline,</v>

01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.070
<v Speaker 3>then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll let this go too quick.</v>

2801
01:50:34.071 --> 01:50:37.390
<v Speaker 3>I should have worked on this part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>process of developing materials.</v>

2802
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:42.420
<v Speaker 3>You got to do a bit over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again until you find the rhythm of </v>

2803
01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:42.420
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find,</v>

2804
01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural order of the words and you </v>

2805
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never done.</v>

2806
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:46.850
<v Speaker 3>It's never done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2807
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:49.270
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the great things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys in Boston,</v>

2808
01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:54.380
<v Speaker 3>the untold story of why they were so </v>
<v Speaker 3>good as those guys had the same act </v>

2809
01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:58.031
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those guys unfortunately kept </v>

2810
01:50:58.031 --> 01:50:59.300
<v Speaker 3>the same act for years and years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and people actually grew to expect</v>

2811
01:50:59.301 --> 01:51:04.301
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would go see Steve Sweeney who was </v>

2812
01:51:04.301 --> 01:51:04.301
<v Speaker 3>fucking brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was the same.</v>

2813
01:51:04.301 --> 01:51:04.301
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2814
01:51:04.301 --> 01:51:05.930
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes that you had seen seven years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

2815
01:51:05.931 --> 01:51:10.931
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they and they had it down and they </v>

2816
01:51:10.931 --> 01:51:13.721
<v Speaker 3>had their act and it was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>machete and it would just slice through </v>

2817
01:51:13.721 --> 01:51:15.350
<v Speaker 3>the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just all the timing terminators.</v>

2818
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Timing was just perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2819
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 3>the timing was just deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was so many of those guys then </v>

2820
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2821
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2822
01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:26.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you come out with a bit and you don't</v>

2823
01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.510
<v Speaker 3>really develop it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you don't.</v>

2824
01:51:28.511 --> 01:51:31.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you didn't quite get it out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect way.</v>

2825
01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people love new shit.</v>

2826
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.030
<v Speaker 3>That's more important to them than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

2827
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:36.680
<v Speaker 3>but you want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2828
01:51:36.681 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you want to make sure it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to make sure it's really good.</v>

2829
01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I kinda was like a few years back it </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell into this routine of like,</v>

2830
01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:44.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's never done in.</v>

2831
01:51:44.881 --> 01:51:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's always kind of evolving in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else and that's okay.</v>

2832
01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more about who I am because I love guys </v>

2833
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:56.811
<v Speaker 2>like even Johnny Carson growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck jody was </v>

2834
01:51:56.811 --> 01:51:56.811
<v Speaker 2>talking about half the time when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

2835
01:51:56.811 --> 01:51:58.320
<v Speaker 2>but it was like this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're attracted to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person,</v>

<v Speaker 2>standup where you can't go anywhere else</v>

2838
01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:10.820
<v Speaker 2>except for maybe what we're doing here </v>
<v Speaker 2>today without somebody impeding on it </v>

2839
01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.150
<v Speaker 2>and like editing it or some standards </v>
<v Speaker 2>and practice.</v>

<v Speaker 2>except comedies.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Because you can say whatever it is you </v>

2842
01:52:20.031 --> 01:52:20.031
<v Speaker 2>want to say.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That why can't something be a little rag</v>

2860
01:52:57.041 --> 01:53:02.041
<v Speaker 4>tag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little messy in real and maybe a </v>

2861
01:53:02.041 --> 01:53:02.570
<v Speaker 4>little uncomfortable and really have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing moment.</v>

01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>

2863
01:53:03.111 --> 01:53:08.111
<v Speaker 3>I think this is very important because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think you're a very misunderstood guy </v>

2864
01:53:08.111 --> 01:53:09.620
<v Speaker 3>and the ability to express yourself for </v>
<v Speaker 3>long periods of time,</v>

2865
01:53:09.621 --> 01:53:13.070
<v Speaker 3>we'll get a chance for someone to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>your real personality as opposed to this</v>

2866
01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:15.830
<v Speaker 3>projected image that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

2867
01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:21.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is like an a great medium </v>

2868
01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.321
<v Speaker 3>because if you're doing like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight show set or something that </v>

2869
01:53:23.321 --> 01:53:23.321

<v Speaker 3>you're talking for seven minutes.</v>

2870
01:53:23.321 --> 01:53:24.230
<v Speaker 3>To me it always feels like it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2871
01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:25.100
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2872
01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know who has I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that I get it outright,</v>

2873

2876
01:53:34.581 --> 01:53:39.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fantastic opportunity that we </v>

2877
01:53:39.581 --> 01:53:42.221
<v Speaker 3>have today to do something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This didn't exist for a performance of </v>

2878
01:53:42.221 --> 01:53:42.221
<v Speaker 3>other generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the uh,</v>

2879
01:53:42.221 --> 01:53:44.690

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the jerk because as much as I could,</v>

3162
02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.340
<v Speaker 4>I was like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once he warmed up,</v>

3163
02:04:38.341 --> 02:04:39.930
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me a little about the jerk.</v>

3164
02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3165
02:04:40.621 --> 02:04:45.621
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just driving to the Gig everyday </v>

3166
02:04:45.621 --> 02:04:45.621
<v Speaker 4>with Carl Reiner and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this funny?</v>

3167
02:04:45.621 --> 02:04:49.490
<v Speaker 4>Is this funny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just doing more comics do and </v>

3168
02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:49.490
<v Speaker 4>then get to set and make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3169
02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3170
02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:52.020
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had no clue what we were doing or how</v>

3171
02:04:52.021 --> 02:04:57.021
<v Speaker 4>big that was going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what happened with them </v>

3172
02:04:57.021 --> 02:04:57.240
<v Speaker 4>because there was definitely a point in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his time kind of after planes,</v>

3173
02:04:57.241 --> 02:05:02.241
<v Speaker 4>trains and automobiles around Grand </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canyon Times or it seemed like he just </v>

3174
02:05:02.241 --> 02:05:05.631
<v Speaker 4>stopped playing Steve Martin and started</v>
<v Speaker 4>acting like a old man or something like </v>

3175
02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:10.400
<v Speaker 4>no more crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was forcing the crazy feeling that a </v>

3176
02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:11.130
<v Speaker 4>lot of comics who don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to take me serious.</v>

3177
02:05:11.131 --> 02:05:16.131
<v Speaker 4>A lot of comics go through that phase </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's like I'm a serious human </v>

3178
02:05:16.131 --> 02:05:18.210
<v Speaker 4>being stopped smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That weird thing.</v>

3179
02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Where were</v>

3180
02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:23.660
<v Speaker 3>comics want to be taken seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they start like making points on </v>

3181
02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 3>stage that aren't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3182
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:27.450
<v Speaker 3>I worked with this comic once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say his name,</v>

3183
02:05:27.451 --> 02:05:29.730
<v Speaker 3>but he's a political guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty famous guy,</v>

3184
02:05:30.090 --> 02:05:35.090
<v Speaker 3>and he did this line and then he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that usually gets an applause break and </v>

3185
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:39.270
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even remotely funny.</v>

3186
02:05:39.271 --> 02:05:44.271
<v Speaker 3>It was some silly fucking Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus Republican point that should be </v>

3187
02:05:44.271 --> 02:05:46.380
<v Speaker 3>obvious to anybody who's paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and it was just like,</v>

3188
02:05:46.381 --> 02:05:48.330
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're going for that.</v>

3189
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lose this perspective and all of a </v>

3190
02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:54.660
<v Speaker 3>sudden they start thinking that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this voice over</v>

3191
02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:58.410
<v Speaker 4>and people need to hear like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on</v>

3192
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:59.990
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to just be funny.</v>

3193
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have anything funny to say </v>

3194
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.360
<v Speaker 3>about a subject or if it's not setting </v>
<v Speaker 3>up something funny later.</v>

3195
02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:06.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

3196
02:06:06.471 --> 02:06:11.471
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get a point across or </v>
<v Speaker 3>give a perspective that may not be </v>

3197
02:06:11.471 --> 02:06:12.530
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gives us your point of view.</v>

3198
02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:17.531
<v Speaker 3>So I understand what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about when you say some funny shit </v>

3199
02:06:17.531 --> 02:06:17.531
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you start preaching,</v>

3200
02:06:17.531 --> 02:06:17.531
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking tricky</v>

3201
02:06:17.531 --> 02:06:17.770
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3202
02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3276
02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't have insight,</v>

3279
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:28.710

3280
02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:28.710
<v Speaker 2>can face that head on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm putting it together.</v>

3281
02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're talking about.</v>

3282
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:34.270
<v Speaker 3>And I heard that crazy story about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell happened on the </v>

3283
02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:36.090
<v Speaker 3>airplane right where they had to land </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the pilot.</v>

3284
02:09:36.091 --> 02:09:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I thought that he was a hazard to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flight.</v>

3285
02:09:37.911 --> 02:09:39.520
<v Speaker 3>So they landed early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3286
02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:42.560
<v Speaker 3>that's extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's extreme stuff.</v>

3287
02:09:42.561 --> 02:09:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck is going on,</v>

3288
02:09:44.181 --> 02:09:45.800
<v Speaker 3>but I met him.</v>

02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:50.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean the comedy clubs in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this show twice and he's just </v>

3290
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:52.670
<v Speaker 3>always been a cool dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never got to know him deep.</v>

3291
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's like that though.</v>

3292
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think a lot of people know him </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

3293
02:09:56.721 --> 02:09:57.470
<v Speaker 2>He's Kinda,</v>

02:10:08.521 --> 02:10:08.521

3300
02:10:08.521 --> 02:10:13.081
<v Speaker 3>reclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is kind of like the reluctant star </v>

3301

<v Speaker 4>more of people that like you more don't </v>

3317
02:10:50.471 --> 02:10:51.410
<v Speaker 4>like you will be attracted to you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you.</v>

3318
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

3319
02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:58.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hated a serious man and I went on </v>

3320
02:10:58.360 --> 02:10:58.360
<v Speaker 3>twitter and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously fucking suck.</v>

3321
02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody could have seen me perform </v>

3322
02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:03.360
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did the same thing,</v>

3323
02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:04.510
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to realize that,</v>

3324
02:11:04.511 --> 02:11:05.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to people,</v>

3325
02:11:05.710 --> 02:11:08.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of music that I fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>love and you know,</v>

3326
02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:11.020
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Rogan gets in the car with me.</v>

3327
02:11:11.021 --> 02:11:12.430
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you listening?</v>

3328
02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:13.690
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3329
02:11:13.691 --> 02:11:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I was made for loving you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3330
02:11:16.150 --> 02:11:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know this fucking song.</v>

3331
02:11:19.070 --> 02:11:21.030
<v Speaker 4>You know somebody likes your pelvis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3332
02:11:21.090 --> 02:11:23.340
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what he's dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many.</v>

3333
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:26.490
<v Speaker 4>When Steve Martin did arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Martin was doing also,</v>

3334
02:11:26.491 --> 02:11:28.980
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people say like arenas today,</v>

3335
02:11:29.190 --> 02:11:30.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing maybe 20,000</v>

3336
02:11:30.331 --> 02:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dude was doing fucking 60,000</v>

3337
02:11:33.061 --> 02:11:38.061
<v Speaker 4>people in an arena where he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>partitioned with no screens,</v>

3338
02:11:38.370 --> 02:11:42.240
<v Speaker 4>nothing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike white suit dot on the other side of</v>

3339
02:11:42.241 --> 02:11:43.500
<v Speaker 4>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you understand.</v>

3340
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:47.070
<v Speaker 4>But with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I have the most amazing,</v>

3341
02:11:47.071 --> 02:11:49.230
<v Speaker 4>like the guy that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my road guy,</v>

3342
02:11:49.231 --> 02:11:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Al Dot Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did Zeplin,</v>

3343
02:11:50.761 --> 02:11:53.250
<v Speaker 4>he did Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got all the gadgets.</v>

3344
02:11:53.370 --> 02:11:58.370
<v Speaker 4>We put screens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We make you feel like you're in your </v>

3345
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:58.370
<v Speaker 4>living room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go in the middle,</v>

3346
02:11:58.370 --> 02:12:01.530
<v Speaker 4>not because I want to be a gladiator </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's four theaters at any point.</v>

3347
02:12:01.590 --> 02:12:03.720
<v Speaker 4>It's easier to be close to people from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle.</v>

3348
02:12:03.721 --> 02:12:05.940
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like a thing where it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3349
02:12:05.941 --> 02:12:06.870
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by being in the middle,</v>

3350
02:12:06.871 --> 02:12:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the rockstars.</v>

3351
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:13.300
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like I need to be as close to </v>

3352
02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:14.811
<v Speaker 4>people in these big shows as positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only done one theater in the round show </v>

3353
02:12:14.811 --> 02:12:14.811
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe to.</v>

3354
02:12:14.811 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Was it a in Cape Cod?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3355
02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it turned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that rally?</v>

3356
02:12:21.231 --> 02:12:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that one?</v>

3357
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:25.500
<v Speaker 4>A minute where it would like the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

3358
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Was that feeling when it turned?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was feminine.</v>

3359
02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:28.080
<v Speaker 4>It was phoenix.</v>

3360
02:12:28.450 --> 02:12:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did something and it always weirded me</v>

3361
02:12:30.401 --> 02:12:32.100
<v Speaker 3>out that people are behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3362
02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:37.380
<v Speaker 3>fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm performing and I'm not looking at </v>

3363
02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:37.380
<v Speaker 3>these people behind me</v>

3364
02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:37.380
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3365
02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:39.110
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get past that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was freaking me out,</v>

3366
02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.970
<v Speaker 4>but what's really is smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3367
02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.580
<v Speaker 3>More,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more dynamic.</v>

3368
02:12:42.581 --> 02:12:47.581
<v Speaker 3>It's a three dimensional approach as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to standing in this one plane </v>

3369
02:12:47.581 --> 02:12:48.670
<v Speaker 3>facing this one way every time.</v>

3370
02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

3371
02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:54.320
<v Speaker 4>when people are behind you too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I always keep a little light on </v>

3372
02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.931
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a constant flow of energy by </v>

3373
02:12:56.931 --> 02:12:59.991
<v Speaker 4>seeing other people and feel it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something unique about being in </v>

3374
02:12:59.991 --> 02:12:59.991
<v Speaker 4>the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're seeing people,</v>

3375
02:12:59.991 --> 02:13:01.890
<v Speaker 4>not just you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just seeing a stage,</v>

3376
02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:06.900
<v Speaker 4>a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're seeing people watching you and </v>

3377
02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:06.900
<v Speaker 4>that is an additive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3378
02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:06.900
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3379
02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:07.230
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3380
02:13:07.231 --> 02:13:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3381
02:13:08.251 --> 02:13:13.251
<v Speaker 4>we're on this together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're just talking about audit </v>

3382
02:13:13.251 --> 02:13:13.251
<v Speaker 4>energy level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to talk about that.</v>

3383
02:13:13.251 --> 02:13:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Like for me it's like what you put out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and it doesn't dissipate the way I</v>

3384
02:13:15.481 --> 02:13:17.400
<v Speaker 4>feel it does when you're just launching </v>
<v Speaker 4>an APP.</v>

3385
02:13:17.401 --> 02:13:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Them like your mental look at me when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel like they're part of it,</v>

3386
02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:25.620
<v Speaker 4>they're connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of comedy man.</v>

3387
02:13:25.621 --> 02:13:27.180
<v Speaker 4>It's a different show and the screens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3388
02:13:27.181 --> 02:13:29.790
<v Speaker 4>I got all four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so even when my back's to you,</v>

3389
02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 4>there's never a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if</v>

3390
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you're up top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking directly out at a,</v>

3391
02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:35.310
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a screen.</v>

3392
02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:38.070
<v Speaker 2>So we figured out how to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty fucking bad.</v>

3393
02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3394
02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:42.310
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do shows for that many people.</v>

3395
02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:44.560
<v Speaker 3>What is it like to do a show for 20?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the most</v>

3396
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:46.640
<v Speaker 2>come out and do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next time I do a Gig,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just feel like to come out,</v>

3405
02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:04.740

<v Speaker 3>in front of 48,000.</v>

3432
02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Imagine bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine hitting a job?</v>

3433
02:15:03.401 --> 02:15:08.401
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you did a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 3>choke and they didn't like it and they </v>

3434
02:15:08.401 --> 02:15:10.690
<v Speaker 3>turn on you 48,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you got to still do another 40</v>

3435
02:15:10.691 --> 02:15:11.020
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

3436
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:13.290
<v Speaker 2>You better make sure that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests me.</v>

3437
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I made sure my fans are showing up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

3438
02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not setting myself up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of still look back and remember the</v>

3439
02:15:20.161 --> 02:15:22.170
<v Speaker 2>first time you ever bombed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3440
02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of them I just wrote.</v>

3441
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:25.710
<v Speaker 2>It's called New York.</v>

3442
02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wrote a chapter in this book.</v>

3443
02:15:29.271 --> 02:15:31.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing all on the very first time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever bombed,</v>

3444
02:15:31.611 --> 02:15:34.120
<v Speaker 3>which is a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible disaster that I,</v>

3445
02:15:34.121 --> 02:15:39.121
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget cause it was the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time I ever bombed while I was getting </v>

3446
02:15:39.121 --> 02:15:39.121
<v Speaker 3>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

3447
02:15:39.121 --> 02:15:40.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Balmy at open mic nights.</v>

3448
02:15:40.671 --> 02:15:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3449
02:15:41.691 --> 02:15:46.691
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's like five people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna eat shit onstage and you're only </v>

3450
02:15:46.691 --> 02:15:46.691
<v Speaker 3>up there for five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you do a paid.</v>

3451
02:15:46.691 --> 02:15:48.140
<v Speaker 3>And I was middling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have been middling.</v>

3452
02:15:48.141 --> 02:15:53.141
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy went on before me fucking </v>

3453
02:15:53.141 --> 02:15:53.141
<v Speaker 3>crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3454
02:15:53.141 --> 02:15:57.220
<v Speaker 3>there was this chick that I had seen the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last time I was there and she was super </v>

3455
02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:00.521
<v Speaker 3>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked her and she was in the front </v>

3456
02:16:00.521 --> 02:16:02.261
<v Speaker 3>row and she brought her friends and her </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends look and they were going to sit </v>

3457
02:16:02.261 --> 02:16:02.870
<v Speaker 3>in the front row when I went on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was panicking.</v>

3458
02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be like right in front </v>

3459
02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:08.080
<v Speaker 3>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was only like a year and accommodate a</v>

3460
02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:11.021
<v Speaker 3>year and a half post and this guy went </v>
<v Speaker 3>up who was the MC was way better than </v>

3461
02:16:11.021 --> 02:16:11.021
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

3462
02:16:11.021 --> 02:16:12.350
<v Speaker 3>He was already better than me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3463
02:16:12.351 --> 02:16:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I conned this fucking book to making me </v>
<v Speaker 3>a middle.</v>

3464
02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a cocky dude.</v>

3465
02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be.</v>

3466
02:16:17.330 --> 02:16:18.050
<v Speaker 3>I can middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

3467
02:16:18.051 --> 02:16:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I can middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he lets me move on.</v>

3468
02:16:19.551 --> 02:16:23.840
<v Speaker 3>This guy goes on stage and does and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped doing comedy.</v>

3469
02:16:23.841 --> 02:16:25.280
<v Speaker 3>It's really too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a natural.</v>

3470
02:16:25.281 --> 02:16:30.281
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember his name unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he fucking killed and then I went </v>

3471
02:16:30.281 --> 02:16:34.230
<v Speaker 3>him an eight just drive bricks of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>with no water for 20 minutes.</v>

3472
02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:38.260
<v Speaker 3>It was the most embarrassing feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever had in my life.</v>

3473
02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:43.180
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe how unbearable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and her friends were like looking at</v>

3474
02:16:43.181 --> 02:16:45.250
<v Speaker 3>each other and her friends would lean </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and say something like,</v>

3475
02:16:46.330 --> 02:16:51.330
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I could hear crickets and I'm </v>

3476
02:16:51.330 --> 02:16:54.271
<v Speaker 3>trying to be like extra loud because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to like be trying to bring it </v>

3477
02:16:54.271 --> 02:16:58.411
<v Speaker 3>back to my side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you like forced the punchlines </v>

3478
02:16:58.411 --> 02:17:01.381
<v Speaker 3>and the timing is all even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my only experience with being </v>

3479
02:17:01.381 --> 02:17:06.031
<v Speaker 3>nervous before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my only experience with pressure had </v>

3480
02:17:06.031 --> 02:17:08.581
<v Speaker 3>been fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you know fighting and </v>

3481
02:17:08.581 --> 02:17:08.581
<v Speaker 3>tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3482
02:17:08.581 --> 02:17:09.020
<v Speaker 3>if you're nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just turned inward and you say,</v>

3483
02:17:09.021 --> 02:17:09.970
<v Speaker 3>this isn't mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do this,</v>

3484
02:17:09.971 --> 02:17:14.971
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do is I'm going to fucking </v>

3485
02:17:14.971 --> 02:17:14.971
<v Speaker 3>explode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to go terrified.</v>

3486
02:17:14.971 --> 02:17:19.531
<v Speaker 3>But you just get psyched up to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is the worst thing you could ever </v>

3487
02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:22.801
<v Speaker 3>do on stage to be nervous and aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking and all introspective and </v>

3488
02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:24.640
<v Speaker 3>turned into yourself and to get faculty </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take them are just going to call.</v>

3489
02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:27.640
<v Speaker 3>It was the worst mindset ever for </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

3490
02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:31.410
<v Speaker 2>That's called being Carlos Mitzia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn it in.</v>

3491
02:17:31.411 --> 02:17:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to explode</v>

3492
02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:36.400
<v Speaker 3>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a shoe.</v>

3493
02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever do shows about microphones?</v>

<v Speaker 2>cafeteria.</v>

3499
02:17:52.281 --> 02:17:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Standing on a cliff.</v>

02:19:55.190 --> 02:20:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Their mouths are slides in here and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do comedy for them and Scott </v>

3545
02:20:00.411 --> 02:20:03.470
<v Speaker 3>gets up and starts shitting all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and he was not really.</v>

3546
02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:06.290
<v Speaker 3>He hadn't been doing comedy that long </v>
<v Speaker 3>then really probably shouldn't have been</v>

3547
02:20:06.291 --> 02:20:08.240
<v Speaker 3>on stage in this sort of situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

3548
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 3>And I went on after him and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>already turned their backs to the comedy</v>

3549
02:20:11.841 --> 02:20:12.800
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a conversation and we had to stay in a </v>

3551
02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:20.090

<v Speaker 3>They have two cots in a supply room with</v>

3553
02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:26.850
<v Speaker 3>no shower and there was a bathroom,</v>

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 4>experiments like half fucking cougar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why there's not</v>

3600
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.220
<v Speaker 3>sword fights on TV is because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 3>put sword fights on TV.</v>

3601
02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:31.320
<v Speaker 3>If they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would love to watch that.</v>

3602
02:22:31.321 --> 02:22:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Two guys with Samurai swords trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hack each other's fucking head.</v>

3603
02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.400

3606
02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:44.120
<v Speaker 3>different than us today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3607
02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:45.450

<v Speaker 3>gaggers.com?</v>

3608
02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:47.700
<v Speaker 3>How is that different than some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that you watch?</v>

3609
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Like those Mexican drug dealers cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's head off with a small knife.</v>

3610
02:22:51.211 --> 02:22:56.211
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you see the suicide jump off off </v>

3611
02:22:56.211 --> 02:23:00.990
<v Speaker 3>the fucking Uber has had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It blows up like a coconut undergoes </v>

3612
02:23:02.370 --> 02:23:04.110
<v Speaker 3>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't unsee that stuff,</v>

3613
02:23:04.111 --> 02:23:09.111
<v Speaker 3>but you know that it's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you see someone really </v>

3614
02:23:09.111 --> 02:23:09.270
<v Speaker 3>fucking shifty when you go to seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11,</v>

3615
02:23:09.271 --> 02:23:11.210
<v Speaker 3>you should know this guy might pull out </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun,</v>

3616
02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:13.710
<v Speaker 3>might commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck knows.</v>

3617
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3618
02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:16.950
<v Speaker 3>you've seen so much fucked up shit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>

3619
02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I think to a certain extent it </v>
<v Speaker 3>influences people's behavior and it </v>

3620
02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:25.461
<v Speaker 3>makes people a little bit more fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>than maybe they could be because they </v>

3621
02:23:25.461 --> 02:23:25.461
<v Speaker 3>have all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have access to this,</v>

3622
02:23:25.461 --> 02:23:28.170
<v Speaker 3>but on the other side you should be more</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of what is possible.</v>

3623
02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 3>You might be a good person who is always</v>
<v Speaker 3>around nice people.</v>

3624
02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:35.601
<v Speaker 3>You're a mormon or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you think everybody's a mellow </v>

3625
02:23:35.601 --> 02:23:38.271
<v Speaker 3>and predictable and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're around some fucking gang banger </v>

3626
02:23:38.271 --> 02:23:38.520
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know what the fuck this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3627
02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:43.820
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's what game he's </v>

3628

<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>

3630
02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't realize in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>

3631
02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you have no true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better fight your fucking ass off </v>

3632
02:23:50.330 --> 02:23:50.880
<v Speaker 2>when you see people going along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're like,</v>

3633
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:52.080

<v Speaker 3>Piss on your unconscious body.</v>

3657
02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:50.220
<v Speaker 3>And on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3658
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:53.290
<v Speaker 3>at the end of this fucking podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3659
02:24:53.291 --> 02:24:58.291
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you came over to again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're sponsored by the fleshlight </v>

3660
02:24:58.291 --> 02:24:58.291
<v Speaker 3>fleshlight.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3661
02:24:58.291 --> 02:24:59.490
<v Speaker 3>you and I have had our differences over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the year,</v>

3662
02:24:59.491 --> 02:24:59.980
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3663
02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:01.200
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3664
02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:03.090
<v Speaker 3>respected your ability to market </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

3665
02:25:03.091 --> 02:25:08.091
<v Speaker 3>And I always respected your ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think sometimes when people are </v>

3666
02:25:08.091 --> 02:25:11.211
<v Speaker 3>ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things don't necessarily work out the </v>

3667
02:25:11.211 --> 02:25:11.880
<v Speaker 3>way they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know you're a good dude and I know</v>

3668
02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:12.920
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3669
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:15.300
<v Speaker 3>you're always working on your act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it all the time.</v>

3670
02:25:15.301 --> 02:25:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I know you're doing the right things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear your interviews and I know you're</v>

3671
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:21.000
<v Speaker 3>in a good place with your mind and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's important,</v>

3672
02:25:21.001 --> 02:25:21.900
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3673
02:25:21.901 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also important that,</v>

3674
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a certain stage in your life,</v>

3675
02:25:25.631 --> 02:25:30.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to recognize when you've had </v>

3676
02:25:30.631 --> 02:25:32.191
<v Speaker 3>differences with somebody and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that I don't like you as a </v>

3677
02:25:32.191 --> 02:25:32.191
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3678
02:25:32.191 --> 02:25:34.040
<v Speaker 3>just differences and I'm glad that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>put all that shit past and</v>

3679
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:39.590
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means the world here in that you </v>

3680
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:42.080
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of integrity and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always had a lot of respect for </v>

3681
02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.451
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason that there </v>

3682
02:25:44.451 --> 02:25:44.670
<v Speaker 2>was for me on my side when anybody ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>came to me with anything.</v>

3683
02:25:44.671 --> 02:25:48.390
<v Speaker 2>It was like I have really nothing to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and I hope that time will just,</v>

3684
02:25:48.391 --> 02:25:49.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually figure that out.</v>

3685
02:25:49.951 --> 02:25:52.770
<v Speaker 2>So I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to be here on your show.</v>

3686
02:25:52.771 --> 02:25:53.310
<v Speaker 2>We'll do it again.</v>

3687
02:25:53.410 --> 02:25:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3688
02:25:53.981 --> 02:25:54.850
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3689
02:25:54.851 --> 02:25:55.670
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3690
02:25:55.690 --> 02:25:56.860
<v Speaker 3>stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3691
02:25:56.861 --> 02:26:00.430
<v Speaker 3>is perfect for a guy like you to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people really get a chance to see who</v>

3692
02:26:00.431 --> 02:26:01.360
<v Speaker 3>you really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

3693
02:26:01.390 --> 02:26:02.250
<v Speaker 3>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3694
02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:06.790
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think anybody who was thrust</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your condition is going to come out</v>

3695
02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:08.500
<v Speaker 3>of it without some scrapes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

3696
02:26:08.501 --> 02:26:11.400
<v Speaker 3>you thrust yourself into like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

3697
02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stratosphere like that.</v>

3698
02:26:14.201 --> 02:26:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Very few human beings ever have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>navigate how many Lohan you did it.</v>

3699
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did it over a very short period of </v>

3700
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.190
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think people need to respect that.</v>

3701
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I think you did an awesome job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

3702
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I've got through it and you're doing all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right shit.</v>

3703
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:28.720

<v Speaker 3>incident.</v>
