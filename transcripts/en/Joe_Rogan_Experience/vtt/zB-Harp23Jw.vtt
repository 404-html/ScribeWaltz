1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience cause kevin pereira just signed up for it.</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Like that night at midnight,</v>

3
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:10.101
<v Speaker 1>he was on the computer signing up for Obamacare and I think he pays like $200 a</v>

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>month or $300 a month for like really fucking awesome insurance because of it</v>

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.871
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

7
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't start until January,</v>

8
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to sign up for nurses.</v>

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>This is the sign up period.</v>

10
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get everybody,</v>

11
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>but like there's all these ads on TV telling you that it's bad and that you</v>

12
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't sign up for it.</v>

13
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>They have ads that try to encourage young people to not sign up for it because</v>

14
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.674
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

15
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>a young woman is sitting in like a gynecologist office with her feet in the</v>

17
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>stirrups and then the gynecologist has a giant ugly,</v>

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Sam,</v>

20
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>a paper say Uncle Sam head that rises up and it's like looming over her vagina.</v>

21
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Like trying to tell young people,</v>

22
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>don't sign up for Obamacare because then they're gone.</v>

23
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Then the government's going to tell you what you can do with your vagina.</v>

24
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>What was the true,</v>

25
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>it was the government has a vagina agenda.</v>

26
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is is they argue that Republicans do are,</v>

27
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.953
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

28
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>do have a vagina agenda.</v>

30
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.773
<v Speaker 1>But it's not too,</v>

31
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird that they've,</v>

32
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they basically have just flipped the script.</v>

33
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Like it's supposed to be that,</v>

34
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.061
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans are anti woman,</v>

37
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to make it look like Obama's w really the one that wants to</v>

38
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>tell you when,</v>

39
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>what you could do with your vagina.</v>

40
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a manipulative,</v>

41
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>it's about healthcare period.</v>

42
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>So they use it to like sexual health care.</v>

43
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>They go to that right away.</v>

44
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.831
<v Speaker 1>Babies,</v>

45
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Vagina.</v>

46
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Your wife's poss.</v>

47
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Well cause that's what the Democrats had been using.</v>

49
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>They've been saying the Republicans are anti woman,</v>

50
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:35.551
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>

51
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>so they're just using the same approach but saying,</v>

52
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>but putting it on Obamacare and Obamacare has anti woman,</v>

53
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating that they're allowed to do that.</v>

54
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.811
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinated.</v>

55
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to editorialize at all and that they're allowed to have like any</v>

56
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>sort of dramatic influence at all and their commercials.</v>

57
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

58
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you're allowing people to manipulate.</v>

59
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Doug Benson has shown time and time again.</v>

61
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't care about the people of Los Angeles.</v>

62
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Doug Benson promotes smoking marijuana for underage children,</v>

63
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>including your chilled trend.</v>

64
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Doug Benson is not a good American.</v>

65
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

66
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>he would live in Canada if it wasn't so fucking cold.</v>

67
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Doug Pencil president,</v>

68
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but they almost can say that man,</v>

69
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>they can think they're so dramatic.</v>

70
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not facts like very clear,</v>

71
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:30.301
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>

72
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>vetted facts that have been verified on both sides and agreed to,</v>

73
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

74
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

75
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:34.061
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

76
00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:34.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

77
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense,</v>

78
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>hyperbole,</v>

79
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>

80
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>dramatic writing,</v>

81
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking manipulation,</v>

82
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:41.641
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>

83
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>all that standard fare and oh by the way,</v>

84
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>we've been paid for by giant corporations.</v>

85
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a language.</v>

86
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>They had an amazing spirit experiment in this book where Major League baseball</v>

87
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>players,</v>

88
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them are off the charts.</v>

89
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Visually,</v>

90
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 1>they have 2010 2017 vision.</v>

91
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no really great hitters there.</v>

92
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Don't think there are any</v>

93
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>who have even 2020 vision.</v>

94
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>They almost all without a doubt have vision that is off the charts there in the</v>

95
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>1.1% I'm talking about all major league hitters,</v>

96
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.381
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

98
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 2>and the book is very eloquent and about this.</v>

99
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.310
<v Speaker 2>And so they took Albert Poo hosts and who and Alex Rodriguez and some incredible</v>

100
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.363
<v Speaker 2>hitters,</v>

101
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>like the best of all time of their generation.</v>

102
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 2>And they had um,</v>

103
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things they found is that when a baseball comes at you at 95</v>

104
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour from 60 feet away,</v>

105
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to guess where it's going.</v>

106
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to see it.</v>

107
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 2>The human eye cannot register in time to actually see and hit the ball.</v>

108
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>So what great hitters do is they're able to actually see the seams on the ball.</v>

109
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They're able to see the seams on the ball.</v>

110
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>And so years and years of how those scenes are rolling and how that pitcher</v>

111
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 2>throws the ball,</v>

112
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>they're able,</v>

113
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 2>if they're very good,</v>

114
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>if they're very good,</v>

115
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 2>30% of the time they are able to predict and start swinging basically when he</v>

116
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>lets go of the ball.</v>

117
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 2>So that's where,</v>

118
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>why curve balls and shit work.</v>

119
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:58.751
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

120
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Because they can change where the ball's going to be changed direction.</v>

121
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>But also the way you hit a curve off you're really great is you've,</v>

122
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 2>you can see the way these guys can literally,</v>

123
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>cause they have such good eyes can see the pattern of the red strings coming at</v>

124
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>you at 95 miles an hour.</v>

125
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>They can chunk all that information quickly enough and start swinging low as</v>

126
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 2>opposed to hi and connect.</v>

127
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>So you have to guess.</v>

128
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Now they take the greatest hitters in major league baseball and they take how</v>

129
00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 2>female Olympic softball pitcher who pitches underhand.</v>

130
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Now the distance is about 40 feet,</v>

131
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more than 40 feet.</v>

132
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 2>The ball's coming over at about 60 miles an hour,</v>

133
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>not 95 miles an hour.</v>

134
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.790
<v Speaker 2>And she pitches underhand.</v>

135
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Now these are the best pitchers and they hit a much smaller ball at 95 miles an</v>

136
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

137
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 2>She struck out every single picture over and over and over again.</v>

138
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.481
<v Speaker 2>Because guess what?</v>

139
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.201
<v Speaker 2>There are novices,</v>

140
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>cause you know why they couldn't guess.</v>

141
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at a very different ball.</v>

142
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the strings and she was pitching underhand so they,</v>

143
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 2>there was no way for them to predict anything.</v>

144
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 2>They were swinging blind and they were as bad as you and I.</v>

145
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.043
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

146
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.630
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

147
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So the more you learn,</v>

148
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:05.561
<v Speaker 2>the more we learn.</v>

149
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Not only about you have to have a certain hardware.</v>

150
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>We know as an athlete you are never going to be,</v>

151
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you and I are never going to be sprinters.</v>

152
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.651
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

153
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.484
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

154
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.740
<v Speaker 1>The coverage from they learned from Ross Perot tell you what Ross Perot through</v>

155
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Daca and billion dollar monkey wrenching and they're fucking plans and folks who</v>

156
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 1>were young and full of life.</v>

157
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't remember Ross Perot.</v>

158
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Ross Perot cost towards Bush's second term.</v>

159
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Ross Perot was a bad motherfucker.</v>

161
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.993
<v Speaker 1>That's why Clinton won.</v>

162
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>He came around,</v>

163
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Ross Perot came around and all of the sudden there was this billionaire dude</v>

164
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 1>explaining how the government works,</v>

165
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 1>explaining the federal debt,</v>

166
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.510
<v Speaker 1>explaining the the f the Federal Bank explaining taxes and you're like,</v>

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

169
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:50.791
<v Speaker 1>He took time,</v>

170
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:51.441
<v Speaker 1>time on,</v>

171
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:52.980
<v Speaker 1>on network television.</v>

172
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so gangster about him.</v>

173
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was before the Internet.</v>

174
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>This was not going when everybody was online.</v>

175
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>This was like early nineties yeah.</v>

176
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.021
<v Speaker 1>You know what was there?</v>

177
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember here was it the Clinton election was 92 right?</v>

178
00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>92 yeah man.</v>

181
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I remember my friend John was like helping with his campaign ever helps them.</v>

182
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

183
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.211
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

184
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:10.491
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

185
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker's going to get rid of all the crooks who was so excited about</v>

186
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:13.960
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

187
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>People were excited about Ross Perot was like the original Ron Paul.</v>

189
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

190
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>But Ross Perot was way more gangster cause he had all that cash.</v>

191
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

192
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>the money.</v>

193
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And he had a way of talking and saying,</v>

194
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

195
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

196
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>The crazy old ball fuck from down in Texas can tell she that was,</v>

198
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.103
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

199
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that was a real interesting thing.</v>

200
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>So from there they changed the commission for presidential debates or whatever</v>

201
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>they call it,</v>

202
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>which is a privately funded institution.</v>

203
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>You know this corporations back it.</v>

204
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

205
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's a government program so they can decide who gets it.</v>

206
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:46.024
<v Speaker 1>Debate who doesn't.</v>

207
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a Ross.</v>

208
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is because we have</v>

209
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I process in Washington where after you have Sarah for a while,</v>

210
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

211
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 3>she hadn't become a foreign lobbyists make $30,000 a month.</v>

212
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.291
<v Speaker 3>Then take a leave,</v>

213
00:06:58.291 --> 00:06:59.940
<v Speaker 3>work on presidential campaigns,</v>

214
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 3>make sure you got good contacts and then go back out there.</v>

215
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 3>If you just want to get down to brass tacks,</v>

216
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.170
<v Speaker 3>first thing you ought to do is get all these folks,</v>

217
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:10.110
<v Speaker 3>they've got these one way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the air.</v>

218
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like tell us will take the same deal we gave you and they'll gridlock right</v>

219
00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:17.250
<v Speaker 3>at that point because for example,</v>

220
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.180
<v Speaker 3>we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off</v>

221
00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:23.850
<v Speaker 3>the ships if they had to comply.</v>

222
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.440
<v Speaker 3>You say if it was a two way street,</v>

223
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.753
<v Speaker 3>just couldn't do it.</v>

224
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.390
<v Speaker 3>We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.</v>

225
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Probably give you in the audience your business paper.</v>

226
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you'd be occupying China right now,</v>

227
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 3>$14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factor south the border.</v>

228
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.051
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

229
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 3>a dollar an hour for labor.</v>

230
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:44.770
<v Speaker 3>How are young 25 that's the same.</v>

231
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 3>You've been in business for a long time.</v>

232
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 3>You've got a mature workforce,</v>

233
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 3>pay a dollar an hour for your library,</v>

234
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 3>have no healthcare,</v>

235
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 3>that's the most expensive single element.</v>

236
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.873
<v Speaker 3>Making a car,</v>

237
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 3>have no environmental controls,</v>

238
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 3>no pollution controls and no retirement.</v>

239
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 3>And you don't care about anything but making money.</v>

240
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 3>There will be a jab sucking sound going south.</v>

241
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

242
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

243
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 3>if the people send me to Washington,</v>

244
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:09.691
<v Speaker 3>the first thing,</v>

245
00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 3>how do I study that 2000 page agreement and make sure</v>

246
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I have one last point here.</v>

247
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I've called out undecided.</v>

248
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 3>I was dumb and didn't understand it.</v>

249
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 3>So I called a WHO's who of the folks who've been around it and I said,</v>

250
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 3>why won't everybody go south?</v>

251
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 3>They say it will be disruptive.</v>

252
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.441
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

253
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:25.011
<v Speaker 3>for how long?</v>

254
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 3>I finally got them up for probably 15 years and I said,</v>

255
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:27.681
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

256
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 3>how does it stop being disruptive?</v>

257
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 3>And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar now or $6 an hour and hours go</v>

258
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 3>down to $6 an hour,</v>

259
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 3>then it's leveled again.</v>

260
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 3>But in the meantime,</v>

261
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>you've wrecked the country where these kinds of deals,</v>

262
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.280
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

263
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Got to cut it out.</v>

264
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.431
<v Speaker 3>Thank you,</v>

265
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Mr. Right?</v>

266
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

267
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Ross Perot was calling shit in 1992 he was a gangster.</v>

268
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

269
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>how correct was that though?</v>

270
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking human being.</v>
