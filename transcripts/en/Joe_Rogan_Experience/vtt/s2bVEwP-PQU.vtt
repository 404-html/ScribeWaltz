6
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>like a lip kiss.</v>

7

<v Speaker 1>And now you're talking nonsense.</v>

12
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Can you try to get that?</v>

13
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>That's given me yared towers.</v>

14
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.890

<v Speaker 1>That's many days.</v>

17
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Five or six days and you have to take time out like that.</v>

18
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.224
<v Speaker 1>That's a Kenyan.</v>

19
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>You get your wife to kiss you on the next one.</v>

20
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent no to that.</v>

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>How about if you get one right above your been been been been denied right above</v>

22
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

23
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I hold my Dick like,</v>

24
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

25
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.383
<v Speaker 1>I write up about my,</v>

26
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>my hammer home at Dick up and you just tattoo another set of balls.</v>

27
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Dicks.</v>

28
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>They do get their tests.</v>

29
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.511
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

30
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about doing it.</v>

31
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>No fuck off.</v>

32
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it sparkly.</v>

33
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.333
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

34
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't spark up.</v>

35
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to get your Dick Tattooed,</v>

36
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

37
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Have a little ears,</v>

38
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.603
<v Speaker 1>barnacles,</v>

39
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>barnacles or warts.</v>

40
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Elephant is around me and make it black.</v>

41
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.143
<v Speaker 1>Of course there.</v>

42
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd sleeve it out in dark ink if you could possibly be.</v>

43
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Has any guy ever like done that?</v>

45
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Because I know guys get their entire forms black.</v>

46
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that?</v>

47
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Like white guys will be a really weird.</v>

48
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

49
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Like they have one color,</v>

50
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>one color tattoo and I always wondered if like that's a cover up.</v>

51
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Like they maybe had some shitty tattoos.</v>

52
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I always knew it as a cover up.</v>

53
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a real bad tattoo,</v>

54
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a girl or something.</v>

55
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>So then they just blacked it all out because you can't cover it up.</v>

56
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>There was a famous dude who had that in a band.</v>

57
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>What band was that?</v>

58
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Tim?</v>

59
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Rage against the machine.</v>

60
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

61
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

62
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.971
<v Speaker 1>That dude,</v>

63
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>his whole arms was like all black.</v>

64
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times don't like recovering addicts get like the black band and they do</v>

65
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>how many years and then just go black all the way up to your ankles.</v>

66
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I want something on my back,</v>

67
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>like right at the top of my back.</v>

68
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Should have your shockers.</v>

69
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.493

72
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I want something over my roots that looks bad ass.</v>

73
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>That's very odd.</v>

74
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>It would take for to kids.</v>

75
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Who is that guy?</v>

76
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.081
<v Speaker 1>He's from rage shoe.</v>

77
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:13.980

81
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>See he doesn't have a name.</v>

82
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad ass tattoo.</v>

83
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like those.</v>

85
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>What are those things?</v>

86
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>That's from like some Japanese symptom at the tadpoles.</v>

87
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Tadpoles in the middle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is that come?</v>

<v Speaker 1>They'll come around a cycle.</v>

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>It's called Com.</v>

91
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I would get that common.</v>

92
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.801
<v Speaker 1>A Tornado.</v>

93
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to shave my chest and my arms,</v>

94
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happens when you come into a garbage disposal and you hit the</v>

95
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:36.894
<v Speaker 1>button.</v>

96
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like a symbol of it.</v>

97
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

98

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at that at all.</v>

101
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>It might be the best one I've seen though.</v>

102
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>They all don't look like that.</v>

103
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go too deep.</v>

104
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>He went like half sleeve,</v>

105
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>like down to like the bottom of his bicep.</v>

106
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

107
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>He's always wearing armor.</v>

108
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll get to six shooters on my hips.</v>

109
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get one tucked in your lower back pointing towards your asshole,</v>

110
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but just an arrow.</v>

111
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Fun starts here.</v>

112

144
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>three months to become your closing bit because you're still working out this</v>

145
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 2>thing raced to closing bit in like five tellings of it really.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I won't do the bit,</v>

147
00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you the story which is basically near is even Portland.</v>

148
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 2>The hotel is like a horseshoe shape.</v>

149
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on the 10th floor and I look across into a room and the curtains are</v>

150
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:18.401
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>

151
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.234
<v Speaker 2>lights are on,</v>

152
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>chick is on her back,</v>

153
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.101
<v Speaker 2>legs up.</v>

154
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:26.101
<v Speaker 2>And this dude who's ripped his fucking out and I'm just standing there looking</v>

155
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:28.490
<v Speaker 2>at him like,</v>

156
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.350
<v Speaker 2>like this is the greatest thing I've ever done.</v>

157
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Such great things to ever happen.</v>

158
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I guess I slept my bag in my hand and I'm just transfixed and they're,</v>

159
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>they're really fucking.</v>

161
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.360
<v Speaker 2>And then at one point he uh,</v>

162
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

163
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

164
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 2>he goes down on one knee,</v>

165
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.871
<v Speaker 2>eats her out,</v>

166
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.531
<v Speaker 2>stands up,</v>

167
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 2>keeps fucking.</v>

168
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like high five in the glass,</v>

169
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:47.584
<v Speaker 2>like go</v>

170
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 2>and then and so I had the curtain closed because I didn't want them to see me,</v>

171
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>but I popped my head through the door.</v>

172
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I looked like a photographer from the 1930 days</v>

173
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 2>and then I started thinking about what it might sound like and this sound,</v>

174
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 2>this where it gets creepy,</v>

175
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.190
<v Speaker 2>creepy year is I leave my room.</v>

176
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:18.191
<v Speaker 2>I walked down the hall and I stand outside the room and I listen and I hear him</v>

177
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 2>grunting and I hear her go</v>

178
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.840
<v Speaker 2>to my room and I call.</v>

179
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I call the room just watching him waiting,</v>

180
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:30.060
<v Speaker 2>waiting and he didn't pick up,</v>

181
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 2>but if he did I would have been like,</v>

182
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.883
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

183
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you've been bitten by a box jellyfish?</v>

184
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

185
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

186
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I've been stung.</v>

187
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.501
<v Speaker 1>Technical.</v>

188
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:47.591
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:47.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying bitten their face.</v>

191
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>You've been looked at and read.</v>

192
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>You've been read the riot act now they don't have my mouth.</v>

193
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you get.</v>

194
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>How'd get stung or do you.</v>

195
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Did</v>

196
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 4>you not know what was there?</v>

197
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.984
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

198
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.000
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what to say.</v>

199
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I was about 12 years old in Torres Strait,</v>

200
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 4>which is a bunch of islands in between Australia and Papa New Guinea and I was</v>

201
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 4>playing with a holly Patar Strait islanders,</v>

202
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 4>a local boys playing in the ocean,</v>

203
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

204
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 4>just swimming around.</v>

205
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 4>And then I had one wraparound.</v>

206
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.970
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

207
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.000
<v Speaker 4>my leg quadricep.</v>

208
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

209
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.171
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

210
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 4>a lot of pain.</v>

211
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 4>I've heard a women who've had children have said that and been stamped,</v>

212
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.393
<v Speaker 4>have said that it's,</v>

213
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 4>it's far superior pain to childbirth that superior,</v>

214
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 4>like they enjoy a better or</v>

215
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 4>a far worse,</v>

216
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 4>basically in orders of magnitude worse than childbirth is how they relate the</v>

217
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 4>pain.</v>

218
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.800
<v Speaker 4>You'd probably have to talk to someone who's been stung by a bullet ant,</v>

219
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 4>which is supposed to be one of the most painful things.</v>

220
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't wonder who's got the.</v>

221
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 4>She's got to know,</v>

222
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 4>like if you get someone,</v>

223
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.431
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

224
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:53.710
<v Speaker 4>I know you've been stung by a bullet in.</v>

225
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to encourage you to try the box jellyfish and tell me it's um,</v>

226
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.471
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

227
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of pain.</v>

228
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a kind of pain where you have to scream expletives,</v>

229
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

230
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 4>you can't just sit there and take it.</v>

231
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 4>You have to be screaming something because it's that painful and it's super</v>

232
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:11.204
<v Speaker 4>deadly</v>

233
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 4>to the very old,</v>

234
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 4>the very young and the humans,</v>

235
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.100
<v Speaker 4>we get stumped.</v>

236
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.933
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

237
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

238
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

239
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.723
<v Speaker 4>that's actually pretty good.</v>

240
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 4>We're talking very young five,</v>

241
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:21.621
<v Speaker 4>six.</v>

242
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the amount of toxin to body mass basis.</v>

243
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.973
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

244
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 4>if you're a little tiny kid,</v>

245
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 4>then that's a lot of toxin for a small body mass.</v>

246
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 4>If you're very old,</v>

247
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 4>then it's heart attacks,</v>

248
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:32.571
<v Speaker 4>aneurysms,</v>

249
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:33.404
<v Speaker 4>that sort of stuff.</v>

250
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

251
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Aneurysms fucking messes you up.</v>

252
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.641
<v Speaker 4>The pain.</v>

253
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 4>It causes heart attacks or because you just freak out.</v>

254
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.711
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

255
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:41.544
<v Speaker 4>Too much pain.</v>

256
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 4>So just the physical sensation of pain is the catalyst for these heart attacks</v>

257
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 4>and all these different things that you just,</v>

258
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 4>your body freaks out.</v>

259
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

260
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 4>you aren't getting stung by a neurotoxin.</v>

261
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>

262
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 4>There's little in the tentacles of the box jellyfish.</v>

263
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.950
<v Speaker 4>There's new mattresses,</v>

264
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 4>a little tiny poisons,</v>

265
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 4>dots basically.</v>

266
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:58.430
<v Speaker 4>And when it touches something biological,</v>

267
00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

268
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.490
<v Speaker 4>so that's why you can wear tiny little thin lycra suit or pantyhose,</v>

269
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:03.771
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

270
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.520
<v Speaker 4>as long as there's something in between your skin and the box jellyfish will</v>

271
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 4>never seen it.</v>

272
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 4>But if it touches something biological,</v>

273
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 4>then these little poisonous darts,</v>

274
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 4>fire and they fire into your skin and they inject a neurotoxin and it makes for</v>

275
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 4>incredible amount of pain.</v>

276
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

277
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 4>And the first day back then was vinegar.</v>

278
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 4>So we had a bottle of vinegar I remember clear as day.</v>

279
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 4>My Dad came over and he got the bottle of vinegar,</v>

280
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 4>two liter bottle of vinegar.</v>

281
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 4>And you just put one little splash on there and then put the lid back up.</v>

282
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sort of screaming and I'm like,</v>

283
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.370
<v Speaker 4>what the whole bottle on there.</v>

284
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>

285
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to save some in case some of the local got stung as well.</v>

286
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:38.890
<v Speaker 4>So you could.</v>

287
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh my,</v>

288
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 4>it's saving them for some folks he doesn't even know I got one splash</v>

289
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 4>was I was screaming some explainers I'm over that one.</v>

290
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 4>So how long does the pain last?</v>

291
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

292
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 4>it was about six hours before I just passed out.</v>

293
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 4>It was six hours of sitting there screaming,</v>

294
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:56.941
<v Speaker 4>expletives,</v>

295
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 4>and then I,</v>

296
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 4>I guess I just talked myself out,</v>

297
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

298
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 4>and then I passed out.</v>

299
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm still painful for probably about six months.</v>

300
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.774
<v Speaker 4>Five months.</v>

301
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

302
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 4>six months.</v>

303
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

304
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.110
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

305
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 4>it lasts for a long time.</v>

306
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 4>Not as severe as that first six hours,</v>

307
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's still.</v>

308
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

309
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.340
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

310
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.000
<v Speaker 4>it's painful.</v>

311
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Six months.</v>

312
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't recommend it now.</v>

313
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

314
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
