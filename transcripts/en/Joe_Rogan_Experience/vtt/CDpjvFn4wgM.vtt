00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.023
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

4
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.893
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

5
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.993
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

6
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.223
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

7
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

8
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.213
<v Speaker 1>Hello Johan.</v>

9
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

10
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Was Christ what's happening?</v>

11
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:15.161
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

13
00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>

14
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>we'd just say before we went on camera that I'd met a note to myself that says,</v>

15
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>talk slow,</v>

16
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Talk American,</v>

17
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>because although I spent about half the year here,</v>

18
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:23.621
<v Speaker 1>we British people,</v>

19
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reorientation where you suddenly realize I was once in a UN,</v>

20
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I hop in Cactus Arizona and I was saying to the woman,</v>

21
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:31.841
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

22
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>like I'll have some pancakes,</v>

23
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:33.844
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

24
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And she kept looking at me going,</v>

25
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.483
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

26
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to about literally three minutes.</v>

27
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.474
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

28
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>do you speak English?</v>

29
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

30
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

31
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>my people fucking invented it.</v>

32
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

33
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.980
<v Speaker 1>But no one was there to laugh at my subject because they didn't understand what</v>

34
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>the fuck I was saying.</v>

35
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Arizona is a strange place.</v>

37
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I really love Arizona.</v>

38
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>There's great parts.</v>

39
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Like Phoenix is amazing.</v>

40
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Tucson's a great place too,</v>

41
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's a wild west sort of a state.</v>

42
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those weird hold over states that have a lot of weird old school</v>

43
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:02.321
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

44
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

45
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.281
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

46
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I think you could just walk around with a gun.</v>

48
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

50
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>My main experience in Phoenix was in Arizona in fact,</v>

51
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>was going out with a group of women who were made to go out on a chain gang</v>

52
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>wearing tee shirts saying I was a drug addict who are members of the public,</v>

53
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>mock them in Jira at the right cause written this book about where I spoke about</v>

54
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs and I went to Joe Arpaio,</v>

55
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.531
<v Speaker 1>sheriff,</v>

56
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>our pio,</v>

57
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>no longer sheriff now thankfully.</v>

58
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:26.404
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

59
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

60
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:27.161
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

61
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:27.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

62
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Arizona is a deeply weird place.</v>

63
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.763
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

64
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of really nice people,</v>

65
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's 150,000 degrees.</v>

66
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.231
<v Speaker 1>Well literally,</v>

68
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>almost nobody lived there until I conditioning was invented.</v>

69
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

70
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And you see what I once met a horrendous mistake,</v>

71
00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>in fact in Phoenix where I had to walk somewhere and I could see on the map,</v>

72
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it was like a mile away.</v>

73
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.711
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

74
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

75
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.371
<v Speaker 1>just walk.</v>

76
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.060
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

77
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And I get like halfway there and people are literally stopping that car is</v>

78
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:48.850
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

79
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.631
<v Speaker 1>are you okay?</v>

80
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Because the only reason anyone would ever walk in Phoenix was basically if your</v>

81
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>car had broken down in a car to them,</v>

82
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I might have actually just chosen to walk.</v>

83
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

84
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're so white guy.</v>

85
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a tomato and used to come out with a Brazilian who would literally just</v>

86
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 1>look at my body and laugh and be like,</v>

87
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you're so white.</v>

88
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>How can a human be so white?</v>

89
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't also,</v>

90
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I never have a nice color.</v>

91
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm either this albino color or red rock.</v>

92
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

93
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no rich brown hue have,</v>

94
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>none of my ancestors,</v>

96
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the Scottish and Swiss.</v>

97
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>So they never saw the start.</v>

98
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

99
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>And none of my ancestors,</v>

100
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>my friend Jamie was over my house once and he's not this friend Jamie at</v>

101
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:28.214
<v Speaker 1>different friend Jamie,</v>

102
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>who's a British as well.</v>

103
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And my daughter,</v>

104
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>who was a,</v>

105
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.501
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

106
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I think she was like 10 or something like that.</v>

107
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.441
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

108
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 1>she goes to my watch,</v>

109
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:36.881
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

110
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:37.241
<v Speaker 1>mommy,</v>

111
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.230
<v Speaker 1>he's so white.</v>

112
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

113
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.521
<v Speaker 1>and she goes,</v>

114
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:39.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

115
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:40.031
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

116
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:40.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

117
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:40.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

118
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

119
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>like he's white,</v>

120
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:42.364
<v Speaker 1>like paper.</v>

121
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>So from then on,</v>

122
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Jamie became Jamie White,</v>

123
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:47.674
<v Speaker 1>like paper.</v>

124
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Very accurate description of my lack of pigment is curly.</v>

125
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

126
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>It's funny though,</v>

127
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>how much we appreciate the English accent though.</v>

128
00:02:55.601 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>The English accent is like one of the best tools for selling things to very</v>

129
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>gullible Americans.</v>

130
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's like people benefit from constant positive discrimination in the</v>

131
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:04.781
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

132
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a 10 inch deck,</v>

134
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>just having a British accent.</v>

135
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

136
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you got an exit.</v>

137
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>All humans have accents.</v>

138
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I've just got,</v>

139
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>let's say a cherished one.</v>

141
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.010
<v Speaker 1>We looked at.</v>

142
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

143
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel like you're more sophisticated.</v>

144
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.141
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

145
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>you're more well read.</v>

146
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You're more aware of the world.</v>

147
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

148
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I just am sophisticated and wild ride anyway.</v>

149
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

150
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but you get this constant.</v>

151
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

152
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.581
<v Speaker 1>Constantly.</v>

153
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>People are ascribing to you much better qualities then you actually have,</v>

154
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>but what does it work in reverse?</v>

155
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.411
<v Speaker 1>Like in,</v>

156
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:37.181
<v Speaker 1>in England?</v>

157
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>What is the reaction to American accents is it's mostly discussed,</v>

158
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a mixture.</v>

160
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

161
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>we grow.</v>

162
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I always think like the relationship with Britain and America,</v>

163
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm one of those police mirrors because we grow up constantly looking</v>

164
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>at the United States,</v>

165
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:53.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

166
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly staring through.</v>

167
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>We are immersed in American culture,</v>

168
00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>But when Americans look back at us,</v>

170
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>they're just seeing like a reflection of themselves.</v>

171
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:00.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

172
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Americans watched Downton Abbey and know about like the queen or whatever,</v>

173
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.260
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't that two way dialogue that there is that the,</v>

174
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:07.481
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

175
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:07.721
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

176
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

178
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's a slightly weird,</v>

179
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>so I think we feel very American.</v>

180
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Ryan,</v>

181
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I spent half of the year here and you know,</v>

182
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you come up against these deep cultural differences that it</v>

183
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

184
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.741
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

185
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:20.921
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

186
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.101
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

187
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>This is really not my culture.</v>

188
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

189
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's those moments of disorientation a really strange like gimme one,</v>

190
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>if we're going example,</v>

191
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>well this is a question Americans ask all the time,</v>

192
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but I have literally never heard of European ass,</v>

193
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.641
<v Speaker 1>I asked the question,</v>

195
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>what's your story?</v>

196
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.551
<v Speaker 1>Every American,</v>

197
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>you can go to the most crusty,</v>

198
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>right wing person coming out of Mara Largo or a kid in West Baltimore and you</v>

199
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

200
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

201
00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:46.361
<v Speaker 1>it's your story.</v>

202
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And they'll have an answer.</v>

203
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>The only context I can imagine a British person saying,</v>

204
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>what's your story?</v>

205
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Would be in a police interrogation.</v>

206
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It would be an extremely hostile question.</v>

207
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>What's your story?</v>

208
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.591
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

209
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:57.424
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>

210
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you just wouldn't ever say it,</v>

211
00:04:59.021 --> 00:04:59.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

212
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>We don't Americans narrativize their lives in a way I absolutely love.</v>

213
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:03.401
<v Speaker 1>And as a journalist,</v>

214
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>he writes books about like depression and addiction and you want people to talk</v>

215
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>about their lives.</v>

216
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievable gift t right?</v>

217
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>That people will tell you.</v>

218
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So I remember once being on a bus in Mississippi and sitting next to a woman,</v>

219
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.040
<v Speaker 1>and within five minutes of chatting to her,</v>

220
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>she told me about like her two miscarriages,</v>

221
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>how her mother hated her.</v>

222
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And I thought if we were Swiss,</v>

223
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>where my dad's from,</v>

224
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't tell me this until we got married.</v>

225
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And maybe not even that.</v>

226
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

227
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>So there's a level of candor and storytelling among Americans.</v>

228
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best things about this,</v>

229
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.281
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

230
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:33.671
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

231
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and amazing place,</v>

233
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

234
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.943
<v Speaker 1>I just love it.</v>

235
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.601
<v Speaker 1>There's something about,</v>

236
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

237
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of a narrative openness that's very different about this place</v>

238
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:42.611
<v Speaker 1>than Europe.</v>

239
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:43.444
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere in Europe.</v>

240
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Now when you talk to people in England,</v>

241
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't have the same level of social,</v>

242
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.211
<v Speaker 1>not social media,</v>

243
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but of reality television.</v>

244
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>You have some like big brother,</v>

245
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to the extent that we have</v>

246
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.431
<v Speaker 3>it here,</v>

247
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

248
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

249
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't.</v>

250
00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

251
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean your country has literally been taken over by reality television,</v>

252
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:02.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>We have a royalty and president.</v>

254
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

255
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

256
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't</v>

257
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 3>conquered the whole culture in that way.</v>

258
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

259
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 3>he's a reality television president,</v>

260
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 3>but he's sort of a game show host president.</v>

261
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how I used to describe myself and I was hosting fear factor.</v>

262
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.321
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

263
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 3>you hosted reality show Mike,</v>

264
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

265
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a game show.</v>

266
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fucked up game show.</v>

267
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:21.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

268
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 3>and Trump was hosting a game show essentially.</v>

269
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:24.621
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

270
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 3>It was a contest.</v>

271
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like keeping up with the Kardashians.</v>

272
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.241
<v Speaker 3>That's interest.</v>

273
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 3>True reality show.</v>

274
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Because there's literally nothing going on other than these people's lives and</v>

275
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever orchestrated bullshit they put in to make it more interesting.</v>

276
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

277
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't thought of it that way.</v>

278
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that's cool because,</v>

279
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's part of the thing that I was getting to about.</v>

280
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

281
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Americans always wanted to give you their narrative.</v>

282
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 3>They always want to give you the story of their life.</v>

283
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 3>So when someone says,</v>

284
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:52.011
<v Speaker 3>what's your story?</v>

285
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 3>They already have it ready.</v>

286
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

287
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 3>because it's almost like we feel like we're in some sort of a small television</v>

288
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 3>show all the time or some sort of small production.</v>

289
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost a part of our who we are.</v>

290
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

291
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Every American</v>

292
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.220
<v Speaker 1>can thinks that the star,</v>

293
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:06.990
<v Speaker 1>if there were a movie,</v>

294
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.600
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

295
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And I forget who said this,</v>

296
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:09.111
<v Speaker 1>but someone realize,</v>

297
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in life you realize you're just the extra,</v>

299
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.673
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

300
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 1>You're in the corner of the shot.</v>

301
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

302
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

303
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.401
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

304
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:15.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

305
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

306
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:16.481
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>

307
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:16.961
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

308
00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 1>that's not as true of British people,</v>

309
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>or I think there's certain,</v>

310
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.040
<v Speaker 1>how to put it like this,</v>

311
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:25.570
<v Speaker 1>a certain kind of self deprecation.</v>

312
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:26.740
<v Speaker 1>You're taught as a British person,</v>

313
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:27.574
<v Speaker 1>you're tall.</v>

314
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And I had to kind of unlearn it living here.</v>

315
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.420
<v Speaker 1>So what would be examples?</v>

316
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

317
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I forget where I read this story,</v>

318
00:07:32.891 --> 00:07:33.730
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's not true,</v>

319
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but I remember in it years ago,</v>

320
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 1>so we had these terrible subway bombs in 2005,</v>

321
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you remember for young British men go on to the London Underground and</v>

322
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>

323
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it was over 50 people and two weeks later,</v>

324
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 1>another group of,</v>

325
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:46.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

326
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.430
<v Speaker 1>jihadis tried to do the same thing,</v>

327
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>but they hadn't built the bombs very well.</v>

328
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>So they go down into the subway and the,</v>

329
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a loud bang,</v>

330
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't connect with a detonator.</v>

331
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.310
<v Speaker 1>So there's a loud bang,</v>

332
00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:58.420
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't actually blow everyone.</v>

333
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people freak the fuck out as you can imagine.</v>

334
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

335
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.793
<v Speaker 1>And I forget,</v>

336
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe this isn't,</v>

337
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is a story that someone told them that wasn't factually true,</v>

338
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:07.031
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

339
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:07.781
<v Speaker 1>I think it reveals something.</v>

340
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Bri.</v>

341
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.943
<v Speaker 1>Bri,</v>

342
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>something about British currents.</v>

343
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

344
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>so if I remember rightly,</v>

345
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

346
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.420
<v Speaker 1>three of the bombers escape escape on the day in a court like a few hours later</v>

347
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>and one of them's caught on at the time,</v>

348
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:18.141
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

349
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And someone,</v>

350
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an off duty fire officer in the story chases after them for ages,</v>

351
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 1>chasing after the guy for ages while everyone else is running the fuck away.</v>

352
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And it catches the guy and he throws him to the ground.</v>

353
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And what he said to him was,</v>

354
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>the off duty pharmacist says to the attempted suicide bomber,</v>

355
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you rude,</v>

356
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.110
<v Speaker 1>rude man.</v>

357
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

358
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And what I love about that is like the idea of the suicide bombing is just like</v>

359
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:39.844
<v Speaker 1>bad manners.</v>

360
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just impolite,</v>

361
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

362
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Or even a better example,</v>

363
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:44.081
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

364
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:44.861
<v Speaker 1>It was reported at the time,</v>

365
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:45.431
<v Speaker 1>definitely was,</v>

366
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:45.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

367
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.980
<v Speaker 1>during the riots we had in 2011,</v>

368
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:48.791
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:49.624
<v Speaker 1>in London,</v>

370
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

371
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.370
<v Speaker 1>there was one place,</v>

372
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.001
<v Speaker 1>I forget where it is,</v>

373
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>where they broke into a luxury goods store and they could only make a,</v>

374
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>it was very strong window so they could only make a hole in the corner of the</v>

375
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.560
<v Speaker 1>window and it was caught on the security cameras that the rioters formed align</v>

376
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>to go in and loot the store.</v>

377
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

378
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how deep the idea of like Keurig and make it align is in British culture.</v>

379
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Even in a riot were like,</v>

380
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

381
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you where you were before me.</v>

382
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.994
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

383
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I've got a in front Isabelle Bank,</v>

384
00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:14.891

385
00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:15.401

386
00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 3>he lives in London and she liked me.</v>

387
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 3>If I've ever heard it be up to she read that.</v>

388
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

389
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking English.</v>

390
00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:19.571
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>

391
00:09:19.571 --> 00:09:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I have a riot this and I'm Roger.</v>

392
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.621
<v Speaker 3>Probably get cure.</v>

393
00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:22.810
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you people?</v>

394
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

395
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.770
<v Speaker 3>You guys don't have black Friday sales.</v>

396
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 3>You not with,</v>

397
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.920
<v Speaker 3>they've just started.</v>

398
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

399
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.780
<v Speaker 3>It's an unfortunate business.</v>

400
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Might be the end of humility.</v>

401
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.121
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

402
00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:31.954
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to make it.</v>

403
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:33.491
<v Speaker 3>We survived.</v>

404
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:35.980
<v Speaker 3>The Nazis were not fucking survived in black Friday.</v>

405
00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

406
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.090
<v Speaker 3>There's something about those deals when people get that bargain and then they</v>

407
00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:42.970
<v Speaker 3>opened that door ready go and people pile through.</v>

408
00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:47.260
<v Speaker 3>All humanity gets tossed aside and get you in this sign to the fucking financial</v>

409
00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:49.000
<v Speaker 3>desperation of ordinary Americans.</v>

410
00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:49.211
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

411
00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:50.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit of that,</v>

412
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:53.800
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the competitive nature of those things where you're trying to grab</v>

413
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:58.801
<v Speaker 3>the few remaining items that are 25% off and even saving for this TV for six</v>

414
00:09:59.081 --> 00:09:59.501
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

415
00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.860
<v Speaker 3>And there it is right in front of you and he charge and people are fighting left</v>

416
00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:03.251
<v Speaker 3>and right.</v>

417
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

418
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.080
<v Speaker 3>It says it's just a terrible way for people to interact</v>

419
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.933
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>

420
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

421
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:11.901
<v Speaker 3>so a,</v>

422
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:12.890
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to hear from me?</v>

423
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 3>So we were going to talk about,</v>

424
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.493
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

425
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:16.701
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing,</v>

426
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 1>she told you because we talked last time about my book about depression loss</v>

427
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:20.900
<v Speaker 1>conditions and one thing,</v>

428
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it was just as me as we talk about the book,</v>

429
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I write about addiction and the war on drugs and really was that out last time</v>

430
00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you get a book that came up for you just come out in a new edition where there's</v>

431
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>loads of extra material particular about the opiate crisis and essentially cause</v>

432
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:35.240
<v Speaker 1>so you added to it.</v>

433
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:35.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

434
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Loads of new stuff because the epics about five years old now and um,</v>

435
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 1>although with loads of new stuff now,</v>

436
00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:41.890
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

437
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.110
<v Speaker 1>it was something I cared about for this really like personal reason in that one</v>

438
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:48.550
<v Speaker 1>of my earliest memories is to trying to wake up one of my relatives and not,</v>

439
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.221
<v Speaker 1>not being able to,</v>

440
00:10:49.221 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

441
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand why then because was little boy.</v>

442
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 1>But as I got older I realized we had drug addiction in my family and it got to</v>

443
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:57.470
<v Speaker 1>the point where I was writing,</v>

444
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.770
<v Speaker 1>chasing the scream or book about the drug war,</v>

445
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.623
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

446
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I guess I started eight years ago and some of the people I love when a really</v>

447
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 1>shitty condition,</v>

448
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.613
<v Speaker 1>terrible state,</v>

449
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to figure out what to do.</v>

450
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Nothing I was doing was working.</v>

451
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Nothing I was doing was helping.</v>

452
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.660
<v Speaker 1>And I decided,</v>

453
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:14.781
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

454
00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:14.961
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

455
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 1>well there are lots of people all over the world are trying to deal with this</v>

456
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:18.644
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

457
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to go and meet with them,</v>

458
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:20.660
<v Speaker 1>talk with them.</v>

459
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.950
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up going on this big journey.</v>

460
00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:22.731
<v Speaker 1>It took three years.</v>

461
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I traveled over 30,000 miles.</v>

462
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I want it to sit with,</v>

463
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.550
<v Speaker 1>people who'd been through addiction.</v>

465
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.490
<v Speaker 1>It actually led to a lot of other aspects of the war on drugs.</v>

466
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.760
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't count as important as the,</v>

467
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.170
<v Speaker 1>what we do about addiction.</v>

468
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

469
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit with the places that had the harshest possible policies like</v>

470
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:37.701
<v Speaker 1>we mentioned,</v>

471
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Arizona where I went out with these women were made to go out on chain gangs and</v>

472
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:46.311
<v Speaker 1>they're humiliated and tormented Vietnam where they make people with addiction</v>

473
00:11:46.791 --> 00:11:50.450
<v Speaker 1>problems go into literally forced labor camps and the places that had the most</v>

474
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 1>compassionate possible policies like Portugal where they all drugs when</v>

475
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 1>incredible results Switzerland with they legalized heroin.</v>

476
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Incredible results.</v>

477
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

478
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I ended up just spending so much time.</v>

479
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 1>It's such a crazy mixture of people from,</v>

480
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

481
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 1>transgendered crack dealer in Brooklyn who ended up actually being one of the</v>

483
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 1>smartest people I know to hit man for the deadliest Mexican drug cartel who's</v>

484
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>definitely not one of the smartest people I know.</v>

485
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>And I learned loads of things.</v>

486
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 1>But I guess the heart of what I learned is just so much of what we've been told</v>

487
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 1>about this for so long.</v>

488
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 1>It's now a hundred years since we started fighting the war on drugs in this</v>

489
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>country and it was then imposed on the rest of the world.</v>

490
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 1>So much of what we're told is wrong.</v>

491
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Drugs aren't what we think they are.</v>

492
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Addiction isn't what we think is the war on drugs isn't what we think it is and</v>

493
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>the alternatives to the war on drugs and what we think they are.</v>

494
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways it's kind of daunting to Rick go all over the world and realize</v>

495
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>so much of what we take for granted isn't right.</v>

496
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 1>But that opens up this whole exciting other set of possibilities.</v>

497
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.750
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

498
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:50.750
<v Speaker 1>the main reason why people assumed that people do drugs is to escape reality.</v>

499
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.971
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

500
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is the primary thing that they're running from?</v>

501
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to separate out two things.</v>

502
00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And this surprised me cause my family's experience was pretty bad and</v>

503
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic addiction.</v>

504
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>But most druggies,</v>

505
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 1>even the main drug war body in the world,</v>

506
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the UN Office of drug control admits that 90% of all currently banned drug use</v>

507
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>is what they call non problematic.</v>

508
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>So the person isn't addicted and it doesn't damage their health,</v>

509
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

510
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So 90% so let's set that aside.</v>

511
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:18.240
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back to that.</v>

512
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

513
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 1>That's like 90% that's recreational use where people use because it makes their</v>

514
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:22.954
<v Speaker 1>lives better.</v>

515
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got the 10 Hoffie sip of wine or or a or c or a whole range of a</v>

516
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>whole range of currently cannabis,</v>

517
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>a whole range of currently illegal drugs.</v>

518
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

519
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 1>in most cases there are some people who have addictions to cannabis,</v>

520
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but you said that you don't got,</v>

521
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 1>got to ask,</v>

522
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:38.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

523
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with this 10% who have got a problem?</v>

524
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

525
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

526
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that really blew my mind in the research we're chasing the</v>

527
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 1>scream was realizing I had deeply misunderstood what addiction is.</v>

528
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I had misunderstood the thing I thought I had been seeing in front of me since I</v>

529
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:54.521
<v Speaker 1>was a kid.</v>

530
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:55.354
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

531
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So most people,</v>

532
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 1>let's think about heroin addiction because that's close to me.</v>

533
00:13:59.260 --> 00:13:59.981
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

534
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 1>if we stop the next 20 people to walk past your,</v>

535
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 1>your your studio,</v>

537
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:04.961
<v Speaker 1>and we said to them,</v>

538
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>what causes heroin addiction?</v>

539
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I think they'd look at us like we were stupid.</v>

540
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:09.454
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>

541
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:09.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

542
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>the clue's in the name dip shit,</v>

543
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

544
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Heroin causes her.</v>

545
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:14.094
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

546
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 1>we've been told this story for a hundred years.</v>

547
00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It's become totally part of our,</v>

548
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.820
<v Speaker 1>our common sense,</v>

549
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

550
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>We think if we took the,</v>

551
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 1>we took the next 20 people after that,</v>

552
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>he walked past the studio and we injected them all with heroin every day for a</v>

553
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

554
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:27.731
<v Speaker 1>At the end of that month,</v>

555
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>they'd all be heroin addicts for simple reason.</v>

556
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 1>There's chemical hooks in heroin that their bodies would start to desperately</v>

557
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>physically need.</v>

558
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

559
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and we think that a lot of people think that's what addiction is,</v>

560
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:38.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

561
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's this physical hunger for the chemical hook inside the drug,</v>

562
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

563
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And there is some reality to chemical hooks.</v>

564
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>They exist.</v>

565
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.720
<v Speaker 1>They're real.</v>

566
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually a very small part of what's going on.</v>

567
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that alerted me to the fact</v>

568
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong with that story we've been told is when it was explained</v>

569
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 4>to me by loads of doctors in Britain,</v>

570
00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.024
<v Speaker 4>where I'm from,</v>

571
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 4>if you step out into the street and you get hit by a truck and you break your</v>

572
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:03.680
<v Speaker 4>hip,</v>

573
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 4>you'll be taken to hospital and you'll be given loads of a drug called</v>

574
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:07.274
<v Speaker 4>diamorphine.</v>

575
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 4>Diamorphine is heroin,</v>

576
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:08.961
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

577
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 4>It's the medical name Vera minutes.</v>

578
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 4>The stuff you'll be given in a hospital is much better than the shit you buy on</v>

579
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 4>the street because it's medically pure.</v>

580
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 4>It's not contaminated.</v>

581
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 4>And if what we think about addiction is right,</v>

582
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 4>that it's just caused by exposure to the drug,</v>

583
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 4>what should be happening to all these people in British hospitals who have been</v>

584
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 4>given loads of heroin,</v>

585
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

586
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Anyone watching this podcast,</v>

587
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 4>he's got a British grandmother who's had a hip replacement operation.</v>

588
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Your grandmother's taken a shit ton of heroin,</v>

589
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:34.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

590
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 4>And if what we think is right,</v>

591
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 4>the addiction is caused primarily by exposure to the chemical hooks,</v>

592
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 4>lines of these people should believe in hospital and trying to score on the</v>

593
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:42.771
<v Speaker 4>streets,</v>

594
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

595
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 4>This has been studied very Catholic,</v>

596
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 4>but actually never happens.</v>

597
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:46.484
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

598
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 4>And when I learned that,</v>

599
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 4>it just seems so weird to me.</v>

600
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 4>I thought it couldn't possibly be true,</v>

601
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

602
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.451
<v Speaker 4>How could it be?</v>

603
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 4>You've got someone in a hospital bed,</v>

604
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 4>he's taking loads of really potent heroin,</v>

605
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.300
<v Speaker 4>they don't become addicted.</v>

606
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 4>And in the alleyway outside,</v>

607
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you've got someone who's using actually a weaker form of the drug.</v>

608
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.961
<v Speaker 4>He becomes addicted.</v>

609
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 4>How can,</v>

610
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.921
<v Speaker 4>how can that be?</v>

611
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 4>What's happening here?</v>

612
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.130
<v Speaker 4>And I only began to understand it when I,</v>

613
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 4>when I went to Vancouver,</v>

614
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 4>I met this amazing man could professor Bruce Alexander who didn't experiment.</v>

615
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 4>That's really transformed how we think about addiction all over the world.</v>

616
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 4>It's led to a new way of thinking and loads of new evidence.</v>

617
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.010
<v Speaker 4>So professor Alexander explained to me this story that we'd been told,</v>

618
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

619
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 4>That addiction is caused by the chemical hooks,</v>

620
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 4>primarily comes from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th</v>

621
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>

622
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 4>They're really simple experiments.</v>

623
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 4>Your viewers can try them at home if they're feeling a little bit shitty today,</v>

624
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

625
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 4>You take a rat,</v>

626
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 4>you put it in a cage,</v>

627
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 4>and you give it two water bottles.</v>

628
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 4>One is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.</v>

629
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 4>You might remember in the 1980s there's a famous partnership for drug free</v>

630
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 4>America ad that shows this experiment,</v>

631
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:52.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

632
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.860
<v Speaker 4>And the rat in this cage starts to drink.</v>

633
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:59.861
<v Speaker 4>The PF always prefers the heroin water and almost always kills itself within a</v>

634
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:00.621
<v Speaker 4>week or two,</v>

635
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

636
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>

637
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.230
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

638
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 4>that's our story that you're exposed to the drug.</v>

639
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.370
<v Speaker 4>It takes you over and then you just die,</v>

640
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

641
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 4>But in the 70s professor Alexander comes along and says,</v>

642
00:17:11.151 --> 00:17:13.850
<v Speaker 4>he was working with people with addiction problems and he's like,</v>

643
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.301
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

644
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.134
<v Speaker 4>hang on a minute.</v>

645
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 4>We put these rats alone in an empty cage.</v>

646
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 4>They've got nothing that makes life meaningful for rats,</v>

647
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:23.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

648
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 4>What would happen if we did this differently?</v>

649
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.740
<v Speaker 4>So he built a cage that he called rat park,</v>

650
00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 4>which is basically like having a rat's,</v>

651
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

652
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 4>They've got loads of friends,</v>

653
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 4>they've got loads of cheese,</v>

654
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 4>they've got as a colored balls,</v>

655
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:34.550
<v Speaker 4>they can have loads of sex.</v>

656
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 4>Anything arap finds meaningful in life is there in rat park.</v>

657
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 4>And they've got both the water bottles,</v>

658
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 4>the normal water and the drug border.</v>

659
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 4>And of course they try both.</v>

660
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:43.214
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what's in them.</v>

661
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 4>This is the fascinating thing in rat park,</v>

662
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 4>they didn't like the Waterbury much.</v>

663
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 4>None of them ever use it compulsively.</v>

664
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 4>The heroin</v>

665
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 1>was the heroin water.</v>

666
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 1>None of them ever use it compulsively.</v>

667
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>None of them have overdose.</v>

668
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So you go from almost a hundred percent compulsive use and death by overdose</v>

669
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 1>when their lives are shitty to none.</v>

670
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 1>When they have the things that make life meaningful.</v>

671
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And there's loads of human examples.</v>

672
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we'll we'll,</v>

673
00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:06.691
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about,</v>

674
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

675
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 1>the main thing I took from this is that the opposite of addiction is not</v>

676
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:10.981
<v Speaker 1>sobriety.</v>

677
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of addiction is connection.</v>

678
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 1>We have to ask ourselves what are the contexts in which people become addicted?</v>

679
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Because there are some contexts where people buying these drugs extremely</v>

680
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 1>addictive and there are some context where they don't become addicted at all.</v>

681
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>This something,</v>

682
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the drug plays a role.</v>

683
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:27.541
<v Speaker 1>Chemical x are real.</v>

684
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about how we know that they play some role,</v>

685
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually a surprisingly small role of what's going small amount of</v>

686
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.404
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

687
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>We know this from,</v>

688
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

689
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 1>there's so many examples,</v>

690
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you,</v>

691
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>give me another one in at the same time as rat park,</v>

692
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 1>there was an experiment going on that everyone listens to this repair of the</v>

693
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war in Vietnam.</v>

694
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Shitloads of American troops were using heroin,</v>

695
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:47.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

696
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It was very easy to get it out there that actually insanely,</v>

697
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 1>they had cracked down on cannabis.</v>

698
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And so people had moved to heroin because sniffer dogs can't detect,</v>

699
00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

700
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 1>heroin as easily as cannabis.</v>

701
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

702
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 1>calories was everywhere.</v>

703
00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

704
00:18:59.540 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

705
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 1>heroin is everywhere.</v>

706
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Loads of American troops were using it.</v>

707
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at what people said at the time,</v>

708
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.881
<v Speaker 1>the authorities,</v>

709
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the Nixon White House,</v>

710
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 1>they were shitting themselves cause they're like,</v>

711
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.680
<v Speaker 1>they believe this chemical hooks theory of addiction.</v>

712
00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>

713
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.081
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

714
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 1>when this Warren's,</v>

715
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.151
<v Speaker 1>we can have,</v>

716
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

717
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 1>half a million heroin addicts on the streets of the United States.</v>

718
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a really good study that followed these,</v>

719
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.653
<v Speaker 1>these men home.</v>

720
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And it found that the vast majority of them just stopped,</v>

721
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

722
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>They didn't go into and go to rehab.</v>

723
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Most of them that didn't go into horrific withdrawal.</v>

724
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Some of them had an uncomfortable flu like symptoms.</v>

725
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.280
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

726
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

727
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.070
<v Speaker 1>most of them just stop.</v>

728
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

729
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 1>if you believe this old theory that chemical hooks take you over,</v>

730
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 1>that makes no sense.</v>

731
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 1>But if you understand what professor Alexander is saying,</v>

732
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 1>all the new evidence about addiction that I go through and chasing the scream,</v>

733
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it makes it makes perfect sense,</v>

734
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:49.734
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

735
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.611
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

736
00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:51.444
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

737
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>everyone in this area.</v>

738
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.070
<v Speaker 1>If I took any of us and put us in a horrific pestilential jungle where we don't</v>

739
00:19:58.381 --> 00:19:58.711
<v Speaker 1>want to be,</v>

740
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 1>and I made you kill a load of people and potentially die at any moment,</v>

741
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you would find heroin much more appealing than you do now,</v>

742
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

743
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 1>If we want to understand why people turn to painkillers,</v>

744
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>we've got to understand why they're in pain,</v>

745
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:11.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

746
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

747
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

748
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

749
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 1>and the core of addiction,</v>

750
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.001
<v Speaker 1>it's made me,</v>

751
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I learned from these amazing experts all over the world,</v>

752
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 1>the core of addiction.</v>

753
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's about not wanting to be present in your life because your life is too</v>

754
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:23.801
<v Speaker 1>painful,</v>

755
00:20:23.801 --> 00:20:24.634
<v Speaker 1>a place to be.</v>

756
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And once you understand that,</v>

757
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you can see why what we've been doing is such a disaster,</v>

758
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause the theory we have with the war on drugs.</v>

760
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Think about Arizona.</v>

761
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:33.691
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about that more,</v>

762
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:34.021
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

763
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.213
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>

765
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I went to this nightmare prison it Estrella prison in,</v>

766
00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:40.291
<v Speaker 1>in Phoenix,</v>

767
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.124
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

768
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.840
<v Speaker 1>where people are humiliated.</v>

769
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And the theory behind that,</v>

770
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 1>part of the theory behind the war on drugs is if you've got people who are</v>

771
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 1>addicted,</v>

772
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>you got to inflict pain on them to,</v>

773
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:50.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 1>give them an incentive to stop,</v>

775
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:53.314
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

776
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.310
<v Speaker 1>But once you understand that pain is in fact the fuel of addiction is in fact</v>

777
00:20:57.311 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the primary cause of addiction.</v>

778
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 1>You can see why sometimes people say that doesn't work.</v>

779
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Truth is much worse,</v>

780
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

781
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 1>That makes addiction worse.</v>

782
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Those women I went out with and spent all that time with who are,</v>

783
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

784
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.711
<v Speaker 1>humiliate.</v>

785
00:21:09.711 --> 00:21:14.711
<v Speaker 1>I remember in that prison we come back from being on the chain gang where they</v>

786
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:15.754
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>

787
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they have to dig graves.</v>

788
00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 1>They weren't doing that the day I was there.</v>

789
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 1>They had to collect garbage the day I was one of the days I was there.</v>

790
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:27.331
<v Speaker 1>But we come back and normally with prisons as a journalist,</v>

791
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.140
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to show you anything,</v>

792
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

793
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.041
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

794
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of really finagle to get them to show you anything in this</v>

795
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:33.840
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

796
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

797
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like a pantomime of cruelty.</v>

798
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:37.330
<v Speaker 1>They want to show it to you.</v>

799
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 1>The whole point is to humiliate these people,</v>

800
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:39.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

801
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 1>So the women I've been talking to him,</v>

802
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 1>the men were really terrified of what they called the whole right is the</v>

803
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:45.220
<v Speaker 1>solitary blog.</v>

804
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I said to the gods,</v>

805
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.531
<v Speaker 1>will you show me the whole,</v>

806
00:21:48.531 --> 00:21:49.151
<v Speaker 1>I was sure they sent it.</v>

807
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:49.331
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

808
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:49.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

809
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:49.691
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

810
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

811
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:50.061
<v Speaker 1>Show.</v>

812
00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:50.894
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

813
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>So go around to the whole,</v>

814
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 1>and these women who benefit the most like trivial infractions,</v>

815
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 1>like having a cigarette is literally a hole,</v>

816
00:21:59.680 --> 00:21:59.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

817
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like a concrete block.</v>

818
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:01.984
<v Speaker 1>You're on your own.</v>

819
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:02.831
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in it.</v>

820
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a tiny window where you can see sunlight,</v>

821
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.553
<v Speaker 1>no TV,</v>

822
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.393
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

823
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

824
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I remember speaking to a woman who was in this and suddenly thinking,</v>

825
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.410
<v Speaker 1>this is the closest you could get to an exact human recreation of the cages that</v>

826
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.090
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed addiction in rats.</v>

827
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:19.924
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

828
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is what we're doing,</v>

829
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 1>thinking it will stop these women being addicted.</v>

830
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It's the system we've built.</v>

831
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:29.770
<v Speaker 1>A doctor Gabble Martay and amazing guy said to me,</v>

832
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>if negative consequences stopped addiction,</v>

834
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 1>there won't be a single addict in the world.</v>

835
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

836
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.850
<v Speaker 1>What have people with addiction problems not suffered?</v>

837
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Humiliation have they not endured.</v>

838
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 1>So we've got this,</v>

839
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.480
<v Speaker 1>we've got to really shift our perspective on what addiction is.</v>

840
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And there are places that have done this that have led to incredible results.</v>

841
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

842
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:47.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

843
00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I love that rat experiment one,</v>

844
00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:53.070
<v Speaker 3>because that had always been parroted as this is the proof positive that the,</v>

845
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.320
<v Speaker 3>these drugs are so terrible for you.</v>

846
00:22:55.321 --> 00:22:58.260
<v Speaker 3>But once they figured out that if you take those rats and put them in a</v>

847
00:22:58.261 --> 00:23:00.390
<v Speaker 3>wonderful place and they don't have addiction,</v>

848
00:23:00.391 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 3>it really does make you step back and go,</v>

849
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.281
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

850
00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:03.900
<v Speaker 3>what is exactly going on here?</v>

851
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there's chemical hooks.</v>

852
00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:06.120
<v Speaker 3>They are real,</v>

853
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.110
<v Speaker 3>like people that are on sustained prolonged use of opiates,</v>

854
00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:10.801
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

855
00:23:10.801 --> 00:23:10.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

856
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.190
<v Speaker 3>people with back injuries have an incredibly difficult time kicking them,</v>

857
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 3>even really positive people who don't necessarily have awful lives.</v>

858
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:18.511
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

859
00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:18.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

860
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

861
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

862
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.910
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things that gets in your head and then you sort of paired it.</v>

863
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:24.560
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

864
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.870
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

865
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.560
<v Speaker 3>you've heard it,</v>

866
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.393
<v Speaker 3>you repeat it.</v>

867
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.700
<v Speaker 3>But it's the reason why I asked you the question.</v>

868
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.181
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

869
00:23:30.181 --> 00:23:31.014
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

870
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

871
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.100
<v Speaker 3>what is the cause for most people you believe it's,</v>

872
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

873
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.500
<v Speaker 3>an unfulfilled life or a painful life or painful self image or remorse for your</v>

874
00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:44.731
<v Speaker 3>past?</v>

875
00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Or what is it that,</v>

876
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:51.060
<v Speaker 1>do we have like primary reasons or primary attributes that we attached to these</v>

877
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 1>people that are drug addicted?</v>

878
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

879
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>so this was what my more recent book,</v>

880
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>which is called lost connections,</v>

881
00:23:57.861 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 1>uncovering the real causes of depression in the unexpected solutions is,</v>

882
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:01.521
<v Speaker 1>is about,</v>

883
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 1>cause I think the core of addiction is it's about trying to deal with pain,</v>

884
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

885
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 1>But the causes of human pain,</v>

886
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 1>obviously huge.</v>

887
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 1>But what I learned is the scientific evidence for nine causes of kind of deep</v>

888
00:24:14.631 --> 00:24:15.261
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>

889
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Right now if you think about depression and very similar factors,</v>

890
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:20.241
<v Speaker 1>plot with addiction,</v>

891
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 1>they're actually densely interconnected,</v>

892
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

893
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.490
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

894
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 1>But there are real biological factors,</v>

895
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:26.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

896
00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Your genes can make you more vulnerable to that.</v>

897
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Just like some people find it easier to put on weight than others.</v>

898
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 1>And there are real brain changes that happen when you become depressed or</v>

899
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 1>addicted.</v>

900
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.200
<v Speaker 1>That can make it harder to get out,</v>

901
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

902
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 1>But at most of the factors that are causing this,</v>

903
00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 1>despair are not factors in our biology that factors in the way we live.</v>

904
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:45.563
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a kind of,</v>

905
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't cover all of the causes that I learned about Veloce connections,</v>

906
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 1>but it causes a lot of them.</v>

907
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Everyone watching your show knows they have natural physical needs,</v>

908
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:53.541
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

909
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

910
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 1>You need food,</v>

911
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:55.911
<v Speaker 1>you need water,</v>

912
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you need shelter,</v>

913
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you need cleaner.</v>

914
00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

915
00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.930
<v Speaker 1>If I took those things away from you,</v>

916
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fucked really quickly.</v>

917
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

918
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>But there's equally strong evidence.</v>

919
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 1>The all human beings have natural psychological needs,</v>

920
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:06.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

921
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 1>You need to feel you belong.</v>

922
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 1>You need to feel your life has meaning and purpose.</v>

923
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 1>You need to feel that people see you and value you.</v>

924
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.431
<v Speaker 1>You need to be,</v>

925
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you've got a future that makes sense.</v>

926
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 1>And this culture we've built is good at lots of things and I'm really glad to be</v>

927
00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 1>alive today for all sorts of reasons.</v>

928
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Had to go to the dentist the other day.</v>

929
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to be alive now and not like a hundred years ago,</v>

930
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot evidence that we'd been getting less and less good at meeting</v>

931
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 1>these deep underlying psychological needs.</v>

932
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's think about you referred to the opioid crisis,</v>

933
00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:32.210
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

934
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:36.650
<v Speaker 1>because I think even a lot of really good people are profoundly misunderstanding</v>

935
00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with the opioid crisis.</v>

936
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Where is the opioid crisis happening,</v>

937
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:41.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

938
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Been to a lot of the epicenters a bit places like Monadnock in New Hampshire.</v>

939
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.483
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>

940
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 1>why are things so disastrous there?</v>

941
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Why is there much higher,</v>

942
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

943
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 1>opioid addiction in West Virginia than on the Faculty of Harvard?</v>

944
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

945
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.650
<v Speaker 1>People in the Faculty of Harvard have much better access to opioids,</v>

946
00:25:57.651 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

947
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Everyone there has good health insurance.</v>

948
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 1>They have much better access.</v>

949
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 1>What's going on that some amazing economists,</v>

950
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Angus Deaton and Ann Case,</v>

951
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.610
<v Speaker 1>did a massive study of this and they said that we need to understand the opioid</v>

952
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>deaths mainly as what they call deaths of despair,</v>

953
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

954
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not a coincidence that the places were opioid addiction is highest,</v>

955
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 1>are also the places where suicide not with opioids is highest.</v>

956
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.870
<v Speaker 1>We're antidepressant prescriptions or highest,</v>

957
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.063
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole,</v>

958
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 1>these things are clustering together for a reason,</v>

959
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

960
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have to spend much time in those places to see people through no</v>

961
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:31.814
<v Speaker 1>fault of their own.</v>

962
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Have I liked the rats in that first cage,</v>

963
00:26:34.341 --> 00:26:34.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

964
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 1>They had been deprived of the things that make life meaningful.</v>

965
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean chemical hooks don't play some role.</v>

966
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.070
<v Speaker 1>They do play a role.</v>

967
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 1>But I've been to the places that have solved this and it wasn't by thinking</v>

968
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.741
<v Speaker 1>primarily about that.</v>

969
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:45.530
<v Speaker 1>So just talk about the reality.</v>

970
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.131
<v Speaker 1>Chemical Hooks it.</v>

971
00:26:46.131 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

972
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's very important to understand in relation to opioids.</v>

973
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a very strong agreement among scientists that the most powerful chemical</v>

974
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:54.300
<v Speaker 1>hook we know is nicotine,</v>

975
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

976
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You smoke cigarettes.</v>

977
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Like my mother smokes seventies cigarettes a day.</v>

978
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 1>He smoked cigarettes.</v>

979
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The thing you feel a physical craving for when you stop,</v>

980
00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:02.670
<v Speaker 1>which my mother would never do,</v>

981
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:03.360
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

982
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

983
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 1>is nicotine.</v>

984
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

985
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the chemical hook.</v>

986
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:07.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

987
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 1>and so in the late eighties,</v>

988
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 1>when nicotine patches were invented,</v>

989
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 1>there's this huge wave of optimism among scientists get,</v>

990
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:15.924
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

991
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

992
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

993
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 1>cigarette smoking is an addiction to the chemical hook nicotine.</v>

994
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Now we can give people all the chemical hook they're addicted to without any of</v>

995
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 1>this shitty cancer causing smoke,</v>

996
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.510
<v Speaker 1>people are going to start smoking,</v>

997
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

998
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

999
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 1>so nicotine patches are introduced in the US surgeon general's report a couple</v>

1000
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 1>of days later,</v>

1001
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 1>fines,</v>

1002
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>highly motivated people using nicotine patches.</v>

1003
00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1004
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 1>17% of them will stop smoking,</v>

1005
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1006
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.920
<v Speaker 1>That's important to say.</v>

1007
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 1>That is not nothing,</v>

1008
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1009
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 1>That means if you meet the Chemical Hook for people who are addicted to</v>

1010
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>

1011
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 1>17% of them will stop entirely.</v>

1012
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal,</v>

1013
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1014
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:54.780
<v Speaker 1>That's saved a huge number of people's lives.</v>

1015
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>But obviously 17% is not 100% that leaves 83%.</v>

1016
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 1>The gotta be explained by the other things.</v>

1017
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's really the factors that I talked about in,</v>

1018
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 1>in Los Connections.</v>

1019
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1020
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:05.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1021
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:06.301
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole range of them,</v>

1022
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:06.511
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1023
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 1>if you are acutely lonely,</v>

1024
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 1>we are the loneliest society there's ever been,</v>

1025
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1026
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 1>You are much more likely to be vulnerable to despair,</v>

1027
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:13.261
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

1028
00:28:13.261 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

1029
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 1>If you are controlled and humiliated at work,</v>

1030
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 1>which most people now are to some degree,</v>

1031
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.340
<v Speaker 1>you're much more vulnerable to these things.</v>

1032
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole range of go through nine of these,</v>

1033
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.160
<v Speaker 1>these factors in the book.</v>

1034
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 1>But to me the most important thing and thinking about the opioid crisis and um,</v>

1035
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I find it really frustrating that this is never discussed in the American debate</v>

1036
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 1>is I've been to the place that solves an opioid crisis that had a disastrous</v>

1037
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 1>opioid crisis and ended it.</v>

1038
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1039
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And they did something that's very different to Americans are being urged to do.</v>

1040
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a Swiss citizen because my dad's from there.</v>

1041
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:44.851
<v Speaker 1>So I switched to them.</v>

1042
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:45.684
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1043
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 1>and by the time you get to the year 2000,</v>

1044
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland is having like an opioid nightmare,</v>

1045
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:51.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1046
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1047
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.550
<v Speaker 1>people can look up videos from the time,</v>

1048
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1049
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:59.150
<v Speaker 1>people like Swiss people are obsessed with order is not coincidence.</v>

1050
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.630
<v Speaker 1>They invented clocks and all that shit,</v>

1051
00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1052
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Like in their public parks,</v>

1053
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:05.940
<v Speaker 1>people like injecting in the neck like nightmare scenes,</v>

1054
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:06.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1055
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.410
<v Speaker 1>That'd be bad anywhere.</v>

1056
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:08.191
<v Speaker 1>But to Swiss people,</v>

1057
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:09.930
<v Speaker 1>this is like the worst nightmare,</v>

1058
00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:10.764
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1059
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And they try all sorts of things.</v>

1060
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:13.470
<v Speaker 1>They tried the American way,</v>

1061
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 1>arresting people,</v>

1062
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:15.211
<v Speaker 1>punishing people,</v>

1063
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:16.110
<v Speaker 1>shaming people,</v>

1064
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and it just keeps getting worse and worse.</v>

1065
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And then one day they get this,</v>

1066
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:24.970
<v Speaker 1>this incredible woman called Ruth Dreifuss who I got to know later who becomes a</v>

1067
00:29:24.971 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>minister of health and then the president,</v>

1068
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:28.320
<v Speaker 1>the first ever female president of Switzerland,</v>

1069
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1070
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 1>she explains to people,</v>

1071
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I think the solution is to legalize heroin.</v>

1072
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

1073
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds really shocking cause when you hear the word legalization,</v>

1074
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 1>what you picture is anarchy and chaos.</v>

1075
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

1076
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 4>what we have now is anarchy and chaos,</v>

1077
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1078
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.690
<v Speaker 4>We have unknown criminals selling unknown chemicals to unknown drug users.</v>

1079
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 4>All in the dark,</v>

1080
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 4>all filled with violence,</v>

1081
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 4>disease and chaos legalization.</v>

1082
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:59.620
<v Speaker 4>She explained is the way we restore order to this madness.</v>

1083
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1084
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 4>So the way it works isn't spent lot of time in these places.</v>

1085
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 4>And obviously no,</v>

1086
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 4>or maybe there's some really hardcore libertarians,</v>

1087
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:09.970
<v Speaker 4>but almost no one believes we should legalize heroin the way alcohol or cannabis</v>

1088
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:10.271
<v Speaker 4>illegal.</v>

1089
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:10.451
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1090
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:13.140
<v Speaker 4>No one thinks there should be a heroine island CBS.</v>

1091
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.841
<v Speaker 4>That's not the plan.</v>

1092
00:30:13.841 --> 00:30:14.340
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1093
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 4>What did in Switzerland is if you had a heroin problem,</v>

1094
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:17.830
<v Speaker 4>you were assigned to a clinic.</v>

1095
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

1096
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Speaker 4>spent a lot time in the one in Geneva,</v>

1097
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 4>the former president,</v>

1098
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Ruth dreifuss lives opposite this clinic.</v>

1099
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 4>I think that tells you something.</v>

1100
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1101
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 4>like across the street,</v>

1102
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.483
<v Speaker 4>across the street,</v>

1103
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:28.260
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1104
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.561
<v Speaker 4>what it,</v>

1105
00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 4>what it does,</v>

1106
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 4>it's the way it works is she should move well,</v>

1107
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 4>but if you see the clinic that day,</v>

1108
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.030
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1109
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1110
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 4>So the way it works is you have to go to the clinic at seven o'clock in the</v>

1111
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 4>morning because Swiss people believe in doing things really fucking early.</v>

1112
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:42.940
<v Speaker 4>It's constant disagreement between me and my dad.</v>

1113
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.103
<v Speaker 4>You turn up,</v>

1114
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.153
<v Speaker 4>you go in,</v>

1115
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.420
<v Speaker 4>they give you your hair in there,</v>

1116
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 4>they give you medically pure heroin.</v>

1117
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.790
<v Speaker 4>You can't take it out with yet.</v>

1118
00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:50.531
<v Speaker 4>You've got to use it there.</v>

1119
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 4>Partly because I don't want you to sell it on.</v>

1120
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.010
<v Speaker 4>But mainly because they want to monitor you to make sure you know you don't</v>

1121
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.113
<v Speaker 4>overdose.</v>

1122
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.973
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1123
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 4>you use it there and then you leave to go to your job because you're given a</v>

1124
00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 4>load to support,</v>

1125
00:31:02.531 --> 00:31:05.830
<v Speaker 4>to get housing work and therapy to the grout.</v>

1126
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.220
<v Speaker 4>Why you can't bear to be present in your life.</v>

1127
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1128
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.170
<v Speaker 4>So it's really important they give two things.</v>

1129
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:11.501
<v Speaker 4>That's puts,</v>

1130
00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:13.480
<v Speaker 4>bear in mind these two things because the opposite of what we're doing at the</v>

1131
00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:14.314
<v Speaker 4>moment here,</v>

1132
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 4>give them the safest possible version of the drug and give the massive amounts</v>

1133
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 4>of help to deal with the reasons why they need that drug.</v>

1134
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Now they're giving them a drug or the injecting it in them.</v>

1135
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 4>they know they,</v>

1137
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.860
<v Speaker 4>the individual injects himself or herself.</v>

1138
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

1139
00:31:27.791 --> 00:31:28.630
<v Speaker 4>if you were the patient,</v>

1140
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.493
<v Speaker 4>I'm the nurse,</v>

1141
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.840
<v Speaker 4>I give you the heroin and I give you a clean syringe.</v>

1142
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.880
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that really surprised me,</v>

1143
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I at first I found really weird is they will give you any dose of heroin that</v>

1144
00:31:38.951 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 4>you want apart from one that would kill you.</v>

1145
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 4>And there is never any pressure to cut back.</v>

1146
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

1147
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 4>I went there when it was 13 years after this at first started and there was</v>

1148
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:50.050
<v Speaker 4>almost nobody on the program.</v>

1149
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1150
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.320
<v Speaker 4>from the start there were like three people who've been there the whole time.</v>

1151
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 4>Almost everyone does cut back and stop over time.</v>

1152
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.850
<v Speaker 4>And I remember saying to a Rita mango,</v>

1153
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.100
<v Speaker 4>who's the chief psychiatrist there,</v>

1154
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:00.934
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1155
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 4>well how can that be?</v>

1156
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 4>Cause we're told the chemical hooks take you over.</v>

1157
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 4>You need more and more.</v>

1158
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 4>If you had an unlimited supply,</v>

1159
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 4>you would just carry on forever.</v>

1160
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:09.820
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1161
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.191
<v Speaker 4>How can,</v>

1162
00:32:10.191 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 4>how can,</v>

1163
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.860
<v Speaker 4>how do you explain this?</v>

1164
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 4>And she looked at me like I was dumb and she said,</v>

1165
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1166
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 4>we help them and their lives get better.</v>

1167
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.690
<v Speaker 4>And as your life gets better,</v>

1168
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be anesthetized so much.</v>

1169
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Which ones that's explained to you is so obvious.</v>

1170
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1171
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.880
<v Speaker 4>But it's worth just explaining the results of the Swiss program in the Phillies</v>

1172
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:31.571
<v Speaker 4>15 years now,</v>

1173
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 4>in the 15 years since this began,</v>

1174
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 4>according to the best scientific evidence be like Professor Ambrose Oxton Haagen</v>

1175
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 4>have shown that had been zero deaths,</v>

1176
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 4>overdose deaths on legal heroin.</v>

1177
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Not One person.</v>

1178
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 4>There's been a massive fall in overdose deaths outside the legal program cause</v>

1179
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:52.190
<v Speaker 4>people transfer in because why would you carry on using expensive shitty street</v>

1180
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 4>drugs when you could be getting,</v>

1181
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1182
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 4>help and given the drug for free.</v>

1183
00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1184
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 4>and once it is fascinating about this is Swiss people are really conservative,</v>

1185
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:00.981
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1186
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 4>My Swiss relatives make Donald Trump look like Oprah.</v>

1187
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.530
<v Speaker 4>And yet Swiss people after this had been in practice for,</v>

1188
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1189
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 4>five years,</v>

1190
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 4>had a referendum on whether to get rid of it.</v>

1191
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.490
<v Speaker 4>And 70% of Swiss people voted to keep heroin legal.</v>

1192
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.960
<v Speaker 4>Not Cause they're so compassionate.</v>

1193
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:15.471
<v Speaker 4>To be honest.</v>

1194
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>

1195
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:16.970
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

1196
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:17.803
<v Speaker 4>they're really not.</v>

1197
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1198
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.850
<v Speaker 4>it was cause crime fell so much.</v>

1199
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1200
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 4>It's much cheaper to give some crime fall.</v>

1201
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 4>I've got the statistics in the book.</v>

1202
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 4>It's fear since I wrote it,</v>

1203
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 4>but there was,</v>

1204
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 4>I think something like a 50% fall in street street crime street prostitution</v>

1205
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 4>literally ended,</v>

1206
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1207
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 4>There was no street prostitution after that.</v>

1208
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 4>It turns out women don't want to be on the street being fucked by random</v>

1209
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 4>strangers.</v>

1210
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.003
<v Speaker 4>But the body,</v>

1211
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 4>if they've got like an alternative,</v>

1212
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 4>who knew?</v>

1213
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.160
<v Speaker 4>But the um,</v>

1214
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.520
<v Speaker 4>so it was an enormous fallen crime across the board and the police confirmed</v>

1215
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 4>that everyone agrees with that in Switzerland and all the kind of anarchy in the</v>

1216
00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 4>streets just just stopped.</v>

1217
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1218
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:49.131
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1219
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 4>but what the reason I think it is really relevant to the opioid crisis is what</v>

1220
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 4>we're doing is the exact opposite,</v>

1221
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1222
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.160
<v Speaker 4>So they give them the safe version of the drug,</v>

1223
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 4>give them help to figure out why practical support to change their environment</v>

1224
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.690
<v Speaker 4>to get out of the isolet occasion more into a life that's more like rat park.</v>

1225
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 4>What do we do if your doctor in this country finds out that you are using say</v>

1226
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Percocet or Oxy,</v>

1227
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.430
<v Speaker 4>not because you've got back pain,</v>

1228
00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 4>but because you've got an addiction,</v>

1229
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 4>your doctor by law has to cut you off,</v>

1230
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:17.811
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1231
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:18.261
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

1232
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:19.370
<v Speaker 4>they can be busted as a dealer.</v>

1233
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.460
<v Speaker 4>It's happened to lots of doctors so they have to cut you off.</v>

1234
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 4>So instead of giving you the drug,</v>

1235
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:24.770
<v Speaker 4>we stopped you getting the drug.</v>

1236
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.663
<v Speaker 4>Most people then,</v>

1237
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.150
<v Speaker 4>or not most of very large number then transfer to much more dangerous street</v>

1238
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:29.984
<v Speaker 4>drugs like heroin.</v>

1239
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Secondly far from giving you how to turn your life around.</v>

1240
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 4>We give you a criminal record,</v>

1241
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 4>we shame you,</v>

1242
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 4>we stigmatize you.</v>

1243
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 4>We put barriers between you and reconnecting.</v>

1244
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 4>The opposite of addiction is connection.</v>

1245
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 4>But what do we do?</v>

1246
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.140
<v Speaker 4>We put barriers between people and reconnecting.</v>

1247
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 4>This is why that's one part of it,</v>

1248
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:47.691
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1249
00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 4>So there's the drug policy part of it,</v>

1250
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1251
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 4>where we are doing exactly the opposite of the country that succeeded in ending</v>

1252
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 4>it's opiod epidemic.</v>

1253
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.581
<v Speaker 4>But there's something,</v>

1254
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 4>I think there's even deeper than that,</v>

1255
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 4>which you really see in places like West Virginia,</v>

1256
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 4>Monadnock,</v>

1257
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.830
<v Speaker 4>the kind of hearts of the,</v>

1258
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.310
<v Speaker 4>the opioid crisis,</v>

1259
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:09.311
<v Speaker 4>which is we're also creating a society that is becoming harder and harder for</v>

1260
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 4>people to be present in,</v>

1261
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 4>especially in those,</v>

1262
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:12.870
<v Speaker 4>in those places.</v>

1263
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.590
<v Speaker 4>There's an analogy I keep thinking of in the,</v>

1264
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 4>in the 18th century in Britain,</v>

1265
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 4>loads of people were driven out of the countryside into these disgusting urban</v>

1266
00:35:23.031 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 4>slums in like a London and Manchester.</v>

1267
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:26.783
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1268
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 4>and something happened that that has been well documented.</v>

1269
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 4>There was then called the gin craze,</v>

1270
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1271
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 4>Where basically shitloads of people just became alcoholics drank again until</v>

1272
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:37.230
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1273
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.680
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1274
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a famous</v>

1275
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 1>painting from the time called Gin Lane of a mother down in like a bottle of</v>

1276
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:44.280
<v Speaker 1>vodka while a baby like falls out the window.</v>

1277
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1278
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And things like that really were happening.</v>

1279
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.150
<v Speaker 1>If you look at what people said at the time,</v>

1280
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 1>very similar to what they're saying now,</v>

1281
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

1282
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 1>look at this evil drug gin.</v>

1283
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Look what it's fucking done to us.</v>

1284
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.370
<v Speaker 1>If only we could get rid of this evil drug gin,</v>

1285
00:35:56.371 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>there's problem will go away.</v>

1286
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.373
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1287
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 1>We know now when we look back at the gin craze,</v>

1288
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 1>it can have been Jenn that caused it because anyone in Britain who's over the</v>

1289
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 1>age of 18 can go and buy gin.</v>

1290
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1291
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And while we still have some alcoholics to be sure we don't have mass epidemics</v>

1292
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:10.870
<v Speaker 1>of alcoholism,</v>

1293
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't have babies falling out of windows.</v>

1294
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 1>What changed wasn't the amount of availability,</v>

1295
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the availability of the drug.</v>

1296
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.990
<v Speaker 1>The drug is more available now than it was then.</v>

1297
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 1>What changed was the amount of pain and distress in the society,</v>

1298
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:22.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1299
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 1>We don't have it started brought as profoundly disorientated.</v>

1300
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going up because we're creating more orientation.</v>

1301
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.490
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1302
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 1>if you create a society where peoples basic psychological needs are not met</v>

1303
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1304
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.660
<v Speaker 1>where they have shrinking number of friends and social connections where they're</v>

1305
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 1>taught that life is about money and buying shit and displaying it on Instagram,</v>

1306
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.833
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1307
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 1>where they spend most of their time at jobs,</v>

1308
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they find unfulfilling,</v>

1309
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 1>controlling and humiliating.</v>

1310
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.321
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1311
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:52.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1312
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 1>create growing pools of people who can't.</v>

1313
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:55.831
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

1314
00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:56.270
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1315
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:57.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're constantly insecure,</v>

1316
00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.440
<v Speaker 1>financially insecure,</v>

1317
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.170
<v Speaker 1>half of all Americans have through no fault of their own,</v>

1318
00:37:01.171 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 1>have been able to set aside $500 for if an emergency comes along,</v>

1319
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.140
<v Speaker 1>she cretins pervasive insecurity in the society.</v>

1320
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:12.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going to create very large numbers of people who are going to want to an</v>

1321
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 1>fill Anita anesthetize themselves.</v>

1322
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.233
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1323
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good solution.</v>

1324
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I don't think heroin opioids,</v>

1325
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:20.910
<v Speaker 1>these are not good solutions to these problems,</v>

1326
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1327
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a crazy solution either.</v>

1328
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a line I think of all the time.</v>

1329
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite see it very often because people can really react against this</v>

1330
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>

1331
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually important.</v>

1332
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:32.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1333
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:33.301
<v Speaker 1>Marianne Faithfull,</v>

1334
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the great like sixties British singer,</v>

1335
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 1>she went out with Mick Jagger and normally that's why people remember.</v>

1336
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 1>She's much better than Mick Jagger.</v>

1337
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1338
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:40.763
<v Speaker 1>in her memoir,</v>

1339
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.100
<v Speaker 1>she shot heroin addiction in the 60.</v>

1340
00:37:42.101 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 1>She was homeless for awhile.</v>

1341
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.470
<v Speaker 1>She has this very challenging line,</v>

1342
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.141
<v Speaker 1>I think about a lot,</v>

1343
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to phrase it slightly wrong,</v>

1344
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>but she said,</v>

1345
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1346
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.740
<v Speaker 1>heroin saved my life because if it wasn't for heroin,</v>

1347
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I would have killed myself at that point.</v>

1348
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.343
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1349
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Now Marianne Faithfull,</v>

1350
00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:59.370
<v Speaker 1>if not saying heroin was a good solution to homelessness,</v>

1351
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but we've got to understand this drug use is happening because it performs a</v>

1352
00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:05.094
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>

1353
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:05.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1354
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important things,</v>

1355
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for both of my books,</v>

1356
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>for chasing the scream and lost connection,</v>

1357
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.910
<v Speaker 1>is that these forms of despair,</v>

1358
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.750
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

1359
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.411
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

1360
00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:14.220
<v Speaker 1>addiction,</v>

1361
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.810
<v Speaker 1>they are meaningful signals,</v>

1362
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:16.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1363
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 1>They are telling us something.</v>

1364
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.400
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there had been rising year after year after year,</v>

1365
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.150
<v Speaker 1>that we're now at the point where average white male life expectancy has fallen</v>

1366
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:28.080
<v Speaker 1>in this country for the first time in the entire piece time history of the</v>

1367
00:38:28.081 --> 00:38:28.914
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

1368
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.160
<v Speaker 1>That is a signal that is telling us something and that's because of drug</v>

1369
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 1>addiction and overwhelming cause of drug addiction and suicide.</v>

1370
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1371
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it's risen to that point.</v>

1372
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Are there other factors going on like obesity,</v>

1373
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 1>but that the main drivers are,</v>

1374
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1375
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1376
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 1>overdose and suicide and that he's telling us something of what we've been doing</v>

1377
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 1>up to now is we've been insulting that signal.</v>

1378
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 1>We've either been saying depressed people,</v>

1379
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:51.310
<v Speaker 1>addicted people are just weak.</v>

1380
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Or we've been saying,</v>

1381
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:52.811
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1382
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:56.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just a problem in their brain that there are real things going on in their</v>

1383
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:56.411
<v Speaker 1>brains,</v>

1384
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:57.244
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1385
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1386
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.841
<v Speaker 1>or we've been saying,</v>

1387
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1388
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 1>it's just craziness.</v>

1389
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1390
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 1>but in fact,</v>

1391
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it is largely a response to the way we're living.</v>

1392
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:06.011
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1393
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Speaker 1>there are other things going on as well,</v>

1394
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:07.930
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about them.</v>

1395
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And once you understand that,</v>

1396
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 1>you realize there's got to be a deeper response.</v>

1397
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And I went to places that had done it,</v>

1398
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:14.974
<v Speaker 1>not just Switzerland,</v>

1399
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

1400
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 1>What is the lower the overall population?</v>

1401
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Five and a half million.</v>

1402
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's a small comparatively small country.</v>

1403
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1405
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.550
<v Speaker 1>how much money do they have to spend to keep this program going?</v>

1406
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:28.081
<v Speaker 1>And what are the,</v>

1407
00:39:28.081 --> 00:39:30.590
<v Speaker 1>what is it a time constraint in terms of like how long has a,</v>

1408
00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:33.610
<v Speaker 1>a person who's got an addiction problem allowed to stay there and,</v>

1409
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 1>and receive treatment?</v>

1410
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no time constraint.</v>

1411
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 1>You can stay on for your entire life if you want to.</v>

1412
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:40.240
<v Speaker 1>In practice that doesn't happen very,</v>

1413
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:41.800
<v Speaker 1>they stay in the facility?</v>

1414
00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:41.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1415
00:39:41.951 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1416
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>They live in apartments.</v>

1417
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.670
<v Speaker 1>They just visit.</v>

1418
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 1>They just go every day or whenever they want to.</v>

1419
00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:46.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1420
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I think you can go twice a day and it's free.</v>

1421
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.331
<v Speaker 1>It's free.</v>

1422
00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cost anything.</v>

1423
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people,</v>

1424
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:52.271
<v Speaker 1>once they have jobs,</v>

1425
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 1>then pay health insurance and health insurance pays for it.</v>

1426
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have money then they pay for it.</v>

1427
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1428
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 1>and one thing that was fascinating is they found it.</v>

1429
00:39:58.811 --> 00:39:59.450
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

1430
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1431
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Joanne set,</v>

1432
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1433
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.510
<v Speaker 1>did good research on or science good research on this for,</v>

1434
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.251
<v Speaker 1>she did research.</v>

1435
00:40:05.251 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 1>The Open Society Foundation.</v>

1436
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 1>It's actually cheaper than the police constantly harassing people,</v>

1437
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.570
<v Speaker 1>putting them in prison,</v>

1438
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 1>putting them on trial.</v>

1439
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Those are really expensive things to do.</v>

1440
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Heroin is unbelievably cheap.</v>

1441
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:18.431
<v Speaker 1>If you buy it legally,</v>

1442
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:18.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1443
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 1>They did the amount of money they would save just in street crime being</v>

1444
00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 1>radically reduced.</v>

1445
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1446
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.513
<v Speaker 1>It makes,</v>

1447
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.290
<v Speaker 1>it makes the life of the person with addiction better.</v>

1448
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 1>It makes the lives of ordinary of other citizens who are not addicted better.</v>

1449
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1450
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 1>and it saves money.</v>

1451
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1452
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Which is why stress people who are very pragmatic,</v>

1453
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.150
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

1454
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1455
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the most compassionate people,</v>

1456
00:40:37.451 --> 00:40:39.430
<v Speaker 1>but they are very pragmatic people.</v>

1457
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was so popular system.</v>

1458
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's think about another place that adopted really different drug policies.</v>

1459
00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1460
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1461
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.550
<v Speaker 1>cause I think it's something we can learn from there as well.</v>

1462
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 1>So Portugal,</v>

1463
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 1>around the time Switzerland's having it's horrific heroin crisis,</v>

1464
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Portugal is having a fucking nightmare,</v>

1465
00:40:55.271 --> 00:40:55.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1466
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.110
<v Speaker 1>By the year 2001% of the population was addicted to heroin,</v>

1467
00:40:59.111 --> 00:41:00.340
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible,</v>

1468
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1469
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.320
<v Speaker 1>And every year they were like Switzerland.</v>

1470
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.590
<v Speaker 1>They were trying the American way,</v>

1471
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:05.981
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>

1472
00:41:05.981 --> 00:41:06.551
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>

1473
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 1>stigma and things just kept getting worse and worse and worse.</v>

1474
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And then one day the prime minister and the leader of the opposition got</v>

1475
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:13.331
<v Speaker 1>together and the lawyer,</v>

1476
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>we can't go on like this.</v>

1477
00:41:14.351 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to,</v>

1478
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

1479
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.790
<v Speaker 1>And they decided to do something really radical,</v>

1480
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.940
<v Speaker 1>something no one had done since the drug war began in this country 70 years</v>

1481
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:22.774
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1482
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.973
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

1483
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.370
<v Speaker 1>should we like ask them scientists what the best thing to do would be?</v>

1484
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.850
<v Speaker 1>So they set up a panel of scientists and doctors led by an amazing man.</v>

1485
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I got to know in Portugal,</v>

1486
00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Dr Wow.</v>

1487
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Killough it totally extraordinary person.</v>

1488
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1489
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1490
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.150
<v Speaker 1>he'd run the first of a drug treatment center in Portugal,</v>

1491
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 1>founded after the dictatorship and they said to them,</v>

1492
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you guys just go away,</v>

1493
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 1>look all the evidence and figure out what the hell we can do.</v>

1494
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.590
<v Speaker 1>So they go away for two years.</v>

1495
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1496
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 1>they learn about rat park,</v>

1497
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 1>they learn loads of things and they come back and they say,</v>

1498
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:54.074
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1499
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 1>solution is we want to decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack.</v>

1500
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1501
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.070
<v Speaker 1>and this is the crucial next step.</v>

1502
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Take all the money we currently spend all fucking people up,</v>

1503
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.791
<v Speaker 1>arresting them,</v>

1504
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 1>shaming them,</v>

1505
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and presenting them and spend all that money instead on turning their lives</v>

1506
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:10.184
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1507
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.121
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly,</v>

1508
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not really what we think of as drug treatment here in the United States,</v>

1509
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1510
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So they do some residential rehab that has some value.</v>

1511
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Main thing they did was a big program of job creation for people with addiction</v>

1512
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 1>problems saying you used to be a mechanic,</v>

1513
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.400
<v Speaker 1>they go to a garage and they said,</v>

1514
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 1>if you employ this guy for a year,</v>

1515
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 1>we'll pay half his wages again,</v>

1516
00:42:29.691 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 1>much cheaper than sending him to prison.</v>

1517
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1518
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.941
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1519
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 1>they set up a big program of small loans.</v>

1520
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So people with addiction problems could set up and run businesses.</v>

1521
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 1>The things that they thought were important at the time.</v>

1522
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>People like this is crazy.</v>

1523
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:41.090
<v Speaker 1>They're just gonna spend it all on drugs.</v>

1524
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:41.661
<v Speaker 1>Lunacy.</v>

1525
00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1526
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And by the time I went to Portugal,</v>

1527
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 1>it was again a 13 years since this has gone.</v>

1528
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And the results were him.</v>

1529
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Addiction was down by 50%.</v>

1530
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 1>This is by far the biggest from the British journal of Criminology.</v>

1531
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 1>The best scientific study of this.</v>

1532
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1533
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.870
<v Speaker 1>overdose deaths were massively down.</v>

1534
00:42:56.871 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 1>HIV was massively down.</v>

1535
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Every single indicator on problems related to drug use had fallen like a cliff.</v>

1536
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1537
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.931
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't perfect.</v>

1538
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 1>They still got problems of course,</v>

1539
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but there was a massive improvement.</v>

1540
00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons you know it works so well is that virtually no one in</v>

1541
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Portugal wants to go back.</v>

1542
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I went and interviewed a great guy called [inaudible] Guerra,</v>

1543
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 1>who at the time of the decriminalization was the top drug cop in the whole</v>

1544
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:20.474
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1545
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1546
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 1>what I'm sure those of your listeners are thinking right at the time,</v>

1547
00:43:25.491 --> 00:43:26.324
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>

1548
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 1>if we decriminalize all drugs,</v>

1549
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:29.480
<v Speaker 1>we can have an explosion in drug use.</v>

1550
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:30.231
<v Speaker 1>We can have lots of kids.</v>

1551
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 1>He's interesting nightmare.</v>

1552
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 1>We can't do this.</v>

1553
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And when I went to see him,</v>

1554
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:34.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1555
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 1>the audios on the Chasen screen website,</v>

1556
00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>he said a saying like everything I said would happen,</v>

1557
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.124
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen,</v>

1558
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.140
<v Speaker 1>and everything the other side said would happen,</v>

1559
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:42.974
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

1560
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about how he felt really ashamed that it's been so many years prior</v>

1561
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:49.700
<v Speaker 1>to the decriminalization screwing people's lives up when it could have been</v>

1562
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 1>helping them turn their lives around.</v>

1563
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1564
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I saw all over the world,</v>

1565
00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1566
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 1>The places that have drug policies based on shame and stigma and the fantasy</v>

1567
00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:00.650
<v Speaker 1>that you can get rid of drug use,</v>

1568
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.940
<v Speaker 1>which you can never do.</v>

1569
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:03.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1570
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 1>they have mass really terrible and rising problems.</v>

1571
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.060
<v Speaker 1>The places that have policies based on,</v>

1572
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:08.211
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1573
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:13.211
<v Speaker 1>let's restore order to the market and let's give love liberty to drug users and</v>

1574
00:44:13.221 --> 00:44:16.340
<v Speaker 1>love and compassion and practical help for people with addiction.</v>

1575
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Problems have declining drug problems,</v>

1576
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1577
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.791
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1578
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 1>not perfect,</v>

1579
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was such a significant improvement that support in Portugal.</v>

1580
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1581
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:27.350
<v Speaker 1>they've got five main political parties and none of them want to go back,</v>

1582
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:27.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1583
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 1>That tells you something right now.</v>

1584
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 1>When they did this in Switzerland,</v>

1585
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 1>what was the primary cause for this drug addiction and how did they deal with</v>

1586
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:38.191
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1587
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:41.170
<v Speaker 1>So if they dealt with it in Portugal with these loans and,</v>

1588
00:44:41.171 --> 00:44:41.431
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1589
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:41.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1590
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and helping our businesses by paying for half the salary and all those things</v>

1591
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:47.790
<v Speaker 1>like that seemed like wonderful ideas.</v>

1592
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.850
<v Speaker 1>What do they do in Switzerland to sort of mitigate what are the issues,</v>

1593
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever the issues were that were causing people to be drug addicts in the</v>

1594
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:54.181
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

1595
00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's a combination.</v>

1596
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:56.190
<v Speaker 1>They gave people lots of therapy.</v>

1597
00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:59.250
<v Speaker 1>So I remember one of the people I spent some time within that clinic had been,</v>

1598
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1599
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 1>terribly sexually abused.</v>

1600
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of evidence that giving survivors of sexual abuse safe places in</v>

1601
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 1>which they can release their shame about that leads to a big fall in depression,</v>

1602
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 1>addiction and other problems.</v>

1603
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.591
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of evidence that,</v>

1604
00:45:11.591 --> 00:45:11.761
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1605
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:13.300
<v Speaker 1>that kind of abuse is,</v>

1606
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 1>is a big driver of a lot of addiction for a lot of people that clearly not</v>

1607
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:17.244
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

1608
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1609
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 1>some of it was just,</v>

1610
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 1>there were people who had never been given a chance in life or I hadn't never</v>

1611
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 1>had stable lives.</v>

1612
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1613
00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.160
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a mixture of things.</v>

1614
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really good about this three system is it wasn't</v>

1615
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 1>saying in this kind of cookie cutter way,</v>

1616
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the up and half often happens in drug treatment in the United States are there,</v>

1617
00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:35.910
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of good examples as well.</v>

1618
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:36.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1619
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't arrive and they say,</v>

1620
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.510
<v Speaker 1>this is your problem.</v>

1621
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 1>We're here to tell you your problem and how to solve your problem.</v>

1622
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.930
<v Speaker 1>It's very much guided by actually the person themselves,</v>

1623
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:46.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1624
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.700
<v Speaker 1>People who are in deep pain.</v>

1625
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1626
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1627
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 1>the core of it is you have to listen to them,</v>

1628
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:50.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1629
00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 1>If we think about this addiction,</v>

1630
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 1>depression in the way that I'm arguing that we should see them as signals that</v>

1631
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:56.130
<v Speaker 1>are telling us something.</v>

1632
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Most important thing is to listen to the signal,</v>

1633
00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1634
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I remember saying,</v>

1635
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought about a lot this weird experience that I kept thinking about all the</v>

1636
00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1637
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:04.981
<v Speaker 1>I was writing my book,</v>

1638
00:46:04.981 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 1>lost connections about depression and started quite late and late in the day</v>

1639
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 1>that I realized why I kept thinking about it so much.</v>

1640
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I was in Vietnam about five years ago now,</v>

1641
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:15.354
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit less.</v>

1642
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1643
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.060
<v Speaker 1>and I did this really stupid thing.</v>

1644
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1645
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I was in Hanoi and I was really tired.</v>

1646
00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I was doing research for different book that I haven't finished yet.</v>

1647
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1648
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:29.710
<v Speaker 1>by the side of the road I saw this big red apple women selling it and I'm sure</v>

1649
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.101
<v Speaker 1>haggling.</v>

1650
00:46:30.101 --> 00:46:32.190
<v Speaker 1>And so I paid like $5 for this apple or something and I,</v>

1651
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:33.480
<v Speaker 1>and I took it back to my hotel.</v>

1652
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.411
<v Speaker 1>I was so tired.</v>

1653
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I lay on the bed and I start eating it and it was just gross.</v>

1654
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:37.951
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1655
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:38.784
<v Speaker 1>There was some really,</v>

1656
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 1>it's chemical taste.</v>

1657
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It was like how I imagined a food would taste after a nuclear war when I used to</v>

1658
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 1>watch these films in the 80s.</v>

1659
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1660
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1661
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but I was so tired,</v>

1662
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.540
<v Speaker 1>even though I knew it was wrong,</v>

1663
00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:53.541
<v Speaker 1>I ate like half of it and threw it in the garbage and the next like four days I</v>

1664
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.370
<v Speaker 1>was just like violently sick right there.</v>

1665
00:46:56.371 --> 00:46:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Like just in like something from the exit strategy.</v>

1666
00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm lying there in front of CNN and occasionally projectile vomiting and it</v>

1667
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:05.400
<v Speaker 1>gets like I'd had food poisoning before.</v>

1668
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I basically lived on fried chicken in my twenties I was not new to this Rodeo</v>

1669
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 1>and after about four days,</v>

1670
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I said to Hawaiian,</v>

1671
00:47:12.931 --> 00:47:14.820
<v Speaker 1>my fixer and translator who was a ranger,</v>

1672
00:47:14.821 --> 00:47:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I was there to interview survivors of the war,</v>

1673
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam War for something.</v>

1674
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:18.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1675
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1676
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm only here for another three days or whatever it was.</v>

1677
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go and meet these people.</v>

1678
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise this whole trip would have been a waste of time.</v>

1679
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.260
<v Speaker 1>So he drives me like six or seven hours into the countryside and we get there</v>

1680
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:29.960
<v Speaker 1>and he's lined up these people for me to interview and I'm like,</v>

1681
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:30.271
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1682
00:47:30.271 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1683
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel so bad.</v>

1684
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1685
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting in this hot word,</v>

1686
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:33.341
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1687
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 1>this woman who was an 86 year old woman who was the only person from her village</v>

1688
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:38.140
<v Speaker 1>that survived the Vietnam War.</v>

1689
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking to her and actually speaking that the room starts to,</v>

1690
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never had this feeling before and I've had a thing when you were drunk,</v>

1691
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.181
<v Speaker 1>when you fill the rooms,</v>

1692
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 1>move it,</v>

1693
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 1>it literally felt like the room was moving around me.</v>

1694
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1695
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't feel like I was disorientated.</v>

1696
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 1>And then while she's talking,</v>

1697
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I just like explode all over her heart from both ads,</v>

1698
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:58.360
<v Speaker 1>like fucking horror show.</v>

1699
00:47:58.361 --> 00:47:59.194
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1700
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And so I say to her,</v>

1701
00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

1702
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 1>just take me back,</v>

1703
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.700
<v Speaker 1>put me in the car,</v>

1704
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.050
<v Speaker 1>take me back to Hanoi.</v>

1705
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:06.123
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1706
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And he's this old woman's like saying sang to him and I'm just like,</v>

1707
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.533
<v Speaker 1>line there.</v>

1708
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.593
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

1709
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.141
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

1710
00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to the hospital.</v>

1711
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:12.521
<v Speaker 1>You were really sick.</v>

1712
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:12.791
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1713
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:13.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1714
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1715
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I just need to go back to the I talk.</v>

1716
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1717
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:15.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1718
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 1>and this is the only woman who survived the Vietnam War in this village.</v>

1719
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to listen to her health advice over yours.</v>

1720
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:22.090
<v Speaker 1>We're going to the hospital.</v>

1721
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:23.370
<v Speaker 1>So we go to this hospital were,</v>

1722
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I was there in the European,</v>

1723
00:48:24.521 --> 00:48:25.121
<v Speaker 1>it had been treated.</v>

1724
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:27.090
<v Speaker 1>They take me in and crimes like completely lying,</v>

1725
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.210
<v Speaker 1>going like this is an important WESCO.</v>

1726
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 1>It will disgrace Vietnam if he dies there.</v>

1727
00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:32.104
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1728
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm lying there and they're like jabbing me with everything and I'm like,</v>

1729
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.753
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

1730
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And they're asking me lots of questions and I felt the most nauseas I've ever</v>

1731
00:48:42.911 --> 00:48:43.451
<v Speaker 1>felt right.</v>

1732
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And I kept saying to them,</v>

1733
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.540
<v Speaker 1>give me something for the nausea,</v>

1734
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:47.001
<v Speaker 1>three Hawaiian,</v>

1735
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:48.040
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't speak in English.</v>

1736
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 1>And the doctor said to me,</v>

1737
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you need your nausea.</v>

1738
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It will tell us what's wrong with you right now.</v>

1739
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Even lying there and thinking,</v>

1740
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of interesting.</v>

1741
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I was where we think of line there and thinking they figured out what the apple,</v>

1742
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and I'm having such a ridiculous thought where I thought,</v>

1743
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I come about to die,</v>

1744
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:04.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1745
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I've been killed by an apple.</v>

1746
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1747
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.310
<v Speaker 1>eve or like snow white or like Alan Turing.</v>

1748
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:10.144
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

1749
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 1>you're about to die in your last thought is that you're basically a pretentious</v>

1750
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.310
<v Speaker 1>con.</v>

1751
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I was like horrified by myself.</v>

1752
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1753
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 1>they gave me this treatment and a few days later when I leave and I'm talking to</v>

1754
00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:20.524
<v Speaker 1>the doctor and I</v>

1755
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 1>was discussing various things with him and I said to him,</v>

1756
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:25.950
<v Speaker 1>what would have happened if I'd,</v>

1757
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1758
00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 1>if I had gone back to Hannah,</v>

1759
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 1>if it drove me back to Hanoi and he said,</v>

1760
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1761
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 1>well what happened is my kidneys has stopped working because I hadn't kept any</v>

1762
00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:33.100
<v Speaker 1>water in for four days.</v>

1763
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 1>So it was like I had been in the desert for four days and the doctor said,</v>

1764
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:37.560
<v Speaker 1>all you would have died on the journey you went,</v>

1765
00:49:37.561 --> 00:49:38.394
<v Speaker 1>it made it.</v>

1766
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 1>And so can thinking about this experience,</v>

1767
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 1>which weirdly it didn't actually affect my like,</v>

1768
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:43.411
<v Speaker 1>well viewer and a thing.</v>

1769
00:49:43.411 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the closest I've ever had to a near death experience.</v>

1770
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:46.691
<v Speaker 1>But all three,</v>

1771
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 1>researching my book about depression,</v>

1772
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:48.460
<v Speaker 1>loss connections,</v>

1773
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking about this thing,</v>

1774
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:50.081
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1775
00:49:50.081 --> 00:49:51.130
<v Speaker 1>You need your nausea,</v>

1776
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 1>it will tell us what's wrong with you.</v>

1777
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And I realized all the time I had been depressed for,</v>

1778
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I think about my relatives and people I love who'd had addiction problems.</v>

1779
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I had seen that my depression,</v>

1780
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 1>their addiction as a bit like that.</v>

1781
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Nausea,</v>

1782
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1783
00:50:07.301 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 1>As like a kind of malfunction,</v>

1784
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1785
00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Saying that you should get rid of and actually what we need to do is hear it</v>

1786
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1787
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Because it will tell us what's wrong with us.</v>

1788
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1789
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's a good feeling.</v>

1790
00:50:17.441 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

1791
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:18.641
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1792
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Depression is worse than I've ever felt a addiction's a terrible state to being.</v>

1793
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying just in some kind of,</v>

1794
00:50:23.411 --> 00:50:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1795
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:23.981
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1796
00:50:23.981 --> 00:50:25.090
<v Speaker 1>we need to put up with it.</v>

1797
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.280
<v Speaker 1>It's that if we hear the signal,</v>

1798
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.700
<v Speaker 1>we can begin to find solutions and all the places I went,</v>

1799
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 1>the places that have solved depression,</v>

1800
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:32.900
<v Speaker 1>crises that I went to,</v>

1801
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:33.734
<v Speaker 1>floss connections,</v>

1802
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 1>places that have solved addiction crises,</v>

1803
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 1>that w that I went to for chasing the screen are places that have said,</v>

1804
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.550
<v Speaker 1>actually this means something.</v>

1805
00:50:40.551 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1806
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Your pain makes sense.</v>

1807
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.890
<v Speaker 1>You feel these ways for reasons and we need to get down into these,</v>

1808
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.020
<v Speaker 1>these deeper reasons,</v>

1809
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 1>which is really not what we've done in the United States is the drug war began,</v>

1810
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1811
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 1>a century ago.</v>

1812
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.260
<v Speaker 1>So did they figure out in Switzerland what was causing this rash of addiction?</v>

1813
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And just by treating it seems like if there is some underlying condition that's</v>

1814
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 1>causing this depression that's leading people to drug addiction,</v>

1815
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that just giving them free heroin is not going to fix the root cause.</v>

1816
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So how did they find out what the root cause was and why it was such an</v>

1817
00:51:12.471 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 1>epidemic?</v>

1818
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 1>You're totally right that so the hero,</v>

1819
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 1>the heroine is does two things.</v>

1820
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So partly as you become addicted,</v>

1821
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.650
<v Speaker 1>you spiraling the people who don't have huge private resources.</v>

1822
00:51:24.651 --> 00:51:25.221
<v Speaker 1>Some people do,</v>

1823
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:26.054
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1824
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.021
<v Speaker 1>As you become addicted,</v>

1825
00:51:27.021 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 1>what happens to a lot of people is you spiral into chaotic street use,</v>

1826
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1827
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:32.870
<v Speaker 1>So for a lot of women,</v>

1828
00:51:32.871 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 1>that means sex work.</v>

1829
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:34.941
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of men,</v>

1830
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:36.180
<v Speaker 1>that means property crime.</v>

1831
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Some insects work as well,</v>

1832
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:38.330
<v Speaker 1>but mostly not.</v>

1833
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.300
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is actually you,</v>

1834
00:51:41.301 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 1>you become,</v>

1835
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1836
00:51:42.381 --> 00:51:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you develop an addiction to,</v>

1837
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Speaker 1>cause you're dealing with this pain,</v>

1838
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.140
<v Speaker 1>but then you actually move into a much more chaotic way living,</v>

1839
00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:48.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1840
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

1841
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 1>which causes deeper pain and deeper paid.</v>

1842
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you're being fucked by strangers every day and you're treating me</v>

1843
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:54.854
<v Speaker 1>badly,</v>

1844
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to be even more anesthetized after that.</v>

1845
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1846
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're frightened that the police all the time.</v>

1847
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is partly what happened in Switzerland was giving people the</v>

1848
00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:07.340
<v Speaker 1>legal heroin ended the chaos of street use,</v>

1849
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.470
<v Speaker 1>which in itself was making addiction worse.</v>

1850
00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:12.200
<v Speaker 1>That's clearly not the cause cause you don't start out with the street.</v>

1851
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.280
<v Speaker 1>So it was partly that I think it was partly attending to people's deeper</v>

1852
00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 1>distress and it's not like there's one cookie cutter thing that was,</v>

1853
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Speaker 1>that was the answer.</v>

1854
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It was listening to different people at different stages and looking at,</v>

1855
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:29.300
<v Speaker 1>they'd had some problems with unemployment,</v>

1856
00:52:29.301 --> 00:52:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to overstate that they'd have some problems with child abuse.</v>

1857
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to overstate that.</v>

1858
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.960
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a kind of menu of things.</v>

1859
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 1>And most sophisticated menu of things that,</v>

1860
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1861
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that they definitely showed in the Swiss model and in Portugal and</v>

1862
00:52:42.961 --> 00:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>in lots of other places I went to is compassionate treatment,</v>

1863
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 1>reduces addiction,</v>

1864
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1865
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And treatment understood in the broadest sense because it reduces the pain.</v>

1866
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 1>The individual is in anything that reduces the shame.</v>

1867
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Stigma and humiliation will over time reduce addiction for most people,</v>

1868
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 1>not everyone.</v>

1869
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Some people are in such internal agony,</v>

1870
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.310
<v Speaker 1>they will always need anesthetics.</v>

1871
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And this I think is a really important point and one that can be quite</v>

1872
00:53:07.941 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>challenging to some people that can,</v>

1873
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:11.840
<v Speaker 1>people like me who have people they love with addiction problems.</v>

1874
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.650
<v Speaker 1>So where are open chasing the scream is with this story that I think a lot of</v>

1875
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:16.280
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1876
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1877
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.360
<v Speaker 1>think what the fuck is a book about the war on drugs starting like this.</v>

1878
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:21.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think it tells you so much.</v>

1879
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1880
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.100
<v Speaker 1>so in 1939 in a hotel,</v>

1881
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 1>midtown Manhattan,</v>

1882
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:27.211
<v Speaker 4>Billie holiday,</v>

1883
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:29.730
<v Speaker 4>the great jazz singer walked on stage.</v>

1884
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:33.810
<v Speaker 4>She sang for the first time a song that I'm sure all your listeners and viewers</v>

1885
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 4>have heard a song called strange fruit,</v>

1886
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 4>writes a song against lynching.</v>

1887
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 4>It's the idea that,</v>

1888
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.151
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1889
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:39.871
<v Speaker 4>in the south,</v>

1890
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:42.600
<v Speaker 4>the bodies of African American men hang from the trees and they're like a kind</v>

1891
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 4>of strange fruit in the south,</v>

1892
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1893
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 4>This is unbelievably challenging.</v>

1894
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 4>At that time,</v>

1895
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 4>there are very few popular songs like that.</v>

1896
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1897
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1898
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:54.900
<v Speaker 4>and to have an African American woman doing it was quite shocking,</v>

1899
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:55.021
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1900
00:53:55.021 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't even allowed to walk through the front door of the hotel.</v>

1901
00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:00.660
<v Speaker 4>They made her go through the service elevator because she was African American.</v>

1902
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:06.030
<v Speaker 4>And that night Billy holiday gets a warning from a man called Harry Anslinger</v>

1903
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 4>from the agents of a man called Harry Anslinger that basically says,</v>

1904
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 4>stop singing this song and you think,</v>

1905
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:11.930
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

1906
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.320
<v Speaker 4>what's this got to do with the war on drugs?</v>

1907
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.600
<v Speaker 4>So Harry Anslinger is a man.</v>

1908
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1909
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 4>it was government bureaucrat,</v>

1910
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.440
<v Speaker 4>I think the most influential person no one's ever heard of.</v>

1911
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:21.810
<v Speaker 4>He's affected the lives of the loads of people listening to your show.</v>

1912
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.650
<v Speaker 4>So Harry Anslinger is a government bureaucrat who takes over the Department of</v>

1913
00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 4>prohibition just as alcohol prohibition is ending.</v>

1914
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1915
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.320
<v Speaker 4>you've had this big war on alcohol.</v>

1916
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 4>It's been a shit show.</v>

1917
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 4>It's been a disaster.</v>

1918
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.590
<v Speaker 4>And he takes it over and he wants to keep his government department going.</v>

1919
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 4>And he invents the modern war on drugs,</v>

1920
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:43.050
<v Speaker 4>is the first person to ever use the phrase war on drugs.</v>

1921
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1922
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 4>and he really builds this war on drugs around two intense hatred he has.</v>

1923
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:49.380
<v Speaker 4>And Billie holiday's,</v>

1924
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.120
<v Speaker 4>the personification of both.</v>

1925
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 4>One was a really intense hatred of African Americans.</v>

1926
00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:56.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1927
00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 4>he was regarded as a crazy racist in the 1920s,</v>

1928
00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 4>which gives you a sense of how racist he was.</v>

1929
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 4>He used the n word so often in official memos.</v>

1930
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.360
<v Speaker 4>His own senator said is,</v>

1931
00:55:05.361 --> 00:55:06.091
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to resign.</v>

1932
00:55:06.091 --> 00:55:07.050
<v Speaker 4>That's how hardcore he was.</v>

1933
00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:07.884
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1934
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.870
<v Speaker 4>And you also had an intense hatred of people with addiction problems and Billie</v>

1935
00:55:12.871 --> 00:55:13.704
<v Speaker 4>holiday.</v>

1936
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.470
<v Speaker 4>And she'd grown up on the streets of Baltimore,</v>

1937
00:55:15.471 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 4>a part of Baltimore called pig town.</v>

1938
00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:17.940
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1939
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.751
<v Speaker 4>when she was 10,</v>

1940
00:55:18.751 --> 00:55:19.890
<v Speaker 4>she was horrific.</v>

1941
00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:20.724
<v Speaker 4>She was raped.</v>

1942
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1943
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 4>the man who raped her was sent to prison for a year and a half.</v>

1944
00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:26.880
<v Speaker 4>She was sent a reformatory for longer than he got right.</v>

1945
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.631
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1946
00:55:27.631 --> 00:55:29.730
<v Speaker 4>she was tormented by the nuns there.</v>

1947
00:55:29.731 --> 00:55:30.120
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1948
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 4>they said he was disobedient.</v>

1949
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 4>She brought it on herself.</v>

1950
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 4>They used to lock her in a dead bodies overnight to teach her a lesson.</v>

1951
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.960
<v Speaker 4>She eventually ran away.</v>

1952
00:55:36.961 --> 00:55:38.160
<v Speaker 4>She tried to find her mother.</v>

1953
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Her mother had gone to what's now called about Roosevelt island.</v>

1954
00:55:41.161 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 4>Now it wasn't called that then when she was working as a prostitute.</v>

1955
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 4>And Billie holiday starts kind of working in inverted commas next to her mother</v>

1956
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:50.490
<v Speaker 4>in this brotha from when she's like 14.</v>

1957
00:55:50.491 --> 00:55:53.640
<v Speaker 4>So she's being raped by men for money night after night after night.</v>

1958
00:55:53.641 --> 00:55:53.911
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

1959
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:54.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1960
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 4>and when they,</v>

1961
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 4>the police rescue,</v>

1962
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 4>rescue break into the brothel,</v>

1963
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:59.070
<v Speaker 4>they arrest her right instead of to prison.</v>

1964
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:00.703
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1965
00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:05.830
<v Speaker 4>so Billie holiday's trying to numb the grief and pain that comes from that.</v>

1966
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1967
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 4>So she starts out using loads of alcohol and then she's using loads of other</v>

1968
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:11.184
<v Speaker 4>stuff as well,</v>

1969
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.120
<v Speaker 4>mostly heroin.</v>

1970
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.080
<v Speaker 4>And when she gets this warning from Harry Anslinger saying,</v>

1971
00:56:18.091 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 4>stop singing this song,</v>

1972
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Billie holiday's attitude is fuck you.</v>

1973
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm an American citizen.</v>

1974
00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1975
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:23.261
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1976
00:56:23.261 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 4>I fucking please.</v>

1977
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.023
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1978
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 4>And at that point,</v>

1979
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Harry Anslinger resolves to destroy her.</v>

1980
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:33.870
<v Speaker 4>The first man he sent to to track her is a man called follow her round is guy</v>

1981
00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:34.894
<v Speaker 4>called Jimmy Fletcher.</v>

1982
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.690
<v Speaker 4>Harry Anslinger hated employing a white people,</v>

1983
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.201
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1984
00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:39.550
<v Speaker 4>hate to employ African Americans,</v>

1985
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.470
<v Speaker 4>but you couldn't really send a white person into Harlem to follow Billie holiday</v>

1986
00:56:42.471 --> 00:56:43.360
<v Speaker 4>where it be kind of obvious.</v>

1987
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:44.081
<v Speaker 4>Say employed.</v>

1988
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 4>This African American guy called Jimmy Fletcher,</v>

1989
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.120
<v Speaker 4>he just quit.</v>

1990
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.530
<v Speaker 4>His job title was a bag man.</v>

1991
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 4>So he was given the job,</v>

1992
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:49.091
<v Speaker 4>follow Billie holiday.</v>

1993
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:49.960
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere she goes,</v>

1994
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 4>befriend her document,</v>

1995
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 4>her druggies,</v>

1996
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.073
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1997
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 4>He dances with her in nightclubs.</v>

1998
00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:56.380
<v Speaker 4>He gets to know her really well.</v>

1999
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 4>And Billie holiday was so amazing that Jimmy Fletcher fell in love with her and</v>

2000
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 4>his whole life he felt really ashamed of what he did.</v>

2001
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:04.400
<v Speaker 4>He busts.</v>

2002
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2003
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2004
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:07.080
<v Speaker 4>when they come into searcher Shi,</v>

2005
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:07.350
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

2006
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:08.040
<v Speaker 4>Shi,</v>

2007
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2008
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 4>makes him,</v>

2009
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 4>she pisses in front of him and says,</v>

2010
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 4>you can look in my purse here.</v>

2011
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 4>You can see I don't have anything here.</v>

2012
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2013
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:18.070
<v Speaker 4>she's put on trial at the trial was called the United States versus Billie</v>

2014
00:57:18.071 --> 00:57:18.401
<v Speaker 4>holiday.</v>

2015
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 4>And she said that's how it fucking felt.</v>

2016
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 4>She sent to prison for 18 months.</v>

2017
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:23.920
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't say a word in prison,</v>

2018
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.120
<v Speaker 4>but what happened to her next I think is the cruelest thing she gets out of</v>

2019
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:28.954
<v Speaker 4>prison.</v>

2020
00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:30.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2021
00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 4>and at that time to sing anywhere where they served alcohol,</v>

2022
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:35.290
<v Speaker 4>you needed what was called a cabaret performer's license.</v>

2023
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Anslinger make sure she doesn't get it.</v>

2024
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720
<v Speaker 4>So one of her friends,</v>

2025
00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:39.491
<v Speaker 4>you'll end up a van,</v>

2026
00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:41.290
<v Speaker 4>is also great jazz singer said to me,</v>

2027
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:44.410
<v Speaker 4>what's the cruelest thing you can do to a person is to take away the thing they</v>

2028
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>

2029
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2030
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 4>They take away singing from Billie holiday.</v>

2031
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.050
<v Speaker 4>So what we do to people with addiction problems all over the United States,</v>

2032
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:50.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2033
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 4>We give them criminal records that make it much harder to do the things that are</v>

2034
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 4>meaningful to them by work.</v>

2035
00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:55.744
<v Speaker 4>For example.</v>

2036
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2037
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 4>so in that situation,</v>

2038
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 4>obviously Billie holiday relapses,</v>

2039
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:00.041
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2040
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 4>She starts using a shit ton of heroin.</v>

2041
00:58:01.871 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2042
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 4>a one day in the early 50.</v>

2043
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:08.320
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] she collapses not far from where she first song strange fruit.</v>

2044
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2045
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 4>the first hospital won't even take her cause the cause she's got an addiction</v>

2046
00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:13.330
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

2047
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:16.150
<v Speaker 4>They said we're not having a second hospital takes her,</v>

2048
00:58:16.151 --> 00:58:17.230
<v Speaker 4>but she says to her friend,</v>

2049
00:58:17.231 --> 00:58:22.231
<v Speaker 4>Maili dusty on the way in the Anslinger is men weren't done with her.</v>

2050
00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:23.330
<v Speaker 4>They were going to come from,</v>

2051
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:24.700
<v Speaker 4>she said they're going to kill me in there.</v>

2052
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:25.451
<v Speaker 4>Don't let them,</v>

2053
00:58:25.451 --> 00:58:26.284
<v Speaker 4>they're going to kill me.</v>

2054
00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.660
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't wrong in the hospital.</v>

2055
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.820
<v Speaker 4>She's diagnosed with advanced liver cancer,</v>

2056
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2057
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 4>probably related to severe alcoholism.</v>

2058
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.393
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2059
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.160
<v Speaker 4>and in the hospital she,</v>

2060
00:58:39.161 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2061
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 4>she goes into heroin withdrawal.</v>

2062
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 4>So mainly for our managers to insist that she's giving methadone and she starts</v>

2063
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:47.740
<v Speaker 4>to recover a bit cause her McGraw's quite dangerous when you're weak,</v>

2064
00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:47.921
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2065
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:48.990
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're old or youth.</v>

2066
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:50.403
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2067
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Ansley has men come,</v>

2068
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:54.460
<v Speaker 4>they arrest her on her hospital bed.</v>

2069
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.500
<v Speaker 4>They handcuffed her to the hospital.</v>

2070
00:58:56.501 --> 00:58:58.080
<v Speaker 4>But I interviewed the last person who was still alive.</v>

2071
00:58:58.081 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 4>You've been in that room or a man called Reverend Eugene calendar had been a</v>

2072
00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.170
<v Speaker 4>religious minister.</v>

2073
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2074
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.990
<v Speaker 4>they handcuffed her to a hospital bed.</v>

2075
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 4>They don't have friends in to see her.</v>

2076
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 4>They don't lie or even have candies outside.</v>

2077
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.470
<v Speaker 4>Reverend calendar led protests with signs saying,</v>

2078
00:59:12.471 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 4>Let Lady Day live.</v>

2079
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 4>There were big protests.</v>

2080
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 4>They knew they were killing her.</v>

2081
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2082
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:17.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2083
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:18.730
<v Speaker 4>then after 10 days,</v>

2084
00:59:18.731 --> 00:59:19.790
<v Speaker 4>they cut off the methadone.</v>

2085
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 4>She died the next day.</v>

2086
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Her friend,</v>

2087
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 4>one</v>

2088
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 1>of her friends told the BBC that she looked like she had been violently wrenched</v>

2089
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:25.874
<v Speaker 1>from life.</v>

2090
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.833
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2091
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 1>There's loads of things about this storage being made into a movie and Lee</v>

2092
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Daniels is directing it.</v>

2093
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2094
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.090
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things about this story that tells what this war on drugs is</v>

2095
00:59:37.091 --> 00:59:37.391
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2096
00:59:37.391 --> 00:59:37.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2097
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:38.703
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

2098
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:39.873
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

2099
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:40.743
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2100
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:42.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact.</v>

2101
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's about shaming addicts and its effect as it makes that it's worse,</v>

2102
00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:45.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2103
00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.601
<v Speaker 1>Is that with Billie holiday?</v>

2104
00:59:46.601 --> 00:59:47.434
<v Speaker 1>See that everywhere.</v>

2105
00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

2106
00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's been insanely racist from the start.</v>

2107
00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2108
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:51.821
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

2109
00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:54.130
<v Speaker 1>the Harry Anslinger found out Billy holiday had a heroin addiction.</v>

2110
00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.480
<v Speaker 1>He found out Judy Garland,</v>

2111
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Dorothy from the wizard of balls had a heroin addiction.</v>

2112
00:59:57.311 --> 00:59:59.410
<v Speaker 1>It may change as I watched the wizard of Oz where you know that,</v>

2113
00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2114
01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and he went to the studio and he advised he,</v>

2115
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.740
<v Speaker 1>he said to Judy Garland into the studio,</v>

2116
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>she should take longer vacations,</v>

2117
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>right spot the difference with a white woman,</v>

2118
01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:10.984
<v Speaker 1>Judy Garland,</v>

2119
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.640
<v Speaker 1>longer vacations with Billie holiday,</v>

2120
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>fucking destroy her,</v>

2121
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2122
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2123
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>if at one of the agents he sent to destroy her and my uncle George White,</v>

2124
01:00:17.771 --> 01:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>who has got a tractor in the last days of her life,</v>

2125
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:20.981
<v Speaker 1>we now know,</v>

2126
01:00:20.981 --> 01:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2127
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:22.900
<v Speaker 1>he's literally a psychopath.</v>

2128
01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>He was a hugely obese guys across strange guy.</v>

2129
01:00:25.931 --> 01:00:28.180
<v Speaker 1>He infiltrated a Chinese drug gang when he wasn't Chinese.</v>

2130
01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Any person to ever do that.</v>

2131
01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:29.861
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

2132
01:00:29.861 --> 01:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2133
01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:32.950
<v Speaker 1>he boasted in his diary about murdering people,</v>

2134
01:00:32.951 --> 01:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>about spiking women and raping them.</v>

2135
01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2136
01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.880
<v Speaker 1>these were really deranged people that were,</v>

2137
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>that founded the the drug will.</v>

2138
01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I say in relation to what we were just talking about is because</v>

2139
01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.220
<v Speaker 1>in this culture,</v>

2140
01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:48.850
<v Speaker 1>we tell only one heroic story about people with addiction problems,</v>

2141
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's what they sometimes recover from their addiction.</v>

2142
01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>That is indeed a heroic story.</v>

2143
01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Everyone watching this has been,</v>

2144
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>who's managed to do that is a hero and I massively love and congratulate them,</v>

2145
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>but that is not the only heroic story we should tell about people with addiction</v>

2146
01:01:02.411 --> 01:01:03.244
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

2147
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Billie holiday never stopped using drugs.</v>

2148
01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>She was still a fucking hero.</v>

2149
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>She any,</v>

2150
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>she never let these people stop her singing that song.</v>

2151
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>She would go to the places where you didn't have a license,</v>

2152
01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to the worst parts of the deep south.</v>

2153
01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>She sang strange fruit.</v>

2154
01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>They people threw bottles at had they stopped out cigarettes on her.</v>

2155
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>She never stopped singing that song.</v>

2156
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.633
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2157
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think about Billie Holiday a lot.</v>

2158
01:01:26.981 --> 01:01:27.814
<v Speaker 1>And I think about,</v>

2159
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.273
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2160
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>all over the world,</v>

2161
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.490
<v Speaker 1>every day people listen to Billie holiday and they feel stronger and all over</v>

2162
01:01:36.491 --> 01:01:36.851
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

2163
01:01:36.851 --> 01:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>every day we are still following the policies of Harry Anslinger and it makes us</v>

2164
01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:41.164
<v Speaker 1>weaker.</v>

2165
01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And this conflict that begins right at the start of the drug.</v>

2166
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think if I'm honest,</v>

2167
01:01:47.441 --> 01:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I think this isn't an easy thing to say,</v>

2168
01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:55.291
<v Speaker 1>but I think one of the reasons why the debate about the drug wars so charged is</v>

2169
01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>because it runs through the hearts of all of us,</v>

2170
01:01:56.861 --> 01:01:57.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2171
01:01:57.041 --> 01:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who's got someone they love has got an addiction problem as I do</v>

2172
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>a Harry Anslinger in your head,</v>

2173
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:04.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2174
01:02:04.301 --> 01:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit of view that looks at them and thinks someone should just fucking</v>

2175
01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>stop here.</v>

2176
01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing this?</v>

2177
01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Someone should stop you doing this.</v>

2178
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>And then for most people,</v>

2179
01:02:12.071 --> 01:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>there's another part that's like,</v>

2180
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2181
01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that anger isn't useful in most cases.</v>

2182
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:18.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2183
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>actually what you're doing this for a reason.</v>

2184
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>We need to understand those reasons.</v>

2185
01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>We need to help you to change your life,</v>

2186
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:24.774
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2187
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>But that conflict is,</v>

2188
01:02:26.811 --> 01:02:27.041
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2189
01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>is very deep in us.</v>

2190
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And Harry Anslinger the war he invented.</v>

2191
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>And we can talk about what he did with cannabis and lots of other things,</v>

2192
01:02:33.841 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but because he invented the ban on cannabis,</v>

2193
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>that that war is,</v>

2194
01:02:39.681 --> 01:02:40.291
<v Speaker 1>is still playing it.</v>

2195
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:40.921
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

2196
01:02:40.921 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I know that was a long answer,</v>

2197
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's all right.</v>

2198
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:43.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2199
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>it does make sense of it.</v>

2200
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrific story about Billy all day.</v>

2201
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And I had no idea that I'm Dorothy from the wizard of Oz was also addicted.</v>

2202
01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

2203
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>The munchkins a lot of them as well.</v>

2204
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2205
01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Harry W W W why was Harry Anslinger is hate towards her so extreme.</v>

2206
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So when he was a kid,</v>

2207
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the book is called chasing the screen.</v>

2208
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:05.101
<v Speaker 1>Cause when he was a kid,</v>

2209
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 1>he grew up in a place called Altoona in Pennsylvania.</v>

2210
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

2211
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.380
<v Speaker 1>he lives in a farm house.</v>

2212
01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:13.020
<v Speaker 1>His Dad was actually a refugee from swell refugee and a bit comes immigrant from</v>

2213
01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:13.854
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

2214
01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2215
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and they grew up in this farm house.</v>

2216
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And in the next farm house down there was a,</v>

2217
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.151
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2218
01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:21.984
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2219
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.221
<v Speaker 1>a farmer's wife.</v>

2220
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>You had an a heroin addiction or methods,</v>

2221
01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:25.381
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

2222
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 1>morphine addiction would've been hiring them.</v>

2223
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And Harry Anslinger had this really haunting memory of going to that house and</v>

2224
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:35.750
<v Speaker 1>hearing this woman's scream and scream and him being sent to take the wholesome,</v>

2225
01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 11 or something being sent to tight,</v>

2226
01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>the Holston caught into town to go to the pharmacy to get her the morphine and</v>

2227
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>then bringing it back in her scream,</v>

2228
01:03:42.641 --> 01:03:43.474
<v Speaker 1>stopping.</v>

2229
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 1>The lesson he took from that is these drugs are evil and we need to destroy</v>

2230
01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:47.424
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2231
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Especially later on.</v>

2232
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2233
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>he was in Europe during the first world war and he had this very keen,</v>

2234
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:54.403
<v Speaker 1>was a diplomat.</v>

2235
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>We had this very keen sense that civilization was incredibly fragile.</v>

2236
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It could collapse at any moment,</v>

2237
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>that you only need a little bit of contamination and it will all go to shit.</v>

2238
01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2239
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:06.721
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2240
01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:07.001
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2241
01:04:07.001 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and so he,</v>

2242
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2243
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:09.811
<v Speaker 1>I call it chasing the screen.</v>

2244
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think in a way what Harry Anslinger is doing is like chasing the scream</v>

2245
01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:13.291
<v Speaker 1>all over the world.</v>

2246
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:13.711
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like,</v>

2247
01:04:13.711 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2248
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:14.401
<v Speaker 1>I was doing,</v>

2249
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>going to all these different places from the killing fields in Mexico to</v>

2250
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:17.761
<v Speaker 1>Portugal.</v>

2251
01:04:17.761 --> 01:04:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And Switzerland was like,</v>

2252
01:04:19.351 --> 01:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>following this scream as it kind of ricocheted around.</v>

2253
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And actually how he made he thinks he's stopping these screams is actually</v>

2254
01:04:25.471 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 1>creating far more screams in their,</v>

2255
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.321
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>

2256
01:04:28.321 --> 01:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>in their place.</v>

2257
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:30.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>But I still don't understand why he had this intensity holiday so,</v>

2259
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2260
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>she's an African American woman standing up to white supremacy who has an</v>

2261
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>addiction problem.</v>

2262
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.580
<v Speaker 1>But the truth is what he did to Billie holiday is not a party.</v>

2263
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.833
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2264
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.290
<v Speaker 1>this is what you did to African Americans and people with addiction problems.</v>

2265
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:46.911
<v Speaker 1>Billie holiday.</v>

2266
01:04:46.911 --> 01:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It happens to be famous.</v>

2267
01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling her story,</v>

2268
01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but this is what he did to huge numbers of people,</v>

2269
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2270
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.940
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to destroy the whole jazz scene.</v>

2271
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>One of the amazing thing is spending time in his,</v>

2272
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2273
01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:00.750
<v Speaker 1>archives in Penn state was seeing all these memos from,</v>

2274
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2275
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>his agents.</v>

2276
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:02.551
<v Speaker 1>We said to them,</v>

2277
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 1>go to your local jazz club,</v>

2278
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>document the evil things that happening there and the things they wrote back.</v>

2279
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I caught a hilarious,</v>

2280
01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:08.881
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2281
01:05:08.881 --> 01:05:10.410
<v Speaker 1>there's one agent who,</v>

2282
01:05:10.411 --> 01:05:11.071
<v Speaker 1>I forget where it was,</v>

2283
01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>but he wrote back and was like,</v>

2284
01:05:12.511 --> 01:05:13.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2285
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>there was a popular jazz song at the time called,</v>

2286
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2287
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that ocean ma'am,</v>

2288
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and had a lyric that said,</v>

2289
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 4>when he gets the notion,</v>

2290
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 4>he thinks he can walk across the ocean.</v>

2291
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2292
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 4>there was gonna be an epidemic of drowning across the United States as people</v>

2293
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 4>use cannabis because they're going to believe they can walk on water.</v>

2294
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.430
<v Speaker 4>So he would,</v>

2295
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:31.263
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

2296
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2297
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.231
<v Speaker 4>you're the hilarious.</v>

2298
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:33.064
<v Speaker 4>We were things he said,</v>

2299
01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2300
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.010
<v Speaker 4>he believed that when you smoke cannabis,</v>

2301
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 4>time slows down.</v>

2302
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:39.460
<v Speaker 4>So a minute seems to last a thousand years.</v>

2303
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Like these extraordinarily heightened,</v>

2304
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 4>crazy things that he would,</v>

2305
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 4>he would say.</v>

2306
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:44.621
<v Speaker 4>And he actually latched.</v>

2307
01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 4>So at that time when he first takes over what becomes the Federal Bureau of</v>

2308
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 4>narcotics,</v>

2309
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2310
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:52.180
<v Speaker 4>cocaine and heroin start very popular,</v>

2311
01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:52.421
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2312
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:53.920
<v Speaker 4>There's just not much of a war to fight.</v>

2313
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.161
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2314
01:05:54.161 --> 01:05:54.671
<v Speaker 4>they exist,</v>

2315
01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 4>but they're not that popular quite that can find a small urban scenes.</v>

2316
01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Cannabis was more popular,</v>

2317
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:00.370
<v Speaker 4>not as popular as it is now,</v>

2318
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.860
<v Speaker 4>but an,</v>

2319
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 4>and he had previously said,</v>

2320
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 4>cannabis isn't harmful,</v>

2321
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:07.540
<v Speaker 4>not bothered about it.</v>

2322
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.411
<v Speaker 4>He suddenly,</v>

2323
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 4>when he cottons on that,</v>

2324
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 4>this is the way to big buildup his department,</v>

2325
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.880
<v Speaker 4>he announces that cannabis is,</v>

2326
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.280
<v Speaker 4>the phrase he used was the most evil drug in the world.</v>

2327
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 4>He said when Frankenstein's monster bumps into a spliff on the staircase,</v>

2328
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:21.400
<v Speaker 4>Frankenstein's monster dies of fright,</v>

2329
01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 4>like at extraordinarily heightened claims.</v>

2330
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.533
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2331
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.373
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2332
01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:26.920
<v Speaker 4>and any,</v>

2333
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.740
<v Speaker 4>any issues just trying to get support for a ban on cannabis.</v>

2334
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 4>And he latches onto one case in particular.</v>

2335
01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:32.981
<v Speaker 4>I some point,</v>

2336
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 4>cause I think we're hearing these again,</v>

2337
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 4>these things again now.</v>

2338
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2339
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.330
<v Speaker 4>so a kid in Tampa,</v>

2340
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Florida called Victor Lacarta,</v>

2341
01:06:38.921 --> 01:06:40.000
<v Speaker 4>who was not so much a kid,</v>

2342
01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 4>21 killed his entire family with an ax,</v>

2343
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 4>but should the mall and with the help of the Fox News of its time,</v>

2344
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Speaker 4>Hearst,</v>

2345
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.340
<v Speaker 4>Hearst newspapers,</v>

2346
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:49.743
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2347
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 4>Anslinger announces this is what will happen if you use cannabis.</v>

2348
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.861
<v Speaker 4>Literally,</v>

2349
01:06:53.861 --> 01:06:55.750
<v Speaker 4>you will kill your family with an ax.</v>

2350
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.673
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2351
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 4>And this becomes a very famous story across the United States.</v>

2352
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:01.030
<v Speaker 4>And cannabis is banned in its wake.</v>

2353
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.871
<v Speaker 4>Years later,</v>

2354
01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 4>someone goes and checks the psychiatric files for bit till I kind of,</v>

2355
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.340
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even evidence it'd be used cannabis,</v>

2356
01:07:06.341 --> 01:07:06.760
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2357
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.190
<v Speaker 4>is he'd had terrible problems with psychosis.</v>

2358
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:12.040
<v Speaker 4>His family had been advised more than a year before that he should be</v>

2359
01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:13.420
<v Speaker 4>institutionalized and they refused.</v>

2360
01:07:13.421 --> 01:07:14.111
<v Speaker 4>They kept him at home.</v>

2361
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 4>And this tragedy ensued.</v>

2362
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 4>We're hearing these,</v>

2363
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:19.240
<v Speaker 4>these scare stories again about,</v>

2364
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 4>about cannabis as something that Anslinger said that I think could be like the</v>

2365
01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:27.571
<v Speaker 4>motto for the entire drug war in the wake of the Anslinger introduces this ban</v>

2366
01:07:28.071 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 4>in the u s he promises drugs will disappear,</v>

2367
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:31.623
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2368
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 4>You will notice drugs did not disappear.</v>

2369
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:34.421
<v Speaker 4>He starts to say,</v>

2370
01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:35.470
<v Speaker 4>well that's just cause evil.</v>

2371
01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:38.650
<v Speaker 4>Foreign countries like Mexico are flooding our country with drugs.</v>

2372
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:39.940
<v Speaker 4>You'll notice that's come back as well.</v>

2373
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2374
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.660
<v Speaker 4>so what we need to do is force all these other countries to band them as well,</v>

2375
01:07:43.661 --> 01:07:44.680
<v Speaker 4>and then they'll disappear.</v>

2376
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.200
<v Speaker 4>So the u s in the wake of the Second World War where it has the power to do</v>

2377
01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:47.300
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2378
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 4>the world is in ruins.</v>

2379
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2380
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.840
<v Speaker 4>and there's one point when he goes to the new United Nations and he's insisting</v>

2381
01:07:52.841 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 4>this happens and they're basically threatening people.</v>

2382
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:55.444
<v Speaker 4>They're saying,</v>

2383
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.930
<v Speaker 4>we'll cut off your foreign aid or you won't be allowed to sell goods to the US</v>

2384
01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:00.550
<v Speaker 4>market if you don't do this.</v>

2385
01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.950
<v Speaker 4>The ambassador from Thailand is like,</v>

2386
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:03.461
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2387
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:03.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2388
01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:05.320
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem to work very well in your country.</v>

2389
01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:07.800
<v Speaker 4>We've actually got a long pattern of established drug use in,</v>

2390
01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:08.711
<v Speaker 4>in Thailand.</v>

2391
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 4>We don't really have many problems.</v>

2392
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:11.600
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to do this and answer thing.</v>

2393
01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:12.434
<v Speaker 4>I said to her,</v>

2394
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:13.293
<v Speaker 4>I said to him,</v>

2395
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:14.770
<v Speaker 4>I've made up my mind,</v>

2396
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 4>don't try to confuse</v>

2397
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>me with the facts.</v>

2398
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And I always feel like that's the drug war.</v>

2399
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2400
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>And made up my mind,</v>

2401
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>don't try to confuse me with the facts.</v>

2402
01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>While he,</v>

2403
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>in conjunction with a William Randolph Hearst,</v>

2404
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.960
<v Speaker 1>he worked with him to try to propagate these ridiculous propaganda stories about</v>

2405
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:37.781
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans and blacks smoking this evil drug called marijuana,</v>

2406
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 1>which is really not even a real term for cannabis at the time.</v>

2407
01:08:41.631 --> 01:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>It was a sound.</v>

2408
01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>It's wild.</v>

2409
01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a wild Mexican tobacco,</v>

2411
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2412
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2414
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.360
<v Speaker 1>but then didn't Nixon do a similar thing with the sweeping psychedelic act of</v>

2415
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 1>1970 he did it so that they could infiltrate the civil rights movement because</v>

2416
01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:00.650
<v Speaker 1>there were so many people in the civil rights movement that we're using various</v>

2417
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.970
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs.</v>

2418
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.660
<v Speaker 1>They could use it as an excuse to crack down on them and lock them up and put</v>

2419
01:09:05.661 --> 01:09:08.050
<v Speaker 1>them in jail and pit them against each other and you know,</v>

2420
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>have them inform on each other.</v>

2421
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2422
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.970
<v Speaker 1>This is really important.</v>

2423
01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 1>You cannot enforce the drug laws against everyone who's broken than it is</v>

2424
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:15.223
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

2425
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Half of all Americans by conservative estimate of broken the drug laws.</v>

2426
01:09:18.481 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2427
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do everywhere in the world?</v>

2428
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 1>The drug laws are used to persecute groups.</v>

2429
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 1>The state wants to persecute him for other reasons,</v>

2430
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:26.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2431
01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 1>So one of the people I wrote about in chasing the scream is a wound.</v>

2433
01:09:30.891 --> 01:09:32.840
<v Speaker 1>He really had a kind of epiphany about this,</v>

2434
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:33.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2435
01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>So Lee Maddox was a cop in Baltimore.</v>

2436
01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 1>She used to do the [inaudible] she would,</v>

2437
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 1>and she would very proudly bust people who even had a single joint.</v>

2438
01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2439
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.630
<v Speaker 1>She was a real Harry answering his dream go.</v>

2440
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And she had signed up to become a cop,</v>

2441
01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>

2442
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2443
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

2444
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:51.080
<v Speaker 1>she'd signed up to come cop for quite personal reason as a kid.</v>

2445
01:09:51.081 --> 01:09:51.914
<v Speaker 1>She'd had a best friend,</v>

2446
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.730
<v Speaker 1>couldn't teenager called Elisa.</v>

2447
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2448
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.970
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2449
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>they looked really similar.</v>

2450
01:09:56.961 --> 01:09:58.220
<v Speaker 1>They shared a fake Id.</v>

2451
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 1>They were like sisters.</v>

2452
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And one day when they were in the late teens,</v>

2453
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:07.571
<v Speaker 1>they went to ocean city for day out and Lisa decided to hitchhike back to New</v>

2454
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:08.743
<v Speaker 1>Jersey where she lived.</v>

2455
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.883
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2456
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 1>so Lisa bye to her and the next day she gets a call saying,</v>

2457
01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Lisa had not arrived.</v>

2458
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>So she waits and way.</v>

2459
01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just this terrible summer waiting to find out what happened.</v>

2460
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And then they discovered that Lisa had been gang raped and murdered at body,</v>

2461
01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:26.720
<v Speaker 1>was found underneath the house where had been eaten by animals.</v>

2462
01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:27.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2463
01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and Lee becomes,</v>

2464
01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:30.970
<v Speaker 1>became convinced at that time that,</v>

2465
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that Lisa had for spares reasons that Lisa had been killed as part of a gang</v>

2466
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:35.840
<v Speaker 1>initiation ceremony.</v>

2467
01:10:35.841 --> 01:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2468
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.650
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2469
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to destroy these gangs,</v>

2470
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:39.950
<v Speaker 1>going to dedicate my life to destroying these gangs.</v>

2471
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:44.210
<v Speaker 1>She goes and applies to become a police officer and for years she's this,</v>

2472
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2473
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.210
<v Speaker 1>hardline cop,</v>

2474
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2475
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It takes real pleasure in busting people,</v>

2476
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>but least started to notice a few things.</v>

2477
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 1>First thing was,</v>

2478
01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2479
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 1>when you were a cop and you arrest a rapist,</v>

2480
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.590
<v Speaker 1>there are fewer rapes in your town the next week,</v>

2481
01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:01.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2482
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:02.130
<v Speaker 1>When you are copying,</v>

2483
01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you bust a pedophile,</v>

2484
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 1>fewer children get sexually abused,</v>

2485
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>but she knows when you bust a dealer,</v>

2486
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no fewer dealers.</v>

2487
01:11:09.681 --> 01:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>There's someone on the corner the next day for sure,</v>

2488
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2489
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem to be having any effect.</v>

2490
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.191
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2491
01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>what she discovered while she was,</v>

2492
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>she began to learn about this was that there was something,</v>

2493
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2494
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>even worse,</v>

2495
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:19.700
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

2496
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.533
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2497
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>if for any sort of reason that she realized that she was actually creating these</v>

2498
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>empowering these gangs.</v>

2499
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>So the best way to explain this is if you imagine,</v>

2500
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>obviously when you,</v>

2501
01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>when you ban drugs,</v>

2502
01:11:32.131 --> 01:11:32.964
<v Speaker 1>they don't disappear,</v>

2503
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:33.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2504
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>That transferred from the people who are used to control them,</v>

2505
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:39.030
<v Speaker 1>licensed legal businesses to armed criminal gangs,</v>

2506
01:11:39.031 --> 01:11:39.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2507
01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>And these aren't criminal gangs operate in a different way to,</v>

2508
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.100
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2509
01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:42.970
<v Speaker 1>to legal businesses.</v>

2510
01:11:42.971 --> 01:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>So if you imagine if you and me decided we want to go and steal now a bottle of</v>

2511
01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:46.980
<v Speaker 1>vodka,</v>

2512
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2513
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 1>We're going to local liquor store and that store catches us,</v>

2514
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 1>they'll call the cops.</v>

2515
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:53.460
<v Speaker 1>The cops will come and take us away.</v>

2516
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 1>That liquor store doesn't need to be violent.</v>

2517
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to be intimidating.</v>

2518
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.700
<v Speaker 1>They've got the power of the law to uphold their property rights.</v>

2519
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Can now imagine we were to steal a bag of coke,</v>

2520
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.173
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2521
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.310
<v Speaker 1>If we go to the guy near here,</v>

2522
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is someone who,</v>

2523
01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:05.900
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2524
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2525
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.523
<v Speaker 1>sells coke,</v>

2526
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:08.543
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2527
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 1>and he catches us.</v>

2528
01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.470
<v Speaker 1>He can't call the cops.</v>

2529
01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Obviously cops would arrest him.</v>

2530
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.380
<v Speaker 1>He has to fight us.</v>

2531
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.401
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're a dealer,</v>

2532
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be having a fight every day,</v>

2533
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:16.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2534
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>You want to establish a reputation for being so frightening that no one would</v>

2535
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:20.580
<v Speaker 1>dare to fuck with you,</v>

2536
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:21.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2537
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:21.441
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

2538
01:12:21.441 --> 01:12:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you establish your place in that neighborhood through aggression,</v>

2539
01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:24.480
<v Speaker 1>through violence,</v>

2540
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.490
<v Speaker 1>and you maintain it through aggression and violence,</v>

2541
01:12:26.491 --> 01:12:27.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2542
01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2543
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:32.270
<v Speaker 1>legal businesses compete on cost and quality of product in illegal markets.</v>

2544
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 1>People compete on how much of a frightening fucker you're prepared to be,</v>

2545
01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2546
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 1>And as a writer called Charles Bout and put it,</v>

2547
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs creates a war for drugs,</v>

2548
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2549
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 1>It transfers it to these criminal gangs who have to operate through violence to</v>

2550
01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:50.250
<v Speaker 1>protect their property rights.</v>

2551
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.460
<v Speaker 1>So link goes into the drug war thinking I'm the one stopping these gangs.</v>

2552
01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 1>She realizes she,</v>

2553
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one enabling them,</v>

2554
01:12:58.561 --> 01:12:59.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2555
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:02.910
<v Speaker 1>They control one of the biggest industries in the world because of this police</v>

2556
01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:03.240
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

2557
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And because of this decision to prohibit these drugs,</v>

2558
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to know how much of this violence is caused by,</v>

2559
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:10.141
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

2560
01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:10.974
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2561
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>by the fact that we prohibited it,</v>

2562
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 1>just ask yourself,</v>

2563
01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 1>where are the violent alcohol dealers,</v>

2564
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:16.583
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2565
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows who al Capone was.</v>

2566
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Does the head of Smirnoff go and shoot that had a Budweiser in the face?</v>

2567
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2568
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Does your local bar go and send a bunch of kids to go and shoot everyone in the</v>

2569
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:27.234
<v Speaker 1>next bar down?</v>

2570
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course not exactly that happened and the alcohol prohibition,</v>

2571
01:13:30.361 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 1>when did it end ended on the day alcohol prohibition ended because legal markets</v>

2572
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:36.263
<v Speaker 1>don't compete with that.</v>

2573
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.770
<v Speaker 1>So at least partly having this insight,</v>

2574
01:13:37.771 --> 01:13:37.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2575
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:38.814
<v Speaker 1>She's realizing,</v>

2576
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

2577
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm taking down these gangs.</v>

2578
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually empowering them.</v>

2579
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:45.570
<v Speaker 1>What will really disempowered them as reclaiming the market and making it legal.</v>

2580
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.780
<v Speaker 1>But she also has another really painful realization.</v>

2581
01:13:48.781 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>So early in her career as a cop,</v>

2582
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Lee had done this really brave thing.</v>

2583
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 1>She'd gone undercover with the clan to expose them.</v>

2584
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:58.830
<v Speaker 1>She'd done a really important work in breaking up parts of the Maryland clam.</v>

2585
01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 1>She really was not a racist,</v>

2586
01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:00.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2587
01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 1>She'd had relationships with African American men,</v>

2588
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but she knows something that most on is cops notice,</v>

2589
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:09.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the vast majority of people,</v>

2590
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2591
01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>they were sent to African areas to enforce</v>

2592
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:12.941
<v Speaker 4>the drug laws.</v>

2593
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:13.750
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2594
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:14.471
<v Speaker 4>One of our colleagues,</v>

2595
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:15.304
<v Speaker 4>Matthew fog,</v>

2596
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 4>once went to his superior officer and said,</v>

2597
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:19.354
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2598
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.741
<v Speaker 4>this is a bit weird,</v>

2599
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:21.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2600
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:24.160
<v Speaker 4>We only ever seem to go to African American neighborhoods to do all our drug</v>

2601
01:14:24.161 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 4>busts.</v>

2602
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:27.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm fairly sure white people sometimes use drug.</v>

2603
01:14:27.341 --> 01:14:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Should we go to like a white neighborhood as well?</v>

2604
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 4>And the supervisor said,</v>

2605
01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:31.384
<v Speaker 4>of course you're right.</v>

2606
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.590
<v Speaker 4>White people use drugs,</v>

2607
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:33.941
<v Speaker 4>but white people,</v>

2608
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:36.220
<v Speaker 4>no journalists and lawyers and judges.</v>

2609
01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:36.990
<v Speaker 4>That's really,</v>

2610
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 4>we that's just get a whole load of shit for us.</v>

2611
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Just go for the low hanging fruit.</v>

2612
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.370
<v Speaker 4>So Lee who is not a racist,</v>

2613
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.170
<v Speaker 4>could see the effect of what she was doing was in fact racist.</v>

2614
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:47.441
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2615
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.820
<v Speaker 4>And she was very uncomfortable with that.</v>

2616
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 4>And this really came to a head Billy when Lee's police partner was guy called</v>

2617
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:53.111
<v Speaker 4>Ed.</v>

2618
01:14:53.111 --> 01:14:53.621
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

2619
01:14:53.621 --> 01:14:54.730
<v Speaker 4>Who she loved.</v>

2620
01:14:54.731 --> 01:14:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Platonically loved.</v>

2621
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2622
01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:56.741
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2623
01:14:56.741 --> 01:14:58.690
<v Speaker 4>he was a great champion of women police officers.</v>

2624
01:14:58.691 --> 01:14:59.650
<v Speaker 4>It was a great guy.</v>

2625
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 4>And one day she gets a call at home.</v>

2626
01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Ed had been sent on a drug bust.</v>

2627
01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:05.510
<v Speaker 4>He was undercover and uh,</v>

2628
01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 4>the guy had thought it was ripping him off and shot him in the head.</v>

2629
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.640
<v Speaker 4>And lead goes to see eds body.</v>

2630
01:15:09.641 --> 01:15:10.474
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

2631
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.130
<v Speaker 4>what did he die for?</v>

2632
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.671
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2633
01:15:12.671 --> 01:15:14.230
<v Speaker 4>There are no fewer drug dealers.</v>

2634
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Every time we arrest the drug dealer,</v>

2635
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:19.240
<v Speaker 4>the supply of drugs is not disrupted for one hour.</v>

2636
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:22.210
<v Speaker 4>We are enforcing a racist war.</v>

2637
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:23.950
<v Speaker 4>We are empowering these gangs.</v>

2638
01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 4>Why are we doing this?</v>

2639
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 4>So Lee quit as a police officer,</v>

2640
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 4>she retrained as a lawyer.</v>

2641
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:32.500
<v Speaker 4>She now gets the criminal records expunged wherever she can have the kind of</v>

2642
01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:35.500
<v Speaker 4>people that she busted when she was a cop and she's a big,</v>

2643
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.410
<v Speaker 4>she was part of the brilliant group called law enforcement against prohibition</v>

2644
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:41.560
<v Speaker 4>who are cops who argue for ending the drug war.</v>

2645
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:46.750
<v Speaker 4>But it's interesting to me because it's hard to be Harry Lee was trying to be</v>

2646
01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Harry Anslinger is hard to be Harry Anslinger if you're an honest person with a</v>

2647
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:51.490
<v Speaker 4>conscience,</v>

2648
01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:52.323
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2649
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:55.270
<v Speaker 4>And there are police officers all over the country who are making these,</v>

2650
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:55.541
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2651
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 4>these realizations now and that,</v>

2652
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.703
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2653
01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 4>obviously it's very close to my heart,</v>

2654
01:16:03.581 --> 01:16:05.290
<v Speaker 4>what we do to people with addiction problems.</v>

2655
01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.513
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

2656
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 4>Horrific and catastrophic though.</v>

2657
01:16:09.101 --> 01:16:09.934
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

2658
01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't actually think that's the biggest moral issue around the war on drugs.</v>

2659
01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:17.020
<v Speaker 4>The biggest moral issue is the violence created by prohibition,</v>

2660
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:17.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2661
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 4>If I think about places I've spent time like Columbia,</v>

2662
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:20.640
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2663
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 4>see it at Horace in,</v>

2664
01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:23.320
<v Speaker 4>in northern Mexico,</v>

2665
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 4>that's the biggest issue,</v>

2666
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:24.881
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2667
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 4>More people have died in,</v>

2668
01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 4>in Latin America,</v>

2669
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 4>central and South America,</v>

2670
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:30.730
<v Speaker 4>in the drug war,</v>

2671
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:32.620
<v Speaker 4>violence than have died in Syria.</v>

2672
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:34.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what we can do about Syria.</v>

2673
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.330
<v Speaker 4>We can end this violence as professor at Harvard could.</v>

2674
01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:42.331
<v Speaker 4>Jeffrey Myron [inaudible] has a graph of the murder rate in the 20th century in</v>

2675
01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:44.524
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

2676
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.240
<v Speaker 4>massively shoots up the day.</v>

2677
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol is banned and fools like a stone.</v>

2678
01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:49.450
<v Speaker 4>The day alcohol is legalized,</v>

2679
01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:50.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2680
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 4>And massively rises again when there's an intensification of the drug war later,</v>

2681
01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:54.323
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2682
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.260
<v Speaker 4>we can end a huge amount of this violence,</v>

2683
01:16:56.261 --> 01:16:56.381
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2684
01:16:56.381 --> 01:16:57.400
<v Speaker 4>We can do what Switzerland did.</v>

2685
01:16:57.401 --> 01:16:58.860
<v Speaker 4>We can do what,</v>

2686
01:16:58.861 --> 01:17:00.490
<v Speaker 4>what's happening here and what's stopping us.</v>

2687
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.160
<v Speaker 4>So I think the main thing is this is a logical conclusion based on facts and</v>

2688
01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 4>based on cases like Portugal and Switzerland,</v>

2689
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 4>there's obviously data.</v>

2690
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 1>So people are aware of this.</v>

2691
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So people must be confronted with this data.</v>

2692
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.111
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

2693
01:17:15.111 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 1>people know that the prohibition on alcohol was a massive disaster and no one</v>

2694
01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:20.300
<v Speaker 1>would ever accept it again.</v>

2695
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>We're slowly starting to realize that marijuana,</v>

2696
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>at least for some people is,</v>

2697
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>is safe and reasonable and should be used recreationally and has some massive</v>

2698
01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:29.900
<v Speaker 1>benefits medically.</v>

2699
01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So we're starting to see legalization both for recreational use and,</v>

2700
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2701
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>clearly for medical uses spread.</v>

2702
01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2703
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.950
<v Speaker 1>what did we decide what it was?</v>

2704
01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2705
01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like there's a certain amount of states where it's just fully legal</v>

2706
01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>recreationally and more where it's medical,</v>

2707
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:51.330
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more than 18 states total knee.</v>

2708
01:17:51.331 --> 01:17:54.840
<v Speaker 1>As soon we're going to be half of the American population should be 100%.</v>

2709
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:55.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2710
01:17:55.461 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 1>we all is in Canada and it should be,</v>

2711
01:17:57.681 --> 01:18:00.440
<v Speaker 1>yes it is in Canada as it should be for alcohol.</v>

2712
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:01.603
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

2713
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.840
<v Speaker 1>what is the stop?</v>

2714
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:07.640
<v Speaker 1>What is the wall between this and legalization of all these other drugs and</v>

2715
01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 1>counseling and implementing some sort of a Switzerland like program?</v>

2716
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.730
<v Speaker 1>The think going to the really important question.</v>

2717
01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So there's a range of things.</v>

2718
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2719
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 1>this is a public perception.</v>

2720
01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:18.044
<v Speaker 1>A big one.</v>

2721
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you've gone to the most important,</v>

2722
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:19.521
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2723
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>So some people say it's the vested financial interest in the existing system.</v>

2724
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:23.623
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2725
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 1>If you look at who funds the no campaigns,</v>

2726
01:18:26.811 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>whenever they want to legalize marijuana,</v>

2727
01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>you can see the interest,</v>

2728
01:18:29.201 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2729
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Prison guard unions,</v>

2730
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2731
01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 1>alcohol companies cause they didn't want a commercial competitor.</v>

2732
01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2733
01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.730
<v Speaker 1>religious fundamentalist groups like Mormons,</v>

2734
01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>not the all Mormons fundamentalist,</v>

2735
01:18:39.111 --> 01:18:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but the grips that funding this are,</v>

2736
01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2737
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.190
<v Speaker 1>so it's partly that,</v>

2738
01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:44.024
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're right.</v>

2739
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the main thing that's going on.</v>

2740
01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:45.701
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2741
01:18:45.701 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it's significant and real,</v>

2742
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:48.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's the main thing that's going on.</v>

2743
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 1>The main thing,</v>

2744
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 1>the main block is</v>

2745
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.671
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>

2746
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Majority of Americans,</v>

2747
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 1>more than 80% said the war on drugs has failed and been a disaster.</v>

2748
01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And yet most people are afraid of the alternatives.</v>

2749
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2750
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's pot setting.</v>

2751
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:02.743
<v Speaker 1>There's two things going on.</v>

2752
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:05.390
<v Speaker 1>There's ignorance about what the alternatives actually mean.</v>

2753
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:09.950
<v Speaker 1>So re one of the reasons why chasing sqream is written as I went to all these</v>

2754
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:14.480
<v Speaker 1>places from the killing fields in northern Mexico to Switzerland is because way</v>

2755
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:18.260
<v Speaker 1>too often in this debate we talk like we're a philosophy seminar.</v>

2756
01:19:18.261 --> 01:19:18.830
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>

2757
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 1>or what would legalization mean?</v>

2758
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.201
<v Speaker 1>How would it work?</v>

2759
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:24.680
<v Speaker 1>And they go into this weird abstract conversation like fuck that.</v>

2760
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Here's a plane ticket to Geneva,</v>

2761
01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 1>here's a plane ticket to Lisbon is a plane ticket to Colorado,</v>

2762
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2763
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not rocket science.</v>

2764
01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2765
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the places that have tried these things.</v>

2766
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.150
<v Speaker 1>We can see the results,</v>

2767
01:19:35.151 --> 01:19:35.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2768
01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Then they're not legalization is not an APP or decrement decriminalization.</v>

2769
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I explain the difference if you want are not abstract.</v>

2770
01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 1>What's the key differences between legalization and decriminalization?</v>

2771
01:19:45.351 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Decriminalization is where you stop punishing users,</v>

2772
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:50.990
<v Speaker 1>but they still have to go to armed criminal gangs to get their drug.</v>

2773
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Legalization is where you open up some legal route for people to get their</v>

2774
01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:55.131
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

2775
01:19:55.131 --> 01:19:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's varies according to the drug,</v>

2776
01:19:57.021 --> 01:19:57.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2777
01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the kind of headline would be decriminalization shuts down.</v>

2778
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Orange is the new black and legalization shuts down breaking bad and Naacos</v>

2779
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:04.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2780
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.421
<v Speaker 1>And of course we need to do,</v>

2781
01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>but you're throwing to decriminalize use and legalize supply.</v>

2782
01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:11.340
<v Speaker 4>Mexico decriminalize a lot of drugs like fairly recently.</v>

2783
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2784
01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 4>That a big supreme court decision aspect.</v>

2785
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:16.190
<v Speaker 4>A lot of time in Mexico.</v>

2786
01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:18.780
<v Speaker 4>And I think about,</v>

2787
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 4>I think about this time I spent in Mexico really often</v>

2788
01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.013
<v Speaker 4>because it was,</v>

2789
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to cover it.</v>

2790
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2791
01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2792
01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.590
<v Speaker 4>I've been to a lot of bad places.</v>

2793
01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 4>I covered the war in the Congo.</v>

2794
01:20:29.911 --> 01:20:30.870
<v Speaker 4>I've been to Iraq,</v>

2795
01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:31.704
<v Speaker 4>I've been to Gaza.</v>

2796
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.130
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything like what happened to horrors when,</v>

2797
01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:35.023
<v Speaker 4>when I was there,</v>

2798
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.233
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2799
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2800
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.090
<v Speaker 4>I think it's worth explaining.</v>

2801
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:41.460
<v Speaker 4>So when you,</v>

2802
01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:43.761
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying,</v>

2803
01:20:43.761 --> 01:20:45.710
<v Speaker 4>when you ban drugs that it disappear,</v>

2804
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:46.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2805
01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.630
<v Speaker 4>The transfer to armed criminal gangs.</v>

2806
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.960
<v Speaker 4>If you live in a housing project in the United States where 5% of the economy at</v>

2807
01:20:53.091 --> 01:20:54.980
<v Speaker 4>that housing project is in the hands of armed criminal gangs,</v>

2808
01:20:54.981 --> 01:20:55.701
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be a shitty,</v>

2809
01:20:55.701 --> 01:20:58.210
<v Speaker 4>frightening place to be right place.</v>

2810
01:20:58.211 --> 01:20:59.180
<v Speaker 4>I see it at Horace,</v>

2811
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2812
01:20:59.570 --> 01:21:03.290
<v Speaker 4>which is on the border with Mexican side of the United States border with them.</v>

2813
01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.690
<v Speaker 4>It's the other side with our Paso.</v>

2814
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:07.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2815
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:08.240
<v Speaker 4>by the time I went there,</v>

2816
01:21:08.241 --> 01:21:09.380
<v Speaker 4>it was 70%,</v>

2817
01:21:09.381 --> 01:21:12.350
<v Speaker 4>seven 0% of the economy was in the hands of these armed criminal gangs.</v>

2818
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2819
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:14.600
<v Speaker 4>So I remember</v>

2820
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:16.971
<v Speaker 4>going to see this guy,</v>

2821
01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Ross Saleo Retta,</v>

2822
01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:18.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2823
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.210
<v Speaker 4>interview people about him and horrors.</v>

2824
01:21:20.211 --> 01:21:20.691
<v Speaker 4>But then I went to,</v>

2825
01:21:20.691 --> 01:21:25.691
<v Speaker 4>he's in prison in the United States is in Tyler County and Rosalia it's</v>

2826
01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:26.510
<v Speaker 4>interesting guys.</v>

2827
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:31.510
<v Speaker 4>He butchered or beheaded about 70 people between the ages of 13 and 17 to,</v>

2828
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2829
01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm going into the prison actually to see him.</v>

2830
01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:35.840
<v Speaker 4>And the guard said to me on the way in,</v>

2831
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:38.680
<v Speaker 4>but obviously I can't leave you alone with him cause he's like,</v>

2832
01:21:38.681 --> 01:21:38.991
<v Speaker 4>but shit,</v>

2833
01:21:38.991 --> 01:21:39.531
<v Speaker 4>all these people,</v>

2834
01:21:39.531 --> 01:21:39.861
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2835
01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:40.281
<v Speaker 4>oh great,</v>

2836
01:21:40.281 --> 01:21:41.114
<v Speaker 4>thanks.</v>

2837
01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.820
<v Speaker 4>And we have about five minutes until around the guard was fucking God.</v>

2838
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:48.170
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just saying we've Rosario talking about his life and his,</v>

2839
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.373
<v Speaker 4>his story.</v>

2840
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:51.620
<v Speaker 4>So Rozalia grew up in Laredo,</v>

2841
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:53.301
<v Speaker 4>Texas side of the border.</v>

2842
01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:55.090
<v Speaker 4>It's basically the same places.</v>

2843
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:56.210
<v Speaker 4>Nuevo Laredo on the,</v>

2844
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:57.260
<v Speaker 4>on the Mexican side.</v>

2845
01:21:57.261 --> 01:21:58.970
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty easy to cross the border at that time.</v>

2846
01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Secret he was growing up in the late nineties.</v>

2847
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Noughties remember Sally,</v>

2848
01:22:04.161 --> 01:22:05.630
<v Speaker 4>I was 13 so loads get,</v>

2849
01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:07.850
<v Speaker 4>the designers were kind of famous drug gang at that time.</v>

2850
01:22:07.851 --> 01:22:09.950
<v Speaker 4>They still are a good drug cartel.</v>

2851
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:11.240
<v Speaker 4>How does Etas were created?</v>

2852
01:22:11.241 --> 01:22:12.080
<v Speaker 4>It's an insane story.</v>

2853
01:22:12.081 --> 01:22:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Every tax payer should know.</v>

2854
01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:18.260
<v Speaker 4>The US government decided to train and elite anti drug force for the,</v>

2855
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:19.310
<v Speaker 4>for the Mexican government,</v>

2856
01:22:19.311 --> 01:22:19.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2857
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Like kind of navy seals for the anti-drug force or they take them to Fort Bragg.</v>

2858
01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.670
<v Speaker 4>They spent something like $250 million training them up.</v>

2859
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:26.810
<v Speaker 4>They go back to Mexico.</v>

2860
01:22:26.811 --> 01:22:29.180
<v Speaker 4>Six months later they all defected on mass.</v>

2861
01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.133
<v Speaker 4>Almost all of them.</v>

2862
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:31.430
<v Speaker 4>I created a drug cartel.</v>

2863
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.150
<v Speaker 4>There's Zetas,</v>

2864
01:22:32.150 --> 01:22:32.391
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

2865
01:22:32.391 --> 01:22:33.224
<v Speaker 4>Use your tax money.</v>

2866
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2867
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:38.060
<v Speaker 4>so the status where this kind of a glamorous in inverted commas,</v>

2868
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:42.680
<v Speaker 4>drug gang operating on that part of the border drug routes move around according</v>

2869
01:22:42.681 --> 01:22:43.461
<v Speaker 4>to where they put policing.</v>

2870
01:22:43.461 --> 01:22:44.330
<v Speaker 4>It always gets through,</v>

2871
01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:45.290
<v Speaker 4>but it moves around,</v>

2872
01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:46.310
<v Speaker 4>they call it the balloon effect.</v>

2873
01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Imagine a balloon half full of a push down,</v>

2874
01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:48.940
<v Speaker 4>one pace,</v>

2875
01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.030
<v Speaker 4>the air comes up somewhere else.</v>

2876
01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.340
<v Speaker 4>But at that time it was going through uh,</v>

2877
01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.270
<v Speaker 4>acquirers and our Paso and Laredo,</v>

2878
01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:57.890
<v Speaker 4>Nuevo Laredo and Russell.</v>

2879
01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:01.820
<v Speaker 4>Leo says to stories about how raw Saleo gets involved with the Zetas.</v>

2880
01:23:01.821 --> 01:23:02.840
<v Speaker 4>What Russell Leo says,</v>

2881
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:04.070
<v Speaker 4>he was basically kidnapped by them,</v>

2882
01:23:04.071 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 4>are forced to start people.</v>

2883
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:07.781
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>

2884
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:08.561
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the evidence,</v>

2885
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:10.720
<v Speaker 4>it's that he sort of volunteered base 13,</v>

2886
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 4>so I don't hold him morally responsible for that.</v>

2887
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 4>But either way,</v>

2888
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 4>there's one night it all begins.</v>

2889
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 4>He's taken on the Mexican side of the border to a warehouse where they are</v>

2890
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 4>torturing people,</v>

2891
01:23:22.511 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 4>burning them alive.</v>

2892
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.560
<v Speaker 4>He's given a gun by guy called Miguel Trevino,</v>

2893
01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 4>who later became the head of the Zetas and he's told to shoot someone in the</v>

2894
01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:29.891
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

2895
01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:30.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's the moment you're in.</v>

2896
01:23:30.971 --> 01:23:32.140
<v Speaker 4>And when you're in with the Zetas,</v>

2897
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:32.974
<v Speaker 4>you'd never get out,</v>

2898
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.400
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2899
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.420
<v Speaker 4>No one leaves.</v>

2900
01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2901
01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:36.550
<v Speaker 4>no one leaves alive.</v>

2902
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 4>And so they begin to train him.</v>

2903
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 4>He sent to us in 2005 he sent to a summer camp that's literally account for the</v>

2904
01:23:43.421 --> 01:23:43.691
<v Speaker 4>teachers.</v>

2905
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:48.691
<v Speaker 4>You had to behead people and do all sorts of things and he's then sent him in in</v>

2906
01:23:49.411 --> 01:23:51.930
<v Speaker 4>his friends are then sent to um,</v>

2907
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 4>murder people is with friends,</v>

2908
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 4>Jessie and Gabriel,</v>

2909
01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 4>they murder huge numbers that they were called within the Zetas called these</v>

2910
01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:00.880
<v Speaker 4>child soldiers the expendables,</v>

2911
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.740
<v Speaker 4>cause they don't give a shit if they live or die.</v>

2912
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2913
01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2914
01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:03.921
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2915
01:24:03.921 --> 01:24:04.750
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2916
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 4>this one person said to me,</v>

2917
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 4>they prefer children because they don't understand death so well.</v>

2918
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:08.441
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2919
01:24:08.441 --> 01:24:09.241
<v Speaker 4>Obviously is for solid,</v>

2920
01:24:09.241 --> 01:24:10.074
<v Speaker 4>got a bit older.</v>

2921
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:11.320
<v Speaker 4>He understood death better.</v>

2922
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.940
<v Speaker 4>All his friends get murdered,</v>

2923
01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 4>eventually tries to get back to the u s he cooperates.</v>

2924
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:18.190
<v Speaker 4>He now lives in solitary confinement where he will live by the rest of his life</v>

2925
01:24:18.191 --> 01:24:19.540
<v Speaker 4>because when they let him out of solitary,</v>

2926
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 4>shortly before I met him,</v>

2927
01:24:20.591 --> 01:24:23.200
<v Speaker 4>he was immediately stabbed in the neck.</v>

2928
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:24.423
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2929
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:26.201
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2930
01:24:26.201 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 4>you think about this insane violence that we created,</v>

2931
01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:30.281
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2932
01:24:30.281 --> 01:24:30.920
<v Speaker 4>When I went to Hawaii,</v>

2933
01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.050
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2934
01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 4>it's this bizarre thing.</v>

2935
01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:33.520
<v Speaker 4>So that time it wasn't,</v>

2936
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.320
<v Speaker 4>you were told it wasn't quite rightly,</v>

2937
01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:36.970
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't safe to stay in horror as overnight.</v>

2938
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.940
<v Speaker 4>So I would stay overnight in El Paso and I'd walk across the bridge right</v>

2939
01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 4>through three through share passport,</v>

2940
01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.290
<v Speaker 4>remember the customs people going,</v>

2941
01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:45.580
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you going into horrors,</v>

2942
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:46.730
<v Speaker 4>but go,</v>

2943
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.740
<v Speaker 4>go in there.</v>

2944
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:48.761
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2945
01:24:48.761 --> 01:24:51.430
<v Speaker 4>On on the other side of the bridge,</v>

2946
01:24:51.431 --> 01:24:54.820
<v Speaker 4>there's this sign and it says welcome to historic downtown Juarez.</v>

2947
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.290
<v Speaker 4>And it used to be a tourist site.</v>

2948
01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Billie holiday got married there.</v>

2949
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:58.503
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2950
01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 4>now it's just that time it was just covered with images of missing women,</v>

2951
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 4>just everywhere.</v>

2952
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:08.710
<v Speaker 4>Because this is another really important part of what this violence doesn't</v>

2953
01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:08.831
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

2954
01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 4>It's really important.</v>

2955
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 4>We understand this is the violence caused by the system that we uphold and we</v>

2956
01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:15.220
<v Speaker 4>imposed on Mexico.</v>

2957
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:16.540
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans do not want this.</v>

2958
01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2959
01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:18.040
<v Speaker 4>So there's another story.</v>

2960
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:20.650
<v Speaker 4>I think there's just of all the stories I wrote about for chasing the scream</v>

2961
01:25:20.651 --> 01:25:22.420
<v Speaker 4>along with one other one I can tell you about if you want.</v>

2962
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:23.860
<v Speaker 4>This was the hardest.</v>

2963
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.150
<v Speaker 4>So women in horrors.</v>

2964
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2965
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:32.170
<v Speaker 4>when the drug war violence starts to go through called Maricella Escobedo she</v>

2966
01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:32.530
<v Speaker 4>was a,</v>

2967
01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 4>a nurse,</v>

2968
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.600
<v Speaker 4>but Marissa was incredibly hardworking.</v>

2969
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:37.450
<v Speaker 4>So she also would do these,</v>

2970
01:25:37.451 --> 01:25:37.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2971
01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:39.760
<v Speaker 4>I would call it like woodcarvings basically,</v>

2972
01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:41.980
<v Speaker 4>and she would sell them in the market on Saturdays and Sundays.</v>

2973
01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.600
<v Speaker 4>She had three kids.</v>

2974
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 4>Our youngest daughter was called Ruby.</v>

2975
01:25:45.311 --> 01:25:49.060
<v Speaker 4>She was 14 at the time and they would work on this stall in the marketplace.</v>

2976
01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:49.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2977
01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.700
<v Speaker 4>every Saturday I think they'd been Sundays as well,</v>

2978
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:52.893
<v Speaker 4>some Sundays.</v>

2979
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:58.360
<v Speaker 4>And one day a guy comes up to my reseller that has store called Sergio.</v>

2980
01:25:58.810 --> 01:25:59.471
<v Speaker 4>He was young guy,</v>

2981
01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:00.370
<v Speaker 4>he was like 21.</v>

2982
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2983
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:02.201
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

2986
01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Marcella was kind of soft hearted.</v>

2987
01:26:05.241 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 4>She gives him a job working on her market stall.</v>

2988
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.250
<v Speaker 4>And a few months later she discovers to her horror that he's having sex with a</v>

2989
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:13.971
<v Speaker 4>14 year old daughter,</v>

2990
01:26:13.971 --> 01:26:14.301
<v Speaker 4>Ruby.</v>

2991
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:14.960
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

2992
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.630
<v Speaker 4>fires him immediately and it goes to the police and says,</v>

2993
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 4>you need to go and question him.</v>

2994
01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.131
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2995
01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:19.731
<v Speaker 4>He's 21,</v>

2996
01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:20.331
<v Speaker 4>she's 14.</v>

2997
01:26:20.331 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 4>This is a crime.</v>

2998
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:22.760
<v Speaker 4>Police don't do anything.</v>

2999
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't understand it.</v>

3000
01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:24.590
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3001
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 4>why are they not investigating this?</v>

3002
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Her daughter starts running away to be with w with Sergio.</v>

3003
01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.013
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3004
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Maricella keeps going to get her back.</v>

3005
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 4>She keeps going to the police saying this is a crime.</v>

3006
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Can't live with a 14 year old go and arrest of they won't do anything.</v>

3007
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:38.941
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3008
01:26:38.941 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 4>She completely puzzled by this.</v>

3009
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Then Ruby gets pregnant.</v>

3010
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Marcel is like fishes 15 by then it's like fuck,</v>

3011
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I've got to keep her in my life.</v>

3012
01:26:45.441 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 4>So she,</v>

3013
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 4>she keeps going to see ruby.</v>

3014
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 4>By this time she's kind of accepted the police on with real rage that police</v>

3015
01:26:51.951 --> 01:26:52.870
<v Speaker 4>aren't going to do anything.</v>

3016
01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.220
<v Speaker 4>And then one day just after the baby was born,</v>

3017
01:26:55.221 --> 01:26:59.180
<v Speaker 4>she goes to see Ruby and Sergio's there with the baby and he says,</v>

3018
01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:02.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm a ruby has run away with another man.</v>

3019
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:02.780
<v Speaker 4>She's gone.</v>

3020
01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:04.040
<v Speaker 4>She's not coming back.</v>

3021
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.350
<v Speaker 4>And varicella is like what?</v>

3022
01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 4>And left her baby.</v>

3023
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:07.911
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3024
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:08.481
<v Speaker 4>she hasn't done.</v>

3025
01:27:08.481 --> 01:27:09.261
<v Speaker 4>I know she hasn't done that.</v>

3026
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3027
01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 4>My daughter,</v>

3028
01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:10.401
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3029
01:27:10.401 --> 01:27:11.360
<v Speaker 4>well she's gone.</v>

3030
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 4>So Mary's cell awaits.</v>

3031
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Christmas comes,</v>

3032
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:14.541
<v Speaker 4>no message.</v>

3033
01:27:14.541 --> 01:27:15.141
<v Speaker 4>New Year comes,</v>

3034
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:15.974
<v Speaker 4>no message.</v>

3035
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:20.690
<v Speaker 4>She starts to go to the neighborhood and hand out leaflets with pictures of our</v>

3036
01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 4>daughter.</v>

3037
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Loads of women are going missing.</v>

3038
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:23.360
<v Speaker 4>And Horace at this time I,</v>

3039
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:24.194
<v Speaker 4>Taiwan minute,</v>

3040
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:25.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying,</v>

3041
01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:26.630
<v Speaker 4>have you seen this go.</v>

3042
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 4>And after a few days she gets a call from a kid called an hale who says,</v>

3043
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:32.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm really frightened to tell you something.</v>

3044
01:27:32.841 --> 01:27:34.010
<v Speaker 4>If you drive me out into the desert,</v>

3045
01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:34.844
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you.</v>

3046
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:36.590
<v Speaker 4>So she drives an hell out into the desert.</v>

3047
01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.730
<v Speaker 4>He was 14.</v>

3048
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:38.993
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3049
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:39.883
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>

3050
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:40.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3051
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 4>Sergio murdered your daughter.</v>

3052
01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:44.180
<v Speaker 4>And he made me help him dispose of the body.</v>

3053
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.280
<v Speaker 4>And he told Maricella where the body was.</v>

3054
01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.270
<v Speaker 4>It was actually a place where they dumped a pig carcasses from the AB 12.</v>

3055
01:27:50.271 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 4>She goes and she finds the body with a son</v>

3056
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:57.290
<v Speaker 4>and she goes to the police and the police finally do something and they arrest</v>

3057
01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:58.124
<v Speaker 4>Sergio.</v>

3058
01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Sergio's put on trial in the witness box.</v>

3059
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:01.880
<v Speaker 4>He breaks down,</v>

3060
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:05.000
<v Speaker 4>admits he did it and apologizes to Maricella.</v>

3061
01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:10.100
<v Speaker 4>And then a few weeks later he's acquitted of all charges and disappears.</v>

3062
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:11.421
<v Speaker 4>And Marisol is like,</v>

3063
01:28:11.421 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

3064
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.890
<v Speaker 4>So she starts to look into this and she discovers,</v>

3065
01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:19.160
<v Speaker 4>and this is the work intersects with the drug war and a really important way</v>

3066
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:22.070
<v Speaker 4>that the Sergio was a member of the Zetas.</v>

3067
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>

3068
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:26.630
<v Speaker 4>if you remember the Zetas at that time in horror as his different acts and other</v>

3069
01:28:26.631 --> 01:28:27.830
<v Speaker 4>drug gangs displaced them,</v>

3070
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:30.020
<v Speaker 4>you own the state,</v>

3071
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:30.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3072
01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.713
<v Speaker 4>And you have,</v>

3073
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 4>if they control 70% of the economy,</v>

3074
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:35.630
<v Speaker 4>you have more money than the government.</v>

3075
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3076
01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.040
<v Speaker 4>So the police work.</v>

3077
01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.270
<v Speaker 4>Then when I went to go into be Rozalia,</v>

3078
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:39.890
<v Speaker 4>he said when I would go mare to people,</v>

3079
01:28:39.891 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 4>the police would,</v>

3080
01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:41.503
<v Speaker 4>would come with me.</v>

3081
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.650
<v Speaker 4>They would dispose of the body.</v>

3082
01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3083
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Remember to great.</v>

3084
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:45.740
<v Speaker 4>And what year are we talking about?</v>

3085
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:46.910
<v Speaker 4>This is like six years ago.</v>

3086
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:47.781
<v Speaker 4>I remember the,</v>

3087
01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:48.031
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3088
01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3089
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.930
<v Speaker 4>the tea.</v>

3090
01:28:48.930 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bit,</v>

3091
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:49.931
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3092
01:28:49.931 --> 01:28:51.650
<v Speaker 4>Because one of the things when you're in a dangerous place,</v>

3093
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:52.230
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

3094
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:53.210
<v Speaker 4>when you're in a dangerous place,</v>

3095
01:28:53.211 --> 01:28:56.600
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you do is you read danger from how frightened the people</v>

3096
01:28:56.601 --> 01:28:57.350
<v Speaker 4>around you are.</v>

3097
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.651
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3098
01:28:57.651 --> 01:28:59.390
<v Speaker 4>Because you don't know the place I was.</v>

3099
01:28:59.391 --> 01:28:59.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3100
01:28:59.601 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I was there with Julio and Cardona is my fixer.</v>

3101
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:02.694
<v Speaker 4>He's an amazing,</v>

3102
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.760
<v Speaker 4>he's the Reuters corresponded choir is one of the bravest people I've ever met.</v>

3103
01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.120
<v Speaker 4>But it was realizing how frightened other people were for me and Julio on,</v>

3104
01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3105
01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:14.250
<v Speaker 4>And I remember after I'd been there for a few days,</v>

3106
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:17.830
<v Speaker 4>helion kept introducing me.</v>

3107
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.221
<v Speaker 4>By that time,</v>

3108
01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:22.280
<v Speaker 4>the killings were basically all being done by the police and it was saying,</v>

3109
01:29:22.281 --> 01:29:22.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3110
01:29:22.431 --> 01:29:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Julio,</v>

3111
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:23.513
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3112
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:26.420
<v Speaker 4>this is important that I meet people who've been killed by the police,</v>

3113
01:29:26.421 --> 01:29:28.970
<v Speaker 4>but I should also meet people who've been killed by the cartels more recently.</v>

3114
01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.500
<v Speaker 4>And he said that he just laughed and said,</v>

3115
01:29:30.501 --> 01:29:30.611
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3116
01:29:30.611 --> 01:29:30.810
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3117
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:31.631
<v Speaker 4>that's not how it works here.</v>

3118
01:29:31.631 --> 01:29:33.680
<v Speaker 4>I had now if the cartels want to kill someone,</v>

3119
01:29:33.681 --> 01:29:34.730
<v Speaker 4>they just pay the police to do it,</v>

3120
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:35.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3121
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:36.740
<v Speaker 4>So it's this real realization,</v>

3122
01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.330
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3123
01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:38.151
<v Speaker 4>if someone comes to you,</v>

3124
01:29:38.151 --> 01:29:39.680
<v Speaker 4>there is nowhere for you to go,</v>

3125
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:40.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3126
01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:44.990
<v Speaker 4>So Mary refuses to accept that she lives in a country where there is no justice.</v>

3127
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:46.070
<v Speaker 4>She decides,</v>

3128
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.730
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3129
01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:47.750
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to solve this.</v>

3130
01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:49.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to solve this.</v>

3131
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:50.260
<v Speaker 4>She appealed.</v>

3132
01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Look at loads of women are missing because it turns out if a bunch of criminals</v>

3133
01:29:53.841 --> 01:29:54.620
<v Speaker 4>control the state,</v>

3134
01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.270
<v Speaker 4>they will just murder loads of women and get away with it,</v>

3135
01:29:56.271 --> 01:29:56.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3136
01:29:56.690 --> 01:29:58.220
<v Speaker 4>There are some men who just want to murder women,</v>

3137
01:29:58.221 --> 01:29:59.390
<v Speaker 4>and if they give them license to do it,</v>

3138
01:29:59.391 --> 01:29:59.990
<v Speaker 4>they'll do it.</v>

3139
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:01.550
<v Speaker 4>That's why so many women we're missing.</v>

3140
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Maricella gathers a load of those mothers.</v>

3141
01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.371
<v Speaker 4>She says,</v>

3142
01:30:04.371 --> 01:30:05.630
<v Speaker 4>some of them don't know where their daughters are.</v>

3143
01:30:05.631 --> 01:30:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Some of them know their daughters are dead.</v>

3144
01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:07.520
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

3145
01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.353
<v Speaker 4>I need your help.</v>

3146
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:11.780
<v Speaker 4>We're going to find this guy who's done this right?</v>

3147
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:16.760
<v Speaker 4>So Maricella turns herself with these women into a detective.</v>

3148
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.240
<v Speaker 4>She starts tracking Sergio all over Mexico,</v>

3149
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:21.590
<v Speaker 4>wherever there are sightings,</v>

3150
01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.420
<v Speaker 4>she walks everywhere.</v>

3151
01:30:23.421 --> 01:30:25.070
<v Speaker 4>She walks over a thousand miles,</v>

3152
01:30:25.071 --> 01:30:25.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3153
01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:26.600
<v Speaker 4>She walks through the desert.</v>

3154
01:30:26.601 --> 01:30:27.770
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a media phenomenon.</v>

3155
01:30:27.771 --> 01:30:28.670
<v Speaker 4>People follow her.</v>

3156
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.710
<v Speaker 4>She's like this,</v>

3157
01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:34.070
<v Speaker 4>this symbol of the loss that's happened in Mexico and incredibly with a friend,</v>

3158
01:30:34.071 --> 01:30:34.371
<v Speaker 4>Berta,</v>

3159
01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:35.061
<v Speaker 4>Alysia Garcia,</v>

3160
01:30:35.061 --> 01:30:36.080
<v Speaker 4>who I got to know later,</v>

3161
01:30:36.710 --> 01:30:37.640
<v Speaker 4>after two years,</v>

3162
01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:39.110
<v Speaker 4>she finds Sergio.</v>

3163
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:40.490
<v Speaker 4>She tracks him down.</v>

3164
01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.170
<v Speaker 4>She goes to the police,</v>

3165
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:43.550
<v Speaker 4>she tells them where he is,</v>

3166
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:45.890
<v Speaker 4>they tip him off and he disappears.</v>

3167
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.751
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3168
01:30:46.751 --> 01:30:47.600
<v Speaker 4>she's devastated.</v>

3169
01:30:47.601 --> 01:30:50.300
<v Speaker 4>So she decided she's going to go to the governor's mansion in Chihuahua,</v>

3170
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:51.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3171
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:52.370
<v Speaker 4>which the state capitol.</v>

3172
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:58.330
<v Speaker 4>She goes there and she sets up 10 outside the governor's mansion and she's like,</v>

3173
01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not leaving here until you people go and find this man.</v>

3174
01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:07.900
<v Speaker 4>And she calls on every mother who has a daughter who's missing or they're afraid</v>

3175
01:31:07.941 --> 01:31:11.090
<v Speaker 4>of four to come and join her in this fight.</v>

3176
01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.013
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3177
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:16.760
<v Speaker 4>And it gets to Christmas Eve and she's preparing to it just before Christmas</v>

3178
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:17.541
<v Speaker 4>isn't Christmas Eve.</v>

3179
01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have this big Christmas dinner here.</v>

3180
01:31:18.861 --> 01:31:19.790
<v Speaker 4>People can join me.</v>

3181
01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:23.360
<v Speaker 4>She gives this great speech and a man walks up,</v>

3182
01:31:23.361 --> 01:31:25.760
<v Speaker 4>turn sheets are in the head in front of all the police,</v>

3183
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.633
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>

3184
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.733
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

3185
01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:32.870
<v Speaker 4>to a lot about Maricella.</v>

3186
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:35.680
<v Speaker 4>I got to know her children who live here in the United States now they've got</v>

3187
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:37.680
<v Speaker 5>a refugee.</v>

3188
01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.560
<v Speaker 4>When I think about the drug war and what it does,</v>

3189
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:43.000
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3190
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.630
<v Speaker 4>the first person I think I've after Billie holiday's Marisella Escobedo right.</v>

3191
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:51.370
<v Speaker 4>We have created an enormous amount of violence that has nothing to do with the</v>

3192
01:31:51.371 --> 01:31:51.641
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>

3193
01:31:51.641 --> 01:31:52.474
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3194
01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Often people will hear this phrase,</v>

3195
01:31:53.681 --> 01:31:58.210
<v Speaker 4>drug related violence and what they picture when they hear that is someone using</v>

3196
01:31:58.211 --> 01:31:58.661
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

3197
01:31:58.661 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 4>losing shit and attacking someone.</v>

3198
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3199
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a really good study by a guy called professor Paul Goldstein that looked</v>

3200
01:32:03.761 --> 01:32:04.331
<v Speaker 1>at everything.</v>

3201
01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It was classified as drug related violence in New York City in 1986 what it</v>

3202
01:32:08.561 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 1>found was 3% of what's called drug related violence is someone using drugs and</v>

3203
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:12.971
<v Speaker 1>losing their shit.</v>

3204
01:32:12.971 --> 01:32:13.361
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

3205
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:18.361
<v Speaker 1>It happens sometimes 2% 3% another 7% was people with an addiction problem like</v>

3206
01:32:19.811 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>committing property crimes and getting caught or whatever,</v>

3207
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and the vast majority was rival drug gangs and exactly the kind of violence</v>

3208
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:29.350
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>

3209
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 1>the war for drugs created by prohibition.</v>

3210
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Now we can reduce the problems associated with drug use by having,</v>

3211
01:32:35.561 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>these are just,</v>

3212
01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 1>they have in Switzerland to Portugal and we can end the violence caused by the</v>

3213
01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:40.331
<v Speaker 1>war for drugs.</v>

3214
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 1>There are no violent alcohol gangs.</v>

3215
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Al Capone killed loads of people,</v>

3216
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.071
<v Speaker 1>drug,</v>

3217
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:48.700
<v Speaker 1>no alcohol seller anywhere in the United States today will kill a single other</v>

3218
01:32:48.701 --> 01:32:49.361
<v Speaker 1>alcohols seller,</v>

3219
01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:49.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3220
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That violence ended.</v>

3221
01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.360
<v Speaker 1>If we banned rice,</v>

3222
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 1>there will be violent rice sellers,</v>

3223
01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:54.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3224
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:58.560
<v Speaker 1>We have to understand that what we are doing,</v>

3225
01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.950
<v Speaker 1>and there's this bullshit fucking thing that said where they'll take these debts</v>

3226
01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:03.790
<v Speaker 1>on the supply route,</v>

3227
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3228
01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Prohibitionists and they'll say,</v>

3229
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:07.061
<v Speaker 1>look at you,</v>

3230
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 1>evil drug users,</v>

3231
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:11.050
<v Speaker 1>your responsible for the deaths of these people.</v>

3232
01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3233
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And to me that is so punishes,</v>

3234
01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:14.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3235
01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 1>You could have every single drug piece of druggies that happened in the United</v>

3236
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 1>States today and none of those killings on the supply route.</v>

3237
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 1>It is the system those people have erected and imposed and lied their way to</v>

3238
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:27.280
<v Speaker 1>maintain the causes,</v>

3239
01:33:27.281 --> 01:33:28.031
<v Speaker 1>this violence.</v>

3240
01:33:28.031 --> 01:33:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3241
01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 1>And we can end this violence.</v>

3242
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think about the Rosario,</v>

3243
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:33.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3244
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:33.270
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

3245
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.670
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3246
01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:34.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3247
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:35.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3248
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I got asked once in an interview,</v>

3249
01:33:36.521 --> 01:33:37.600
<v Speaker 1>who do you feel most sorry for?</v>

3250
01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Of all the people you met.</v>

3251
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And obviously I met people with addiction problems all over the world,</v>

3252
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3253
01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.550
<v Speaker 1>And I surprised myself,</v>

3254
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:45.970
<v Speaker 1>the person who came into my head was Rozalia because</v>

3255
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 1>we'll have we done to these people.</v>

3256
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3257
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not we for sure.</v>

3258
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3259
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:53.950
<v Speaker 1>As taxpayers we are responsible for it.</v>

3260
01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:54.131
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3261
01:33:54.131 --> 01:33:54.964
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't,</v>

3262
01:33:55.410 --> 01:33:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3263
01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you and I do not support it,</v>

3264
01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:58.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3265
01:33:58.170 --> 01:33:59.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3266
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.030
<v Speaker 1>as a society we,</v>

3267
01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:04.210
<v Speaker 1>we've done that and those of us who were pose it haven't done a good enough job</v>

3268
01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:04.620
<v Speaker 1>of persuading.</v>

3269
01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:05.050
<v Speaker 1>When else,</v>

3270
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and it goes back to your question,</v>

3271
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:06.791
<v Speaker 1>why does it persist?</v>

3272
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.624
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3273
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.980
<v Speaker 1>The key reason I think it's two things.</v>

3274
01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Partly people are afraid of the alternatives for understandable reasons.</v>

3275
01:34:15.041 --> 01:34:17.230
<v Speaker 1>There are real risks in pursuing the alternatives.</v>

3276
01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3277
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I think we can understand what those were signed deal with them,</v>

3278
01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:20.831
<v Speaker 1>but that bounce that,</v>

3279
01:34:20.831 --> 01:34:24.490
<v Speaker 1>hold on because it seems like those risks have been mitigated in Portugal and</v>

3280
01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

3281
01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have real evidence that those risks and there are unfounded.</v>

3282
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3283
01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You can understand it's not crazy to have that fear,</v>

3284
01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but then we can address that fear by talking about what actually happened.</v>

3285
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3286
01:34:35.081 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 1>why don't we implement some sort of a small scale version of this.</v>

3287
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:38.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3288
01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:40.270
<v Speaker 1>how come no one has ever tried to do this?</v>

3289
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:41.950
<v Speaker 1>You mean do it in Vermont?</v>

3290
01:34:41.951 --> 01:34:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Do it in New Hampshire doing a small state where there are loads of people who</v>

3291
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:45.761
<v Speaker 1>want to do that.</v>

3292
01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:47.560
<v Speaker 1>But the federal drug laws are federal,</v>

3293
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3294
01:34:47.861 --> 01:34:49.270
<v Speaker 1>So federal law supersedes,</v>

3295
01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:50.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3296
01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm at,</v>

3297
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:51.580
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen with cannabis.</v>

3298
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 1>So that was a,</v>

3299
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a big debate technically and legally the federal government could go off</v>

3300
01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 1>this Colorado,</v>

3301
01:34:58.731 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

3302
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a political decision to not do that because cannabis legalization is</v>

3303
01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:06.380
<v Speaker 1>popular in those places right there where people,</v>

3304
01:35:06.381 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Jeff sessions when he was the ag one,</v>

3305
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:08.654
<v Speaker 1>it's a general wanting,</v>

3306
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.553
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do that.</v>

3307
01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just our good luck that actually he pissed off Trump over something else.</v>

3308
01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.350
<v Speaker 1>The cause,</v>

3309
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.630
<v Speaker 1>the cause of the meter inquiring everything that Trump kind of,</v>

3310
01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:19.130
<v Speaker 1>despite Jeff sessions didn't line.</v>

3311
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So the federal banking laws actually mean that,</v>

3312
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3313
01:35:23.530 --> 01:35:26.180
<v Speaker 1>cannabis stores are operating in this weird gray area.</v>

3314
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:27.170
<v Speaker 1>They can't have bank account.</v>

3315
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:27.801
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>

3316
01:35:27.801 --> 01:35:29.510
<v Speaker 1>why is no one pushing this?</v>

3317
01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:29.721
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3318
01:35:29.721 --> 01:35:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Why is the world people are pushing that?</v>

3319
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3320
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.120
<v Speaker 1>So I think there are lots of people who are pushing this.</v>

3321
01:35:35.121 --> 01:35:39.140
<v Speaker 1>The amazing groups urge everyone to join and support the drug policy alliance on</v>

3322
01:35:39.141 --> 01:35:39.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3323
01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.020
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is why are no politician's ever discussing this?</v>

3324
01:35:42.021 --> 01:35:44.420
<v Speaker 1>This is never an option because those are the only ones that are going to really</v>

3325
01:35:44.421 --> 01:35:45.254
<v Speaker 1>change policy.</v>

3326
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 1>So we're seeing a big change in public opinion that is changed on many issues.</v>

3327
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So think about when Bill Clinton stopped being president,</v>

3328
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

3329
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:53.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3330
01:35:53.061 --> 01:35:54.320
<v Speaker 1>we remember there's not that long ago,</v>

3331
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:58.250
<v Speaker 1>16% of Americans supported legalizing cannabis.</v>

3332
01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Today 70% of Americans support legalizing cannabis.</v>

3333
01:36:01.710 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So extraordinary transformation,</v>

3334
01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 1>a very short period of time,</v>

3335
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:05.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3336
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Likely brought on by the fact that the medical use of it was prohibited up until</v>

3337
01:36:10.371 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

3338
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like 1994 right when it was passed.</v>

3339
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And then California has started doing it and then you started having positive</v>

3340
01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:22.190
<v Speaker 1>tax revenues from it and you started seeing people that were suffering from a</v>

3341
01:36:22.191 --> 01:36:26.930
<v Speaker 1>lot of ailments showing that they were helped substantially by cannabis.</v>

3342
01:36:26.931 --> 01:36:29.240
<v Speaker 1>And then the attitude of it changed in popular culture.</v>

3343
01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It changed.</v>

3344
01:36:30.190 --> 01:36:31.023
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

3345
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.900
<v Speaker 1>what's so crazy is that that reefer madness,</v>

3346
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.690
<v Speaker 1>reaper,</v>

3347
01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:35.940
<v Speaker 1>reefer madness proposition or the,</v>

3348
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:36.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3349
01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3350
01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:41.090
<v Speaker 1>propaganda rather was so effective that they did it in the 1930s and it carried</v>

3351
01:36:41.091 --> 01:36:43.220
<v Speaker 1>on into the 90s into the two thousands.</v>

3352
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:45.710
<v Speaker 1>There's still people alive today to believe some of that.</v>

3353
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I think you put that really well.</v>

3354
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I think as a series of things going on,</v>

3355
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:51.080
<v Speaker 1>partly what happened,</v>

3356
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:54.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the major,</v>

3357
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:59.720
<v Speaker 1>one of the major factors that make it possible for the drug war to continue is</v>

3358
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:02.000
<v Speaker 1>the dehumanization of people at every turn.</v>

3359
01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3360
01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Got The dehumanization of drug users.</v>

3361
01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny we should talk about use as opposed to addiction,</v>

3362
01:37:08.301 --> 01:37:09.134
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

3363
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:11.120
<v Speaker 1>dehumanization of drug users,</v>

3364
01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.130
<v Speaker 1>dehumanization of people with addiction problems,</v>

3365
01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.870
<v Speaker 1>dehumanization of drug dealers.</v>

3366
01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why one of the most sympathetic people in my book is a</v>

3367
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:19.310
<v Speaker 1>transgendered crack dealer called Chino Harden.</v>

3368
01:37:19.311 --> 01:37:23.300
<v Speaker 1>He's an amazing human being and dehumanization of people on the supply route</v>

3369
01:37:23.301 --> 01:37:23.751
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

3370
01:37:23.751 --> 01:37:26.510
<v Speaker 1>You're hearing the way people are talking about Mexicans now of powerful people</v>

3371
01:37:26.511 --> 01:37:27.344
<v Speaker 1>in this society.</v>

3372
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why chasing the scream is written as stories of people</v>

3373
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.890
<v Speaker 1>is because the solution to dehumanization is to re humanization.</v>

3374
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.230
<v Speaker 1>When I was meeting these people all over the world,</v>

3375
01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking</v>

3376
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:46.610
<v Speaker 1>if any ordinary American could meet Chino harder and my friend,</v>

3377
01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:49.310
<v Speaker 1>that transgender crack dealer who is hilarious and amazing,</v>

3378
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>if they could meet Bud Osborne,</v>

3379
01:37:51.291 --> 01:37:53.840
<v Speaker 1>the homeless street addict who started a movement in Canada,</v>

3380
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:55.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3381
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:56.580
<v Speaker 1>if they could meet Maricella,</v>

3382
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 4>they would not say that the deaths of these people mean nothing,</v>

3383
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:00.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3384
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 4>They would not say,</v>

3385
01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:01.471
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3386
01:38:01.471 --> 01:38:04.890
<v Speaker 4>let's pursue a policy that kills them cause we get some imaginary benefit</v>

3387
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:05.760
<v Speaker 4>further down the line.</v>

3388
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:05.941
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3389
01:38:05.941 --> 01:38:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Think about Lee Maddix,</v>

3390
01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:07.563
<v Speaker 4>the cop in Baltimore.</v>

3391
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 4>It was when Ed died.</v>

3392
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:09.670
<v Speaker 4>It was when her partner does Sheila,</v>

3393
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 4>what are we losing these people for?</v>

3394
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.720
<v Speaker 4>It's that moment or getting people to see everyone involved as human,</v>

3395
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3396
01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.370
<v Speaker 4>We're not there yet.</v>

3397
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Still the ways people are talking about addiction are,</v>

3398
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.713
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3399
01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.213
<v Speaker 3>repellent,</v>

3400
01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:24.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3401
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.410
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing of people as being weak.</v>

3402
01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I think of people's having poor willpower,</v>

3403
01:38:29.531 --> 01:38:30.460
<v Speaker 3>poor character,</v>

3404
01:38:30.461 --> 01:38:31.630
<v Speaker 3>and that's why they're addicted.</v>

3405
01:38:32.170 --> 01:38:33.640
<v Speaker 3>They're most people.</v>

3406
01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

3407
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's safe to venture,</v>

3408
01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:40.180
<v Speaker 3>aren't really fully aware of what the causes,</v>

3409
01:38:40.181 --> 01:38:43.300
<v Speaker 3>what the underlying causes of people becoming addicted to drugs in the first</v>

3410
01:38:43.301 --> 01:38:44.200
<v Speaker 3>place are and what,</v>

3411
01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:46.330
<v Speaker 3>what leads people this great sense of despair.</v>

3412
01:38:46.331 --> 01:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really about reengineering our entire culture.</v>

3413
01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:52.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean reengineering not just the way we treat addiction,</v>

3414
01:38:52.421 --> 01:38:55.210
<v Speaker 3>but the way we treat human beings where we treat poor neighborhoods.</v>

3415
01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:56.613
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

3416
01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:02.340
<v Speaker 3>there's so much that needs to be done that's never dressed totally right.</v>

3417
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:05.090
<v Speaker 3>And this one part of this,</v>

3418
01:39:05.091 --> 01:39:06.310
<v Speaker 3>this a funny</v>

3419
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 4>really one of the surprises me in this debate I have found is actually easier in</v>

3420
01:39:11.911 --> 01:39:16.911
<v Speaker 4>the u s to make the case for compassion for people with addiction problems than</v>

3421
01:39:17.281 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 4>to make the case for liberty for drug users who are not addicted.</v>

3422
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3423
01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:21.690
<v Speaker 4>So like we were saying,</v>

3424
01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.220
<v Speaker 4>even the main drug war body in the world,</v>

3425
01:39:23.221 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 4>the UN ODC,</v>

3426
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 4>you're an office of drug control admits 90% of all currently banned drug uses.</v>

3427
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 4>What's called non problematic,</v>

3428
01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:30.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3429
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:30.511
<v Speaker 4>Our friend,</v>

3430
01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:33.690
<v Speaker 4>professor call heart is the head of psychology at Columbia University and an</v>

3431
01:39:33.691 --> 01:39:37.560
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary human being has done really important work explaining this to</v>

3432
01:39:37.561 --> 01:39:38.394
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3433
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:42.300
<v Speaker 4>even with what we think of as the devil drugs like heroin crack.</v>

3434
01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:46.050
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority of people who use heroin and crack do not become addicted.</v>

3435
01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:46.530
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3436
01:39:46.530 --> 01:39:49.290
<v Speaker 4>Which I found really chat when Carl first explain that to me.</v>

3437
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:50.280
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3438
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 4>what's this guy talking about?</v>

3439
01:39:51.481 --> 01:39:54.510
<v Speaker 4>And then we looked at the scientific evidence that there is very clear evidence.</v>

3440
01:39:54.511 --> 01:39:55.270
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3441
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3442
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.810
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3443
01:39:55.810 --> 01:40:00.810
<v Speaker 4>the actually the ratio of people who use any drug he become addicted is pretty</v>

3444
01:40:01.141 --> 01:40:02.700
<v Speaker 4>consistently 10 to 20%.</v>

3445
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3446
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Slightly higher for things like heroin,</v>

3447
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty consistently in that zone.</v>

3448
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3449
01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 4>Which is not to say that there aren't other ha,</v>

3450
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.650
<v Speaker 4>heroin depresses your breathing.</v>

3451
01:40:10.651 --> 01:40:11.580
<v Speaker 4>It can cause death that way.</v>

3452
01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:12.720
<v Speaker 4>The other harms,</v>

3453
01:40:12.721 --> 01:40:13.620
<v Speaker 4>but which we might addiction.</v>

3454
01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:14.483
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3455
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:15.353
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3456
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:16.463
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

3457
01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:18.890
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

3458
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:22.760
<v Speaker 4>There's so much I think we need to explain to people.</v>

3459
01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.200
<v Speaker 4>One person here in La,</v>

3460
01:40:24.201 --> 01:40:26.540
<v Speaker 4>you really helped me to understand this and the research for the book.</v>

3461
01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Biggest guy called Professor Ronald Casey goal.</v>

3462
01:40:28.221 --> 01:40:28.640
<v Speaker 4>You should.</v>

3463
01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.720
<v Speaker 4>You should totally have in your shows.</v>

3464
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:30.710
<v Speaker 4>A very interesting guy.</v>

3465
01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:32.570
<v Speaker 4>He was an advisor to four American presidents.</v>

3466
01:40:32.571 --> 01:40:32.900
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>

3467
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.040
<v Speaker 4>who buys it?</v>

3468
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:35.000
<v Speaker 4>World Health Organization,</v>

3469
01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:36.350
<v Speaker 4>really serious scientists,</v>

3470
01:40:36.351 --> 01:40:38.000
<v Speaker 4>but he had a sideline for 30 years.</v>

3471
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:40.550
<v Speaker 4>We investigated animals using drugs,</v>

3472
01:40:40.551 --> 01:40:41.360
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3473
01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.310
<v Speaker 4>and he's basically shown loads of species love getting intoxicated for the</v>

3474
01:40:46.311 --> 01:40:46.851
<v Speaker 4>pleasure of it.</v>

3475
01:40:46.851 --> 01:40:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Right out elephants.</v>

3476
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:50.320
<v Speaker 4>Elephants like this is the amazing sample given bank.</v>

3477
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 4>All of elephants who broke into an alcohol store got drunk and just fucked up</v>

3478
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:54.874
<v Speaker 4>the whole village.</v>

3479
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:57.220
<v Speaker 4>If you give,</v>

3480
01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 4>if you give hash to mice,</v>

3481
01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.740
<v Speaker 4>what they do is they'll,</v>

3482
01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 4>they get really horny.</v>

3483
01:41:02.081 --> 01:41:03.510
<v Speaker 4>They tried to mail most,</v>

3484
01:41:03.511 --> 01:41:04.630
<v Speaker 4>we'll try to mount women,</v>

3485
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 4>but then they basically can't get up,</v>

3486
01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 4>so they just spend hours looking their own balls and they're going to cock semi</v>

3487
01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:10.843
<v Speaker 4>loads of examples.</v>

3488
01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 4>It's about a guy press a seagull.</v>

3489
01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.410
<v Speaker 4>I remember he told me at one point that he'd spent three years investigating</v>

3490
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:24.480
<v Speaker 4>grasshoppers in cannabis fields who just naturally live in cannabis fields to</v>

3491
01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:25.990
<v Speaker 4>figure out when they eat the cannabis,</v>

3492
01:41:25.991 --> 01:41:27.310
<v Speaker 4>do they jump higher or lower?</v>

3493
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:28.301
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

3494
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:29.620
<v Speaker 4>I write and at the end of your three years,</v>

3495
01:41:29.621 --> 01:41:30.490
<v Speaker 4>what did you discover?</v>

3496
01:41:30.491 --> 01:41:30.851
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

3497
01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:32.820
<v Speaker 4>they'd turns out they just jump the same height as everyone,</v>

3498
01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 4>all the other girls.</v>

3499
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:36.070
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't a great use of your three years of life.</v>

3500
01:41:36.071 --> 01:41:36.970
<v Speaker 4>But he also got the,</v>

3501
01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:38.820
<v Speaker 4>at an interesting time when he was in Hawaii,</v>

3502
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:42.970
<v Speaker 4>he was investigating mongoose where the mongoose is like hallucinogens,</v>

3503
01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.640
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics and he,</v>

3504
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:50.750
<v Speaker 4>so he's like spying on these mongooses with binoculars and he gets caught and he</v>

3505
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:54.680
<v Speaker 4>gets caught by a load of drug traffickers and like,</v>

3506
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck are you?</v>

3507
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.730
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

3508
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:56.563
<v Speaker 4>don't worry.</v>

3509
01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:58.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm just investigating with a mongoose is like psychedelics.</v>

3510
01:41:58.961 --> 01:42:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Like that is the worst fucking cupboard story we've ever had that held them</v>

3511
01:42:01.631 --> 01:42:02.560
<v Speaker 4>hostage for like two days.</v>

3512
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.160
<v Speaker 4>But what he showed is something I think is really important and there's loads of</v>

3513
01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:07.150
<v Speaker 4>other evidence for which is,</v>

3514
01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.593
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3515
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 4>it is absolutely a Nate to other species,</v>

3516
01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:13.870
<v Speaker 4>but especially to humans,</v>

3517
01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:15.940
<v Speaker 4>the desire to get intoxicated,</v>

3518
01:42:15.941 --> 01:42:16.420
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3519
01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:19.480
<v Speaker 4>There has never been a human society anywhere in the world where people didn't</v>

3520
01:42:19.481 --> 01:42:21.670
<v Speaker 4>seek out and toxicants and enjoy using them.</v>

3521
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:25.870
<v Speaker 4>The only society where there were no naturally occurring and toxicants was the</v>

3522
01:42:25.871 --> 01:42:26.250
<v Speaker 4>internet,</v>

3523
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:29.470
<v Speaker 4>the what we used to be called the Eskimos in the Arctic and they used to just</v>

3524
01:42:29.471 --> 01:42:33.430
<v Speaker 4>starve themselves to get a fucked up head state because that's how deep it is in</v>

3525
01:42:33.431 --> 01:42:34.090
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>

3526
01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:35.560
<v Speaker 4>If there is nothing in the star,</v>

3527
01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:37.180
<v Speaker 4>if you starve yourself long enough,</v>

3528
01:42:37.181 --> 01:42:39.460
<v Speaker 4>you get a kind of fucked up head state basically.</v>

3529
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:40.210
<v Speaker 4>How far,</v>

3530
01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:41.260
<v Speaker 4>how long are you going to go for?</v>

3531
01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3532
01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I looked into the details of it but he writes about that.</v>

3533
01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3534
01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.810
<v Speaker 4>but but so it's fasting.</v>

3535
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:47.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3536
01:42:47.741 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Fasting causes and ultra Ted state.</v>

3537
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:49.954
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

3538
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 4>I've never done it but this,</v>

3539
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:52.780
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3540
01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 4>this intoxication in is deep and human beings as the sexual impasse,</v>

3541
01:42:56.530 --> 01:42:57.850
<v Speaker 4>you even see it in small children.</v>

3542
01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:58.301
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3543
01:42:58.301 --> 01:42:58.811
<v Speaker 4>when little kid,</v>

3544
01:42:58.811 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 4>everyone will remember this memory of when you're a little kid and you realize</v>

3545
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:04.090
<v Speaker 4>you can spin round and round and round even though you know it will make you</v>

3546
01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:04.391
<v Speaker 4>sick,</v>

3547
01:43:04.391 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 4>you'd do it cause you get an altered headspace.</v>

3548
01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.460
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the first expressions of the kind of intoxication impulse or a</v>

3549
01:43:12.281 --> 01:43:14.950
<v Speaker 4>really nice example is for 2000 years,</v>

3550
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.940
<v Speaker 4>a 40 miles outside of Athens in ancient Greece,</v>

3551
01:43:18.941 --> 01:43:22.390
<v Speaker 4>they used to be once a year people would meet at something,</v>

3552
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Speaker 4>a place called the temple of elusiveness and it was basically burning man.</v>

3553
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:28.360
<v Speaker 4>They would all use a psychedelic together.</v>

3554
01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:30.010
<v Speaker 4>We now know what that target bellicose,</v>

3555
01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:30.701
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3556
01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:31.360
<v Speaker 4>it was a kind of,</v>

3557
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.560
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of different theories,</v>

3558
01:43:32.561 --> 01:43:34.480
<v Speaker 4>but they think it was a kind of fungus basically.</v>

3559
01:43:34.670 --> 01:43:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3560
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:36.310
<v Speaker 4>I got rid of the name of it,</v>

3561
01:43:36.311 --> 01:43:39.200
<v Speaker 4>but there's been some researchers and Simon or something.</v>

3562
01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:40.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3563
01:43:40.710 --> 01:43:41.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3564
01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:41.831
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it wrong.</v>

3565
01:43:41.831 --> 01:43:41.921
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3566
01:43:41.921 --> 01:43:42.581
<v Speaker 4>there was some kind of stuff,</v>

3567
01:43:42.581 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of stuff and like people like Plato and Eric Sanders,</v>

3568
01:43:46.511 --> 01:43:46.871
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>

3569
01:43:46.871 --> 01:43:47.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3570
01:43:47.091 --> 01:43:48.970
<v Speaker 4>drugs or William Bennett,</v>

3571
01:43:48.971 --> 01:43:52.610
<v Speaker 4>the former drugs are saying drugs are an attack on the foundations of Western</v>

3572
01:43:52.611 --> 01:43:53.241
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

3573
01:43:53.241 --> 01:43:53.481
<v Speaker 4>Or you're like,</v>

3574
01:43:53.481 --> 01:43:54.260
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3575
01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.190
<v Speaker 4>At the actual foundations of Western civilization that people your holding up as</v>

3576
01:43:58.191 --> 01:43:58.731
<v Speaker 4>the icons,</v>

3577
01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 4>like Plato and Aristotle were literally getting fucked up in exactly the way you</v>

3578
01:44:02.181 --> 01:44:03.140
<v Speaker 4>say as an attack on them,</v>

3579
01:44:03.141 --> 01:44:03.790
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3580
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:05.000
<v Speaker 4>It's this deep misunderstanding.</v>

3581
01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:07.520
<v Speaker 4>So this is a natural human impulse.</v>

3582
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 4>We are never going to get rid of it.</v>

3583
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:09.800
<v Speaker 4>We want to get rid of it.</v>

3584
01:44:09.801 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 4>It gives people a lot of joy and pleasure.</v>

3585
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:14.900
<v Speaker 4>And yet the Oscar Wilde said once,</v>

3586
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:16.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get the quote slightly wrong,</v>

3587
01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:16.731
<v Speaker 4>said it better than this,</v>

3588
01:44:16.731 --> 01:44:17.390
<v Speaker 4>but he said,</v>

3589
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 4>puritanism is the deep gnawing fear that someone somewhere is enjoying</v>

3590
01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:22.964
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

3591
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:26.470
<v Speaker 4>And there's this puritanical hatred of,</v>

3592
01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:27.281
<v Speaker 4>of drug east,</v>

3593
01:44:27.281 --> 01:44:28.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3594
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3595
01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.310
<v Speaker 4>now some of that is understandable fears,</v>

3596
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Matt genuine harms.</v>

3597
01:44:32.110 --> 01:44:32.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3598
01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 4>and that's a different thing,</v>

3599
01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.050
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of it is just very deep.</v>

3600
01:44:36.110 --> 01:44:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Puritanism and you've really seen it in one phrase.</v>

3601
01:44:39.771 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 4>We need to get,</v>

3602
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:42.890
<v Speaker 4>get out of the English language is the ridiculous phrase.</v>

3603
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Drugs and alcohol.</v>

3604
01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like saying fruit and apples.</v>

3605
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:48.230
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol is a drug,</v>

3606
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3607
01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll call is easily the deadliest drug in our culture.</v>

3608
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3609
01:44:52.670 --> 01:44:53.720
<v Speaker 4>well after tobacco.</v>

3610
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:55.003
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3611
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.281
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3612
01:44:55.281 --> 01:44:55.341
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3613
01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3614
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.121
<v Speaker 4>it's like saying,</v>

3615
01:44:56.121 --> 01:44:56.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3616
01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.750
<v Speaker 4>as my friend Steve Rolls his big campaign on this is it's like saying metal and</v>

3617
01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 4>iron,</v>

3618
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3619
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:02.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a meaningless phrase,</v>

3620
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.661
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3621
01:45:02.661 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3622
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 4>there's this distinction between an alcohol and other drugs.</v>

3623
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.590
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>

3624
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:08.540
<v Speaker 4>is a way of maintaining this drug war,</v>

3625
01:45:08.541 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3626
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Because the reality is the same proportion of people become addicted to alcohol</v>

3627
01:45:12.501 --> 01:45:13.820
<v Speaker 4>has become addicted to cocaine,</v>

3628
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:14.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3629
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:15.261
<v Speaker 4>Same proportion.</v>

3630
01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:15.510
<v Speaker 4>Not Saying,</v>

3631
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:16.710
<v Speaker 4>not absolute numbers can up.</v>

3632
01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:17.563
<v Speaker 4>We use our call.</v>

3633
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:18.483
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3634
01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:21.630
<v Speaker 4>risks from alcohol are very similar to restroom,</v>

3635
01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.191
<v Speaker 4>other drugs,</v>

3636
01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:22.341
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3637
01:45:22.341 --> 01:45:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

3638
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:26.630
<v Speaker 4>some of them are alcohol is significantly more dangerous than some drugs that</v>

3639
01:45:26.631 --> 01:45:27.650
<v Speaker 4>are currently banned.</v>

3640
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.843
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3641
01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.550
<v Speaker 4>but we with alcohol,</v>

3642
01:45:31.670 --> 01:45:34.580
<v Speaker 4>and it comes back to what you're saying about why we don't change these policies</v>

3643
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:35.810
<v Speaker 4>without alcohol.</v>

3644
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Enough people.</v>

3645
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3646
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows people who drink alcohol,</v>

3647
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3648
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:42.560
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons things changed on cannabis is because more people came</v>

3649
01:45:42.561 --> 01:45:43.490
<v Speaker 4>out and talked about it.</v>

3650
01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.390
<v Speaker 4>And so you had this situation where you've got Harry Anslinger saying,</v>

3651
01:45:47.391 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 4>if you use cannabis,</v>

3652
01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

3653
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:50.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3654
01:45:50.091 --> 01:45:51.410
<v Speaker 4>kill your family with an axe.</v>

3655
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:55.100
<v Speaker 4>By the time we get to the nineties enough people know enough people have used</v>

3656
01:45:55.101 --> 01:45:55.600
<v Speaker 4>cannabis to go,</v>

3657
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:55.761
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3658
01:45:55.761 --> 01:45:59.490
<v Speaker 4>Well Jimmy over there ain't a hot jacket chopping his family to death with an</v>

3659
01:45:59.491 --> 01:45:59.871
<v Speaker 4>ax.</v>

3660
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:00.410
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3661
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.741
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

3662
01:46:00.741 --> 01:46:01.574
<v Speaker 4>this is bullshit.</v>

3663
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:04.700
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the things we have to do is encourage people to talk.</v>

3664
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:09.470
<v Speaker 4>One of the weird things is the prohibition creates a distorted picture of</v>

3665
01:46:09.471 --> 01:46:10.880
<v Speaker 4>overall drug use,</v>

3666
01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:11.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3667
01:46:11.630 --> 01:46:14.270
<v Speaker 4>Because loads of your listeners might say on Facebook,</v>

3668
01:46:14.271 --> 01:46:14.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3669
01:46:14.541 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 4>I went out on Saturday night and I had you know,</v>

3670
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.080
<v Speaker 4>five vodka shots and I got hammered and had a great time.</v>

3671
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:23.120
<v Speaker 4>You'd be pretty foolish if you put on Facebook,</v>

3672
01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:23.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3673
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 4>a Saturday night I went out and have five lines of coke and I had a great night.</v>

3674
01:46:26.211 --> 01:46:26.451
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3675
01:46:26.451 --> 01:46:27.121
<v Speaker 4>You would be a fall.</v>

3676
01:46:27.121 --> 01:46:28.400
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people I fall.</v>

3677
01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.141
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you this,</v>

3678
01:46:30.141 --> 01:46:34.760
<v Speaker 4>is there a culture where there's no demonized use of drugs or alcohol?</v>

3679
01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Is there any culture that doesn't frown upon some drugs or have some forbidden</v>

3680
01:46:40.611 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 4>categories for drugs?</v>

3681
01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 4>What they'd been those societies throughout history,</v>

3682
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:45.651
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3683
01:46:45.651 --> 01:46:46.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean now,</v>

3684
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:47.783
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3685
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:51.300
<v Speaker 4>we've got to understand it in the of the war that Harry Anslinger imposed upon</v>

3686
01:46:51.301 --> 01:46:51.841
<v Speaker 4>the whole world,</v>

3687
01:46:51.841 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3688
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:53.730
<v Speaker 4>There was no country.</v>

3689
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:54.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3690
01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:55.650
<v Speaker 4>if you think about habits of Mexico,</v>

3691
01:46:55.651 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3692
01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.660
<v Speaker 4>So Mexico had,</v>

3693
01:46:57.690 --> 01:46:58.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3694
01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:01.230
<v Speaker 4>so the 1930s Anslinger says to the Mexicans,</v>

3695
01:47:01.231 --> 01:47:02.390
<v Speaker 4>you'll notice some real parallels.</v>

3696
01:47:02.410 --> 01:47:03.243
<v Speaker 4>What's happening now.</v>

3697
01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 4>You guys are responsible for our drug epidemic.</v>

3698
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:07.890
<v Speaker 4>You've got to band drugs and have a vicious war on drugs,</v>

3699
01:47:07.891 --> 01:47:08.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3700
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 4>And the Mexican government alike.</v>

3701
01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:11.723
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3702
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.650
<v Speaker 4>we can see the policies don't work for you.</v>

3703
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to do it.</v>

3704
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.140
<v Speaker 4>They had a drug saw,</v>

3705
01:47:16.141 --> 01:47:18.030
<v Speaker 4>a drug minister called Leopoldo Salazar.</v>

3706
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:18.541
<v Speaker 4>Viagra.</v>

3707
01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 4>They should build fucking statues.</v>

3708
01:47:19.711 --> 01:47:19.891
<v Speaker 4>Do.</v>

3709
01:47:19.891 --> 01:47:21.270
<v Speaker 4>No Man has ever been more prescient.</v>

3710
01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.980
<v Speaker 4>He explained to the Americans,</v>

3711
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:23.930
<v Speaker 4>we don't wanna Bang,</v>

3712
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:26.190
<v Speaker 4>cannabis is not particularly harmful with other drugs.</v>

3713
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 4>We should be writing people with compassionate care.</v>

3714
01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 4>And if we banned drugs,</v>

3715
01:47:29.850 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 4>the countries get,</v>

3716
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:32.460
<v Speaker 4>our country's going to be taken over by drug lords.</v>

3717
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.761
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3718
01:47:32.761 --> 01:47:34.770
<v Speaker 4>No one has ever been more right about anything.</v>

3719
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.053
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3720
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.500
<v Speaker 4>the Americans,</v>

3721
01:47:37.501 --> 01:47:38.390
<v Speaker 4>the u s stock,</v>

3722
01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:39.243
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3723
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 4>pressuring Mexico more and more.</v>

3724
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:42.120
<v Speaker 4>In the end,</v>

3725
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 4>they cut off.</v>

3726
01:47:44.590 --> 01:47:48.330
<v Speaker 4>So all opiates for pain relief used in hospitals were manufactured in the</v>

3727
01:47:48.331 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Americans in the United States at that time.</v>

3728
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:51.690
<v Speaker 4>They cut off the supply,</v>

3729
01:47:51.691 --> 01:47:52.524
<v Speaker 4>all of them.</v>

3730
01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.960
<v Speaker 4>People start dying in hospitals,</v>

3731
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:58.230
<v Speaker 4>all of Mexico and agony and the Mexicans given,</v>

3732
01:47:58.231 --> 01:48:01.200
<v Speaker 4>they fired this guy and they begin the drug war and the whole journey that leads</v>

3733
01:48:01.201 --> 01:48:01.511
<v Speaker 4>to Ross,</v>

3734
01:48:01.511 --> 01:48:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Salvia Hereto,</v>

3735
01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.350
<v Speaker 4>the guy and I from the Zetas and Marcel is death.</v>

3736
01:48:04.351 --> 01:48:06.060
<v Speaker 4>That that trajectory begins at that point,</v>

3737
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:08.520
<v Speaker 4>and this is something we haven't explained it I think is so important,</v>

3738
01:48:08.521 --> 01:48:09.354
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3739
01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 4>Actually really surprised me learning about the history of all this stuff at the</v>

3740
01:48:13.681 --> 01:48:14.790
<v Speaker 4>birth of the drug war,</v>

3741
01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:17.250
<v Speaker 4>it was intensely resisted,</v>

3742
01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3743
01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 4>I think about here in La,</v>

3744
01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:19.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3745
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:20.181
<v Speaker 4>In Los Angeles,</v>

3746
01:48:20.181 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 4>it was a doctor called Henry Smith Williams.</v>

3747
01:48:22.230 --> 01:48:23.700
<v Speaker 4>When heroin was band,</v>

3748
01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.730
<v Speaker 4>there was a deliberate loophole in the law that said,</v>

3749
01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:26.941
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3750
01:48:26.941 --> 01:48:27.930
<v Speaker 4>you can't sell heroin,</v>

3751
01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:30.360
<v Speaker 4>but doctors can prescribe it to people with addiction problems.</v>

3752
01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Just like what happened in Switzerland,</v>

3753
01:48:31.861 --> 01:48:32.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3754
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:33.200
<v Speaker 4>So here in La,</v>

3755
01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:36.360
<v Speaker 4>big heroin clinic prescribed Anslinger.</v>

3756
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:37.320
<v Speaker 4>It drives him crazy.</v>

3757
01:48:37.321 --> 01:48:38.340
<v Speaker 4>He wants to shut it down.</v>

3758
01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:42.330
<v Speaker 4>So the mayor of Los Angeles stands in front of this heroin prescription clinic</v>

3759
01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:42.750
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

3760
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:44.100
<v Speaker 4>you will not shut this down.</v>

3761
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:45.030
<v Speaker 4>This does a good job for us.</v>

3762
01:48:45.031 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 4>But answering shuts it down.</v>

3763
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.230
<v Speaker 4>When the doctors say to the,</v>

3764
01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.790
<v Speaker 4>there's the biggest crackdown on doctors in American history,</v>

3765
01:48:50.791 --> 01:48:53.520
<v Speaker 4>over 12,000 doctors are arrested and rounded up.</v>

3766
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:54.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3767
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 4>when they come to the one in Portland,</v>

3768
01:48:56.371 --> 01:48:57.204
<v Speaker 4>Oregon,</v>

3769
01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:57.871
<v Speaker 4>the doctors say,</v>

3770
01:48:57.871 --> 01:49:00.720
<v Speaker 4>but what are we meant to do with all these vulnerable addictive people?</v>

3771
01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:02.730
<v Speaker 4>And one of the agents that go and throw them in the leg,</v>

3772
01:49:02.731 --> 01:49:03.870
<v Speaker 4>they'll make good fish food.</v>

3773
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.201
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3774
01:49:04.201 --> 01:49:05.160
<v Speaker 4>That was the attitude.</v>

3775
01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.473
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3776
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:09.750
<v Speaker 4>so this is resisted intensely at the birth of the drug war.</v>

3777
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:13.740
<v Speaker 4>So you had a society really recently that had a much more mature,</v>

3778
01:49:13.770 --> 01:49:17.430
<v Speaker 4>exactly what you're asking about a much more mature attitude to drug use than we</v>

3779
01:49:17.431 --> 01:49:17.881
<v Speaker 4>have now.</v>

3780
01:49:17.881 --> 01:49:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3781
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not that people thought all drug use is good.</v>

3782
01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:22.560
<v Speaker 4>We should celebrate every instance of drug use.</v>

3783
01:49:22.561 --> 01:49:23.371
<v Speaker 4>No one thinks that.</v>

3784
01:49:23.371 --> 01:49:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3785
01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.510
<v Speaker 4>They were problems and there were,</v>

3786
01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.870
<v Speaker 4>there is some joy associated with drug use.</v>

3787
01:49:27.871 --> 01:49:28.800
<v Speaker 4>That's actually the norm.</v>

3788
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:32.820
<v Speaker 4>There is some pain and terrible things associated with drug use,</v>

3789
01:49:32.821 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 4>which are mostly driven by underlying harm,</v>

3790
01:49:34.921 --> 01:49:35.940
<v Speaker 4>but there are real homes,</v>

3791
01:49:36.150 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 4>the come from some drugs as well.</v>

3792
01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:38.873
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3793
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:42.930
<v Speaker 4>and most societies until very recently had a mature appreciation of this,</v>

3794
01:49:42.931 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3795
01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

3796
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 4>we are the outlier that most societies have had licensed</v>

3797
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.530
<v Speaker 1>in toxicants.</v>

3798
01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3799
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.770
<v Speaker 1>now of course in different societies at different Tyler was,</v>

3800
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I was the czar of Russia who wanted to ban tobacco,</v>

3801
01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:55.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3802
01:49:55.181 --> 01:49:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And did terrible things to anyone who was found with tobacco.</v>

3803
01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Different societies have had different panics at different times,</v>

3804
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:02.643
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

3805
01:50:04.650 --> 01:50:06.360
<v Speaker 1>we are the historical outliers,</v>

3806
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:07.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3807
01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:07.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3808
01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:11.040
<v Speaker 1>to give you a sense of just the United States in prisons,</v>

3809
01:50:11.041 --> 01:50:11.910
<v Speaker 1>2 million people,</v>

3810
01:50:11.911 --> 01:50:16.020
<v Speaker 1>that has never been a society that imprisons this many of its citizens,</v>

3811
01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:19.170
<v Speaker 1>this higher proportion of its citizens anywhere ever.</v>

3812
01:50:19.171 --> 01:50:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's overwhelmingly driven by the drug war,</v>

3813
01:50:20.850 --> 01:50:21.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3814
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean the u s in prison,</v>

3815
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:27.060
<v Speaker 1>so many people and the conditions in those prisons are so terrible that the</v>

3816
01:50:27.061 --> 01:50:30.960
<v Speaker 1>United States is almost certainly the first society ever were more men had been</v>

3817
01:50:30.961 --> 01:50:31.201
<v Speaker 1>raped.</v>

3818
01:50:31.201 --> 01:50:34.080
<v Speaker 1>The women pass how extreme this,</v>

3819
01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:35.280
<v Speaker 1>this war is,</v>

3820
01:50:35.281 --> 01:50:36.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3821
01:50:36.090 --> 01:50:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And what we do to people in what this,</v>

3822
01:50:38.251 --> 01:50:38.750
<v Speaker 1>what this,</v>

3823
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:39.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3824
01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3825
01:50:39.810 --> 01:50:40.621
<v Speaker 1>the conditions.</v>

3826
01:50:40.621 --> 01:50:42.290
<v Speaker 1>This war creates it</v>

3827
01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's a total historical outlier.</v>

3828
01:50:47.231 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 1>We are in a freak experiment.</v>

3829
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3830
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:51.910
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing you can say in defense of the drug war,</v>

3831
01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and I would give one bit of credit for this,</v>

3832
01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:55.930
<v Speaker 1>is we gave it a fair shot,</v>

3833
01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:56.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3834
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.690
<v Speaker 1>The United States has done it for a hundred years.</v>

3835
01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 1>This country has spent $1 trillion on it.</v>

3836
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3837
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:05.620
<v Speaker 1>we've imprisoned millions of our own citizens.</v>

3838
01:51:05.621 --> 01:51:06.050
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

3839
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:09.190
<v Speaker 1>we killed hundreds of thousands of people that are conservative estimate.</v>

3840
01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.660
<v Speaker 1>We've destroyed whole countries.</v>

3841
01:51:10.661 --> 01:51:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Like Colombia isn't the problem now that there's a gigantic business behind it</v>

3842
01:51:14.351 --> 01:51:17.470
<v Speaker 1>all from private prisons to prison guard unions,</v>

3843
01:51:17.471 --> 01:51:20.950
<v Speaker 1>to the pharmaceutical industry that would benefit from keeping most of these</v>

3844
01:51:20.951 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 1>drugs illegal.</v>

3845
01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:26.350
<v Speaker 1>So their profits continue to rise to law enforcement.</v>

3846
01:51:26.351 --> 01:51:26.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3847
01:51:26.651 --> 01:51:27.890
<v Speaker 1>down the line it's,</v>

3848
01:51:28.150 --> 01:51:31.570
<v Speaker 1>you'd be disrupting like an evil industry,</v>

3849
01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but an industry,</v>

3850
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real factor,</v>

3851
01:51:34.301 --> 01:51:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to overstate it.</v>

3852
01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Lots of policies have best in each factor.</v>

3853
01:51:38.171 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 1>What's the main factor?</v>

3854
01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.260
<v Speaker 1>The main factor is</v>

3855
01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:43.880
<v Speaker 1>most people are asked,</v>

3856
01:51:43.881 --> 01:51:45.260
<v Speaker 1>do you think the drug war has failed?</v>

3857
01:51:45.261 --> 01:51:46.094
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

3858
01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And most people ask,</v>

3859
01:51:47.121 --> 01:51:49.100
<v Speaker 1>do you want to legalize any drug other than cannabis?</v>

3860
01:51:49.101 --> 01:51:49.581
<v Speaker 1>Say No.</v>

3861
01:51:49.581 --> 01:51:50.091
<v Speaker 1>Very strong.</v>

3862
01:51:50.091 --> 01:51:51.080
<v Speaker 1>So education,</v>

3863
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about,</v>

3864
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:55.940
<v Speaker 1>we use the word education can give you an example of a specific person who I</v>

3865
01:51:55.941 --> 01:51:57.320
<v Speaker 1>think showed a way to do this.</v>

3866
01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:58.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3867
01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:01.670
<v Speaker 1>so in the year 2000 in Vancouver,</v>

3868
01:52:01.671 --> 01:52:05.240
<v Speaker 1>there was a homeless street addict called bottles bomb and he lived in a</v>

3869
01:52:05.241 --> 01:52:07.700
<v Speaker 1>notorious part of Vancouver called the downtown east side.</v>

3870
01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:08.480
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3871
01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:08.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3872
01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.550
<v Speaker 1>people in Vancouver Pippins Franco Nero.</v>

3873
01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:10.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3874
01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:13.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a place particular at that time that had um,</v>

3875
01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:14.720
<v Speaker 1>really high,</v>

3876
01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>like nightmarish opened drug scene.</v>

3877
01:52:16.461 --> 01:52:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>

3878
01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.091
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3879
01:52:17.091 --> 01:52:18.050
<v Speaker 1>people it like in Switzerland,</v>

3880
01:52:18.051 --> 01:52:19.100
<v Speaker 1>people injecting in the streets,</v>

3881
01:52:19.101 --> 01:52:19.934
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

3882
01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And Bod was living homeless and he was watching his friends die all around him.</v>

3883
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:29.840
<v Speaker 1>At that time there was a really big police crackdown.</v>

3884
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3885
01:52:31.190 --> 01:52:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and so people would go and like hide and dumpsters or in alleyways to shoot up.</v>

3886
01:52:35.631 --> 01:52:37.550
<v Speaker 1>But obviously if you're hiding and you overdose,</v>

3887
01:52:37.551 --> 01:52:38.121
<v Speaker 1>no one sees it,</v>

3888
01:52:38.121 --> 01:52:38.600
<v Speaker 1>you just die.</v>

3889
01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:39.433
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3890
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:40.303
<v Speaker 1>And one day bud,</v>

3891
01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:41.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3892
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:44.030
<v Speaker 1>he learns at one of his friends Judith had had died.</v>

3893
01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.620
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

3894
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.700
<v Speaker 4>I can't just sit here and wait for my friends to tie them for me to die.</v>

3895
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 4>But as bud would have put it down,</v>

3896
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 4>he also thought I'm a homeless junkie.</v>

3897
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck am I going to do?</v>

3898
01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:54.783
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3899
01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:56.210
<v Speaker 4>But had a really simple idea,</v>

3900
01:52:57.010 --> 01:53:00.620
<v Speaker 4>he gathered together a group of the other homeless street addicts and he said,</v>

3901
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3902
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 4>when we're not using,</v>

3903
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:03.530
<v Speaker 4>which is most of the time,</v>

3904
01:53:03.531 --> 01:53:04.760
<v Speaker 4>even people on the streets,</v>

3905
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 4>what we should do is just drop a timetable and go and look in the places where</v>

3906
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:10.550
<v Speaker 4>we know people,</v>

3907
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:11.743
<v Speaker 4>where we she up.</v>

3908
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.961
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3909
01:53:11.961 --> 01:53:12.794
<v Speaker 4>And if we see someone over,</v>

3910
01:53:12.810 --> 01:53:13.643
<v Speaker 4>we'll ring an ambulance,</v>

3911
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:14.631
<v Speaker 4>no officials,</v>

3912
01:53:14.631 --> 01:53:15.231
<v Speaker 4>nothing like that.</v>

3913
01:53:15.231 --> 01:53:16.064
<v Speaker 4>Just us.</v>

3914
01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.220
<v Speaker 4>And loads of people had descended on the downtown east side to come up with</v>

3915
01:53:19.221 --> 01:53:20.570
<v Speaker 4>problems to solve everything.</v>

3916
01:53:21.170 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 4>And people were very skeptical,</v>

3917
01:53:22.161 --> 01:53:23.120
<v Speaker 4>but they liked bud.</v>

3918
01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

3919
01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:24.080
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3920
01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3921
01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Duh.</v>

3922
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:28.280
<v Speaker 4>So they start going and searching and um,</v>

3923
01:53:28.610 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 4>over the next three months,</v>

3924
01:53:29.691 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 4>the downtown that the death toll on the downtown east side like had a</v>

3925
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:33.470
<v Speaker 4>significant fall.</v>

3926
01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.470
<v Speaker 4>And obviously that meant people who would have died were living,</v>

3927
01:53:36.471 --> 01:53:37.161
<v Speaker 4>which is a great thing,</v>

3928
01:53:37.161 --> 01:53:38.840
<v Speaker 4>but it also meant the addicts thought,</v>

3929
01:53:38.841 --> 01:53:39.290
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3930
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:40.640
<v Speaker 4>maybe we're not the pieces of shit.</v>

3931
01:53:40.641 --> 01:53:41.840
<v Speaker 4>Everyone says we are right.</v>

3932
01:53:41.841 --> 01:53:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we can do something.</v>

3933
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

3934
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.631
<v Speaker 4>what else can we do?</v>

3935
01:53:44.631 --> 01:53:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Bud went to the library.</v>

3936
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:47.270
<v Speaker 4>He learned in Frankfurt.</v>

3937
01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:48.133
<v Speaker 4>In Germany,</v>

3938
01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:49.940
<v Speaker 4>they'd opened safe injection rooms,</v>

3939
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 4>but like what happened in California until they shut it down,</v>

3940
01:53:51.861 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Anslinger shut it down when people could go and use their drugs and be watched</v>

3941
01:53:55.311 --> 01:53:58.280
<v Speaker 4>by doctors and nurses and that this had massively reduced deaths in Frankfurt.</v>

3942
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Nothing like this had happened in the United States since Anslinger shut it all</v>

3943
01:54:01.671 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

3944
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:03.283
<v Speaker 4>but buds like,</v>

3945
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:04.663
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3946
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:05.720
<v Speaker 4>we'll persuade our map.</v>

3947
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 4>They set up a group called van do the Vancouver Area Network of drug users.</v>

3948
01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.513
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3949
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:14.910
<v Speaker 4>The Mare was a conservative right wing guy called Philip [inaudible] who have</v>

3950
01:54:14.911 --> 01:54:15.920
<v Speaker 4>been American comparison.</v>

3951
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.233
<v Speaker 4>It's not Trump.</v>

3952
01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:18.083
<v Speaker 4>Mitt Romney,</v>

3953
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:20.120
<v Speaker 4>rich guy from a privileged family didn't get,</v>

3954
01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:21.290
<v Speaker 4>didn't know anything about addicts.</v>

3955
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.741
<v Speaker 4>He'd,</v>

3956
01:54:21.741 --> 01:54:25.400
<v Speaker 4>he'd run for office saying all the local drug addict should be located to be</v>

3957
01:54:25.401 --> 01:54:29.030
<v Speaker 4>taken and detained to the local military base and Chilliwack and never let out</v>

3958
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:30.530
<v Speaker 4>if she sends where he's coming from.</v>

3959
01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3960
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:33.140
<v Speaker 4>People are not optimistic about persuading him.</v>

3961
01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Van Do bud,</v>

3962
01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 4>his friends,</v>

3963
01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:39.860
<v Speaker 4>they decide everywhere Philipo and goes,</v>

3964
01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:44.330
<v Speaker 4>they're going to follow him with a coffin and the coffin had written on it.</v>

3965
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Who will die next?</v>

3966
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:49.760
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] before you open a safe injection site every time.</v>

3967
01:54:49.761 --> 01:54:51.500
<v Speaker 4>But if I own spoken public,</v>

3968
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 4>one of the homeless people with addiction problems would stand up and say he</v>

3969
01:54:55.611 --> 01:54:58.940
<v Speaker 4>will dine xsplit poem before you open a safe injection site.</v>

3970
01:54:59.370 --> 01:55:00.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3971
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:00.711
<v Speaker 4>one day,</v>

3972
01:55:00.711 --> 01:55:01.341
<v Speaker 4>Dean Wilson,</v>

3973
01:55:01.341 --> 01:55:03.080
<v Speaker 4>one of the main people in van do stood up and said,</v>

3974
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:05.330
<v Speaker 4>do you remember Julia who asked you recently?</v>

3975
01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:06.200
<v Speaker 4>He would die next.</v>

3976
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 4>It turned out to be her because you haven't done it right.</v>

3977
01:55:09.410 --> 01:55:10.520
<v Speaker 4>This goes on for a long time.</v>

3978
01:55:10.521 --> 01:55:12.320
<v Speaker 4>They do loads of public actions.</v>

3979
01:55:12.321 --> 01:55:14.660
<v Speaker 4>They filled Oppenheimer Park,</v>

3980
01:55:14.661 --> 01:55:19.190
<v Speaker 4>which big park in Vancouver with a cross more than a thousand crosses each one</v>

3981
01:55:19.191 --> 01:55:20.870
<v Speaker 4>representing someone who had died of an overdose.</v>

3982
01:55:20.871 --> 01:55:25.130
<v Speaker 4>And they wrote the names of the people on the crosses and one day after it's</v>

3983
01:55:25.131 --> 01:55:26.300
<v Speaker 4>been going on for years,</v>

3984
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.010
<v Speaker 4>it totally tastes credit.</v>

3985
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:28.940
<v Speaker 4>Filippo in just said,</v>

3986
01:55:28.941 --> 01:55:30.320
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck are these people?</v>

3987
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:31.243
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

3988
01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.860
<v Speaker 4>And he went to meet loads of the addicts.</v>

3989
01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:34.731
<v Speaker 4>He sat with them.</v>

3990
01:55:34.731 --> 01:55:35.564
<v Speaker 4>It blew his mind.</v>

3991
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.840
<v Speaker 4>He thought people with addiction poems,</v>

3992
01:55:36.850 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 4>which just people who partied too hard indulge themselves,</v>

3993
01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.460
<v Speaker 4>he was completely shocked.</v>

3994
01:55:40.670 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 4>He came here to the Untied States to meet Milton Friedman,</v>

3995
01:55:44.251 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 4>the Nobel prize winning economist who grown up under alcohol prohibition and</v>

3996
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:51.880
<v Speaker 4>Milton Freeman Explains Drug Prohibition to Phillip it,</v>

3997
01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 4>but upon comes back to Vancouver and it holds a press conference and had the</v>

3998
01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:56.484
<v Speaker 4>chief of police,</v>

3999
01:55:56.970 --> 01:56:00.240
<v Speaker 4>the coroner and a representative of the addicts and he says something like,</v>

4000
01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to speak again without having the addicts here with me about</v>

4001
01:56:03.781 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 4>addiction because they understand it better than me.</v>

4002
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:09.690
<v Speaker 4>We're going to open the first safe injection site in North America.</v>

4003
01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:12.840
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have the most compassionate drug policies in North America.</v>

4004
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:14.670
<v Speaker 4>Things are gonna change around here,</v>

4005
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:15.743
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4006
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:17.310
<v Speaker 4>The open safe injection site.</v>

4007
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:18.000
<v Speaker 4>Filippo,</v>

4008
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.980
<v Speaker 4>his right wing party is so horrified.</v>

4009
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:23.820
<v Speaker 4>They de-select him as this is the candidate and his whole political career ends.</v>

4010
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:27.150
<v Speaker 4>But a more liberal guy wins the election in the room stays open.</v>

4011
01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4012
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:29.400
<v Speaker 4>In the 10 years that followed,</v>

4013
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:34.630
<v Speaker 4>overdose deaths on the downtown east side fell by 80% eight 0% right?</v>

4014
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Average life expectancy in that neighborhood rose by 10 years.</v>

4015
01:56:38.370 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 4>You just don't get figures like that very often.</v>

4016
01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:43.530
<v Speaker 4>And I remember the reason I say it in relation to change,</v>

4017
01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:44.581
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

4018
01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:47.430
<v Speaker 4>a big part of what I argue in chasing the scream animal but lost connections is,</v>

4019
01:56:47.431 --> 01:56:47.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4020
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:48.474
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4021
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:49.680
<v Speaker 4>you don't write people off,</v>

4022
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:50.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4023
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:53.460
<v Speaker 4>But I realized I would have written off Philipo in</v>

4024
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.560
<v Speaker 4>right wing guy runs for saying we should lock them all up in the military base.</v>

4025
01:56:58.561 --> 01:56:59.394
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4026
01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:01.050
<v Speaker 4>You don't run off anyone.</v>

4027
01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 4>You don't know who can be persuaded by message of love and compassion and the</v>

4028
01:57:05.011 --> 01:57:06.150
<v Speaker 4>most unlikely,</v>

4029
01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:09.570
<v Speaker 4>one of the biggest champions of my book is a conservative Evangelical Christian</v>

4030
01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:10.501
<v Speaker 4>in Mississippi.</v>

4031
01:57:10.501 --> 01:57:10.651
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

4032
01:57:10.651 --> 01:57:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Christina Dennett who's doing incredible work with this,</v>

4033
01:57:13.621 --> 01:57:13.780
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4034
01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:16.560
<v Speaker 4>And I thought a lot about Filippone when I went to go and see Phillip Ahmed on</v>

4035
01:57:16.561 --> 01:57:19.020
<v Speaker 4>the downtown east side and he said to me,</v>

4036
01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:23.370
<v Speaker 4>he would sacrifice his entire political career all over again given the chance</v>

4037
01:57:23.371 --> 01:57:24.110
<v Speaker 4>for this course.</v>

4038
01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:24.481
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

4039
01:57:24.481 --> 01:57:28.410
<v Speaker 4>how often do you get to save thousands of lives at the most vulnerable people?</v>

4040
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:30.180
<v Speaker 4>And after I got to know Bud Osborne,</v>

4041
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 4>the guy who started this movement,</v>

4042
01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.673
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4043
01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:34.710
<v Speaker 4>he died.</v>

4044
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:35.120
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4045
01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:35.550
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

4046
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:36.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4047
01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:36.980
<v Speaker 4>and I remember,</v>

4048
01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:37.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4049
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:38.310
<v Speaker 4>he's only in his early sixties,</v>

4050
01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:41.040
<v Speaker 4>but he'd been a homeless addict during a drug war.</v>

4051
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:42.060
<v Speaker 4>It takes a toll on you.</v>

4052
01:57:43.050 --> 01:57:46.350
<v Speaker 4>And they sealed off the streets of the downtown east side where bought had lived</v>

4053
01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:49.830
<v Speaker 4>as a homeless person and they had this incredible memorial ceremony.</v>

4054
01:57:49.831 --> 01:57:53.370
<v Speaker 4>And there were loads of people at that ceremony who knew that they were alive</v>

4055
01:57:53.371 --> 01:57:54.720
<v Speaker 4>because of what buttered started.</v>

4056
01:57:54.721 --> 01:57:57.360
<v Speaker 4>And because so many other people had joined them and so many people who didn't</v>

4057
01:57:57.361 --> 01:57:59.220
<v Speaker 4>have addiction problems that opened their hearts.</v>

4058
01:57:59.221 --> 01:58:00.054
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4059
01:58:00.570 --> 01:58:02.070
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking that day,</v>

4060
01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:03.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4061
01:58:03.631 --> 01:58:05.790
<v Speaker 4>when you get disheartened about this as easy to get disheartened,</v>

4062
01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4063
01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:07.560
<v Speaker 4>This is a hundred year long drug war.</v>

4064
01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.293
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4065
01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:11.490
<v Speaker 4>we're up against very powerful forces.</v>

4066
01:58:13.290 --> 01:58:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Everyone watching your show,</v>

4067
01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Speaker 4>listening to your show is more powerful than bud was that day,</v>

4068
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:18.361
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4069
01:58:18.361 --> 01:58:19.350
<v Speaker 4>The day he started that,</v>

4070
01:58:19.530 --> 01:58:20.363
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4071
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:21.361
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

4072
01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:23.580
<v Speaker 4>by virtue of the fact they have a device on which to listen to this,</v>

4073
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:24.210
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4074
01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:28.200
<v Speaker 4>but didn't sit there thinking someone else is going to handle this.</v>

4075
01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:29.420
<v Speaker 4>He didn't sit there thinking,</v>

4076
01:58:29.421 --> 01:58:29.620
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4077
01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.453
<v Speaker 4>well this is,</v>

4078
01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.940
<v Speaker 4>we're up against these forces that can't be defeated.</v>

4079
01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:34.680
<v Speaker 4>He started where he stood.</v>

4080
01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 4>He appealed to the people around him and it started this circle of change that,</v>

4081
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:38.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4082
01:58:38.731 --> 01:58:42.880
<v Speaker 4>the Canadian Supreme Court ruled because the right wing government of Stephen</v>

4083
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.410
<v Speaker 4>Harper tried to shut down this injection site.</v>

4084
01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4085
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 4>and the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that people with addiction promise have a</v>

4086
01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 4>right to light,</v>

4087
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:49.960
<v Speaker 4>to live,</v>

4088
01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.930
<v Speaker 4>and that includes a safe place to use their drugs that will never be taken away</v>

4089
01:58:52.931 --> 01:58:53.141
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

4090
01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:53.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4091
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:54.550
<v Speaker 4>That static is one.</v>

4092
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:55.384
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

4093
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 4>when you have nothing else,</v>

4094
01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.290
<v Speaker 4>you have a voice.</v>

4095
01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 4>You have a human voice that you can use to persuade other people with love and</v>

4096
01:59:04.301 --> 01:59:05.134
<v Speaker 4>compassion.</v>

4097
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.000
<v Speaker 4>You can tell them stories,</v>

4098
01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:11.080
<v Speaker 4>you can build people's love and compassion in the middle of this catastrophe</v>

4099
01:59:11.081 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 4>that we're seeing in this country with the addiction crisis,</v>

4100
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:13.810
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4101
01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:17.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean more people died last year and the opiod crisis than all the soldiers who</v>

4102
01:59:17.741 --> 01:59:19.120
<v Speaker 4>died in the Vietnam war combined</v>

4103
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.360
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of this catastrophe.</v>

4104
01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.850
<v Speaker 4>We can carry on doing what we've been doing.</v>

4105
01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:25.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4106
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:26.800
<v Speaker 4>We can carry on doing that,</v>

4107
01:59:26.801 --> 01:59:29.770
<v Speaker 4>then we will continue to get the horrific results we are now getting.</v>

4108
01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 4>We can continue to copy the places that have failed,</v>

4109
01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:33.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4110
01:59:33.670 --> 01:59:35.350
<v Speaker 4>At the end of a hundred year long drug war,</v>

4111
01:59:35.351 --> 01:59:36.610
<v Speaker 4>those cost $1 trillion.</v>

4112
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:41.770
<v Speaker 4>We can't even keep drugs out of our prisons where we have a wool perimeter and</v>

4113
01:59:41.771 --> 01:59:43.510
<v Speaker 4>we pay people to walk around at the whole time.</v>

4114
01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:47.590
<v Speaker 4>So good luck keeping them out of a 3000 mile border.</v>

4115
01:59:47.710 --> 01:59:47.951
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4116
01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:49.060
<v Speaker 4>That will never happen.</v>

4117
01:59:49.061 --> 01:59:50.680
<v Speaker 4>That is a ludicrous fantasy.</v>

4118
01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:53.860
<v Speaker 4>He may as well take all the money that will be spent on trying to keep drugs</v>

4119
01:59:53.861 --> 01:59:53.981
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

4120
01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:55.300
<v Speaker 4>That way I'm burning it in a pile.</v>

4121
01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:55.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4122
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Is absurd.</v>

4123
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 4>There's never been such a society.</v>

4124
01:59:59.130 --> 01:59:59.963
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4125
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:02.590
<v Speaker 4>all we can start to copy the places that have succeeded,</v>

4126
02:00:02.591 --> 02:00:03.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4127
02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:04.001
<v Speaker 4>Portugal,</v>

4128
02:00:04.001 --> 02:00:04.810
<v Speaker 4>Switzerland,</v>

4129
02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Urgh why Canada?</v>

4130
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:11.830
<v Speaker 4>There are plenty of places that have tried the alternatives and people who were</v>

4131
02:00:11.831 --> 02:00:12.641
<v Speaker 4>quite skeptical.</v>

4132
02:00:12.641 --> 02:00:16.360
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing that was most striking to me and all those places is that people</v>

4133
02:00:16.361 --> 02:00:18.160
<v Speaker 4>who were initially skeptical</v>

4134
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.400
<v Speaker 4>and initially thought it was crazy,</v>

4135
02:00:21.401 --> 02:00:22.990
<v Speaker 4>very often change their minds.</v>

4136
02:00:22.991 --> 02:00:24.280
<v Speaker 4>This is the consistent pattern</v>

4137
02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:26.830
<v Speaker 4>before it happens.</v>

4138
02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:29.140
<v Speaker 4>People think it's the work of bunch of fucking Wackos.</v>

4139
02:00:29.141 --> 02:00:30.400
<v Speaker 4>They think why people would want to,</v>

4140
02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:30.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4141
02:00:30.851 --> 02:00:32.800
<v Speaker 4>get everyone to use drugs and get children to use drugs.</v>

4142
02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:33.820
<v Speaker 4>I think it's madness.</v>

4143
02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:37.210
<v Speaker 4>And then they see that that's not at all what motivates people who want reform.</v>

4144
02:00:37.211 --> 02:00:38.044
<v Speaker 4>And that's not,</v>

4145
02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:41.200
<v Speaker 4>that's not what happens in practice when you,</v>

4146
02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.870
<v Speaker 4>when you adopt these policies and it's not a magic bullet and they still have</v>

4147
02:00:43.871 --> 02:00:44.650
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>

4148
02:00:44.650 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 4>but there's been such a significant improvement in all those places that the</v>

4149
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 4>resistance tends to,</v>

4150
02:00:50.670 --> 02:00:50.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4151
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:53.350
<v Speaker 4>how many people arguing for reversing the cannabis legalization?</v>

4152
02:00:53.351 --> 02:00:53.501
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4153
02:00:53.501 --> 02:00:54.490
<v Speaker 4>you don't ever hear it now.</v>

4154
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4155
02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:57.280
<v Speaker 4>And it's been a little bit of a backlash and it kind of absurd.</v>

4156
02:00:57.281 --> 02:01:00.120
<v Speaker 4>But because it's come out repeatedly kind of victor lie carters.</v>

4157
02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:00.751
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4158
02:01:00.751 --> 02:01:02.150
<v Speaker 3>I actually had that guy,</v>

4159
02:01:02.190 --> 02:01:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I really tell me about why.</v>

4160
02:01:03.801 --> 02:01:04.051
<v Speaker 3>How did it,</v>

4161
02:01:04.051 --> 02:01:08.200
<v Speaker 3>we had a debate between him and Alex parents,</v>

4162
02:01:08.201 --> 02:01:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Dean and a doctor,</v>

4163
02:01:09.591 --> 02:01:10.860
<v Speaker 3>Mike Hart from Canada.</v>

4164
02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4165
02:01:11.730 --> 02:01:13.650
<v Speaker 3>and there's some,</v>

4166
02:01:13.710 --> 02:01:17.970
<v Speaker 3>there's some reality to the dangers of cannabis use as some people that are</v>

4167
02:01:17.971 --> 02:01:19.410
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to schizophrenia.</v>

4168
02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4169
02:01:20.490 --> 02:01:22.350
<v Speaker 3>and I think that there's also some,</v>

4170
02:01:22.351 --> 02:01:25.710
<v Speaker 3>at least anecdotal evidence that points to the fact that some people experience</v>

4171
02:01:25.711 --> 02:01:30.570
<v Speaker 3>the psychotic breaks and these schizophrenia episodes probably directly as a</v>

4172
02:01:30.571 --> 02:01:34.050
<v Speaker 3>result of large dose use of Thc,</v>

4173
02:01:34.051 --> 02:01:37.200
<v Speaker 3>whether it's through edibles or whether it's through smoking at some people</v>

4174
02:01:37.201 --> 02:01:37.681
<v Speaker 3>freak out.</v>

4175
02:01:37.681 --> 02:01:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I've known people,</v>

4176
02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I've known of people</v>

4177
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>that have had real issues with it.</v>

4178
02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:42.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4179
02:01:42.171 --> 02:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>had a comedian here are a couple of weeks ago,</v>

4180
02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>talked about he doesn't smoke pot.</v>

4181
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:46.251
<v Speaker 1>He's from Brazil.</v>

4182
02:01:46.251 --> 02:01:47.084
<v Speaker 1>He smoked pot,</v>

4183
02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>use a vape pen,</v>

4184
02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4185
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>took a bunch of hits and was fucked up for two weeks.</v>

4186
02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

4187
02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>there are dangers and problems,</v>

4188
02:01:54.770 --> 02:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>certain pizza.</v>

4189
02:01:55.410 --> 02:01:56.151
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>

4190
02:01:56.151 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>The case for legalizing cannabis is not that there is no harm associated with</v>

4191
02:01:59.181 --> 02:01:59.631
<v Speaker 1>cannabis.</v>

4192
02:01:59.631 --> 02:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4193
02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>In the same way the case for legalizing alcohol is not,</v>

4194
02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:02.901
<v Speaker 1>there's no homeless.</v>

4195
02:02:02.901 --> 02:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4196
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>this is what Alex Bernstein is trying to go over in his book.</v>

4197
02:02:06.501 --> 02:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did a good job for two reasons.</v>

4198
02:02:08.691 --> 02:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

4199
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>because he's basically only making the case for it to be negative and I think</v>

4200
02:02:15.201 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>there's far more evidence that cannabis has had a positive influence on people.</v>

4201
02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>It reinforces community,</v>

4202
02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>it makes people more sensitive and kind.</v>

4203
02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>This a thought of paranoia might actually,</v>

4204
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>it makes people more humble.</v>

4205
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4206
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>it makes sex feel better and fix food tastes better.</v>

4207
02:02:32.001 --> 02:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4208
02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>there's creativity aspects to it that are undeniable.</v>

4209
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of very positive aspects to it.</v>

4210
02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>For some people it's not good,</v>

4211
02:02:39.171 --> 02:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's like saying,</v>

4212
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:41.203
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4213
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>some people die when the peanuts let's outlaw peanuts.</v>

4214
02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of your children about peanuts.</v>

4215
02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4216
02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I think everything you just said is,</v>

4217
02:02:49.290 --> 02:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely right.</v>

4218
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I think there's another layer that's going on at the same time,</v>

4219
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>a kind of below that which is really important people to understand.</v>

4220
02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's this thing.</v>

4221
02:02:57.650 --> 02:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4222
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:59.390
<v Speaker 1>so very often people will say,</v>

4223
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

4224
02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you get kind of Republican politicians.</v>

4225
02:03:01.701 --> 02:03:01.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4226
02:03:01.831 --> 02:03:03.590
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm a colleague Thena Rena saying it during,</v>

4227
02:03:03.591 --> 02:03:05.630
<v Speaker 1>when the Republican debates in 2016,</v>

4228
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:06.733
<v Speaker 1>2015 maybe,</v>

4229
02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:07.963
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4230
02:03:08.090 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 1>we can't legalize cannabis because it's much stronger now than it used to be.</v>

4231
02:03:11.190 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 1>THC content is coming up,</v>

4232
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:13.220
<v Speaker 1>people smoking skunk.</v>

4233
02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:15.320
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to understand why that happened.</v>

4234
02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It's because of drug prohibition.</v>

4235
02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:21.170
<v Speaker 1>So the day before alcohol was banned in the u s the most popular drinks by far</v>

4236
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:22.004
<v Speaker 1>were beer and wine.</v>

4237
02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:22.983
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4238
02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>In the weeks after alcohol prohibition ended most popular drinks again,</v>

4239
02:03:27.351 --> 02:03:30.050
<v Speaker 1>where beer and wine as they are today in between,</v>

4240
02:03:30.051 --> 02:03:32.060
<v Speaker 1>you could not get hold of bear unwind the most popular drinks,</v>

4241
02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:33.770
<v Speaker 1>whiskey and Moonshine UNICA.</v>

4242
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:34.071
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

4243
02:03:34.071 --> 02:03:34.904
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

4244
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:36.763
<v Speaker 1>why would that be?</v>

4245
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:37.603
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

4246
02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's because of a kind of slightly wonky and boring thing,</v>

4247
02:03:41.241 --> 02:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's worth talking about is called the Iron Law of prohibition.</v>

4248
02:03:44.391 --> 02:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine if we had to smuggle the nearest bar to hit,</v>

4249
02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.190
<v Speaker 1>if we had to smuggle all the alcohol for that bar in a wagon from the Canadian</v>

4250
02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:52.380
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>

4251
02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.211
<v Speaker 1>from the Mexican border,</v>

4252
02:03:53.211 --> 02:03:54.080
<v Speaker 1>right from Tijuana</v>

4253
02:03:55.730 --> 02:03:56.330
<v Speaker 1>in a wagon,</v>

4254
02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:57.440
<v Speaker 1>we fill our wagon with bear,</v>

4255
02:03:57.441 --> 02:03:59.180
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get drink for 400 people.</v>

4256
02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.210
<v Speaker 1>If we fill it with vogue cover,</v>

4257
02:04:00.211 --> 02:04:01.730
<v Speaker 1>get drink for thousands of people,</v>

4258
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:02.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4259
02:04:02.630 --> 02:04:05.780
<v Speaker 1>So when you find a drug and it has to be smuggled around,</v>

4260
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you get a premium on getting the biggest possible kick into the smallest</v>

4261
02:04:09.531 --> 02:04:10.340
<v Speaker 1>possible space,</v>

4262
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:10.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4263
02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:14.930
<v Speaker 1>This is why mild forms of the drug disappear before opiates were banned in the</v>

4264
02:04:14.931 --> 02:04:15.764
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

4265
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Most popular way of consuming it was something called Mrs Winslow sue things</v>

4266
02:04:19.001 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Syrup,</v>

4267
02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:20.810
<v Speaker 1>which you would buy in the pharmacy,</v>

4268
02:04:20.811 --> 02:04:20.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4269
02:04:20.991 --> 02:04:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Very low level of opiates.</v>

4270
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Most popular way of consuming cocoa based products prior to the banning was Coca</v>

4271
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Cola,</v>

4272
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4273
02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It's called that for a reason.</v>

4274
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4275
02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:30.740
<v Speaker 1>when the ban happens,</v>

4276
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>heroin becomes something from opiates.</v>

4277
02:04:32.091 --> 02:04:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Powder cocaine becomes the only form of cocaine.</v>

4278
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:34.731
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4279
02:04:34.731 --> 02:04:39.120
<v Speaker 1>when there's a huge crackdown on powder cocaine in the 80s the iron law kicks in</v>

4280
02:04:39.121 --> 02:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>even more and that's when crack is invented because you can get even more of a</v>

4281
02:04:41.521 --> 02:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>hair into an even smaller possible space.</v>

4282
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4283
02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>So I think he's important.</v>

4284
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Understand if you want,</v>

4285
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it is not good.</v>

4286
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Most people who drink alcohol don't want to drink vodka and they certainly don't</v>

4287
02:04:53.041 --> 02:04:54.570
<v Speaker 1>want drink absinthe most of the time.</v>

4288
02:04:54.571 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4289
02:04:55.050 --> 02:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Most people want a mild form of their drug.</v>

4290
02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:57.871
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4291
02:04:57.871 --> 02:04:58.351
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis.</v>

4292
02:04:58.351 --> 02:04:58.621
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4293
02:04:58.621 --> 02:04:58.831
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

4294
02:04:58.831 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 1>there's some people who want to get totally fucked up either for fun or because</v>

4295
02:05:01.831 --> 02:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>they have addiction problems.</v>

4296
02:05:02.530 --> 02:05:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Most people want a mild form of the drug is not good that malforms or the drug</v>

4297
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:07.163
<v Speaker 1>when they're not.</v>

4298
02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>

4299
02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not true.</v>

4300
02:05:09.571 --> 02:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>

4301
02:05:10.530 --> 02:05:11.311
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>

4302
02:05:11.311 --> 02:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>what happened was medical care cannabis got passed and once medical cannabis got</v>

4303
02:05:15.211 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>passed,</v>

4304
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:20.930
<v Speaker 1>there was a an emphasis on the strongest possible stuff because people wanted</v>

4305
02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:22.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4306
02:05:22.410 --> 02:05:22.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4307
02:05:22.651 --> 02:05:26.340
<v Speaker 1>it was a direct result of people having higher tolerances because marijuana was</v>

4308
02:05:26.341 --> 02:05:27.960
<v Speaker 1>so readily available and they,</v>

4309
02:05:27.961 --> 02:05:30.660
<v Speaker 1>if you have a high tolerance and you smoke a lot of pot,</v>

4310
02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you want strong pot because week pot doesn't do anything.</v>

4311
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's the number one complaint amongst cannabis enthusiasts is someone having</v>

4312
02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 1>week pops.</v>

4313
02:05:40.051 --> 02:05:42.780
<v Speaker 1>You've got a subculture of people who are cannabis enthusiasts.</v>

4314
02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Who do you write?</v>

4315
02:05:44.551 --> 02:05:44.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a sub.</v>

4316
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Just like there's a subculture of people who want Volcker App south.</v>

4317
02:05:47.271 --> 02:05:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

4318
02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:47.761
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4319
02:05:47.761 --> 02:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's a matter.</v>

4320
02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

4321
02:05:50.401 --> 02:05:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Like gender obviously is more potent than whiskey or then beer rather.</v>

4322
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.590
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to carry gen around.</v>

4323
02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to carry less of it.</v>

4324
02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:57.991
<v Speaker 1>With cannabis,</v>

4325
02:05:57.991 --> 02:06:00.030
<v Speaker 1>people are still buying the same quantity.</v>

4326
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:04.860
<v Speaker 1>They're just getting more fucked up because their tolerances are so much higher.</v>

4327
02:06:04.861 --> 02:06:06.870
<v Speaker 1>They need a stronger and stronger THC.</v>

4328
02:06:06.871 --> 02:06:08.580
<v Speaker 1>So as you have a legal market,</v>

4329
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you can have a variety of options.</v>

4330
02:06:11.210 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>What you have is what,</v>

4331
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 1>what we'll discover.</v>

4332
02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I think as time goes by,</v>

4333
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:17.310
<v Speaker 1>because we know with alcohol is different.</v>

4334
02:06:17.311 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 1>People want cannabis to do different things.</v>

4335
02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:19.531
<v Speaker 1>You're totally right.</v>

4336
02:06:19.531 --> 02:06:22.320
<v Speaker 1>There's some people who want maximum THC maximally fucked up.</v>

4337
02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Some people where there's still a market for for lower grade we'd,</v>

4338
02:06:26.221 --> 02:06:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have it listed at all these dispensaries.</v>

4339
02:06:29.610 --> 02:06:30.421
<v Speaker 1>They have it listed,</v>

4340
02:06:30.421 --> 02:06:30.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4341
02:06:30.691 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 1>20% 35% they have it listed.</v>

4342
02:06:33.241 --> 02:06:36.270
<v Speaker 1>So you can choose a more mild marijuana if you like to,</v>

4343
02:06:36.271 --> 02:06:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but the gee people,</v>

4344
02:06:37.381 --> 02:06:38.910
<v Speaker 1>the people that do it every day,</v>

4345
02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:40.830
<v Speaker 1>of course they want that really potent weed.</v>

4346
02:06:40.831 --> 02:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I would say they're more like the people in Vegas who gamble a</v>

4347
02:06:45.231 --> 02:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>professional gamblers versus the people who go to Vegas for the weekend and just</v>

4348
02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:49.710
<v Speaker 1>want to play a real well.</v>

4349
02:06:49.890 --> 02:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a concentrated market of very dedicated users who want to get</v>

4350
02:06:54.001 --> 02:06:54.900
<v Speaker 1>maximally fucked up.</v>

4351
02:06:54.901 --> 02:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>You're totally right now.</v>

4352
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what pushed the Po.</v>

4353
02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's also in botanists and I'm friends with a bunch of people who breed</v>

4354
02:07:01.501 --> 02:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and grow these various strains.</v>

4355
02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:04.503
<v Speaker 1>If you think about,</v>

4356
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:07.950
<v Speaker 1>so professor David [inaudible] has done really interesting work on this.</v>

4357
02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:09.151
<v Speaker 1>If I remember rightly,</v>

4358
02:07:09.151 --> 02:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>there's 38 active components in cannabis,</v>

4359
02:07:11.401 --> 02:07:11.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4360
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So cannabinoids,</v>

4361
02:07:13.011 --> 02:07:14.520
<v Speaker 1>so there's hundreds of cannabinoids.</v>

4362
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

4363
02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:16.410
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>

4364
02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:17.243
<v Speaker 1>if from press and elsewhere,</v>

4365
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:17.831
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4366
02:07:17.831 --> 02:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>he'll gives this kind of significant active components.</v>

4367
02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.051
<v Speaker 1>Maybe other people.</v>

4368
02:07:22.051 --> 02:07:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4369
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I think there's over a hundred,</v>

4370
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4371
02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:25.680
<v Speaker 1>canabinoids I think we just discussed this,</v>

4372
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:25.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4373
02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4374
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:26.311
<v Speaker 1>Then we,</v>

4375
02:07:26.311 --> 02:07:26.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4376
02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:30.090
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things he Auggie's and I'm happy to be corrected on the specific</v>

4377
02:07:30.091 --> 02:07:30.301
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

4378
02:07:30.301 --> 02:07:31.190
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he,</v>

4379
02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:33.300
<v Speaker 1>he Auggie's um,</v>

4380
02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>is you've got it,</v>

4381
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>cause you're talking about schizophrenia</v>

4382
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:36.821
<v Speaker 4>and psychosis.</v>

4383
02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:40.750
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important to understand there is some evidence that very high</v>

4384
02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:44.230
<v Speaker 4>exposure to THC in a small number of people can,</v>

4385
02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 4>can lead to psychosis.</v>

4386
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:46.450
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4387
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:49.090
<v Speaker 4>And that's even a small number of people where you have a very widely used drug</v>

4388
02:07:49.091 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

4389
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:50.440
<v Speaker 4>is that's really problematic.</v>

4390
02:07:50.441 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4391
02:07:51.010 --> 02:07:53.380
<v Speaker 4>But actually this was range the evidence.</v>

4392
02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:58.560
<v Speaker 4>So why do people who are prone to psychosis or schizophrenia want cannabis?</v>

4393
02:07:59.111 --> 02:07:59.351
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4394
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:00.790
<v Speaker 4>Cause there is a lot of them who want it.</v>

4395
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:01.953
<v Speaker 4>It's not the people,</v>

4396
02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:04.540
<v Speaker 4>hardly anyone wants to have a psychotic episode.</v>

4397
02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 4>It's actually so THC,</v>

4398
02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:08.253
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4399
02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:09.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4400
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:09.850
<v Speaker 4>correlates with,</v>

4401
02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:11.170
<v Speaker 4>with psychosis in some people.</v>

4402
02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:12.910
<v Speaker 4>But there's another component,</v>

4403
02:08:12.911 --> 02:08:14.410
<v Speaker 4>cannabis called CBD,</v>

4404
02:08:15.370 --> 02:08:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Cannabidiol,</v>

4405
02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:19.150
<v Speaker 4>which actually we know there's good evidence soothes the psychosis and</v>

4406
02:08:19.151 --> 02:08:19.841
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia,</v>

4407
02:08:19.841 --> 02:08:20.051
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4408
02:08:20.051 --> 02:08:23.800
<v Speaker 4>It's actually given us a treatment in some places in distilled pill form.</v>

4409
02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:28.420
<v Speaker 4>So actually it's a slightly more complex picture then cannabis causes psychosis,</v>

4410
02:08:28.421 --> 02:08:29.254
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4411
02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:32.500
<v Speaker 4>Very rich THC in some people will cause psychosis.</v>

4412
02:08:32.501 --> 02:08:33.550
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>

4413
02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:36.010
<v Speaker 4>There are things we can do to prevent that.</v>

4414
02:08:36.011 --> 02:08:39.280
<v Speaker 4>And one of the good things about legal market is you can regulate it.</v>

4415
02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.920
<v Speaker 4>So we can limit the amount of THC that is available.</v>

4416
02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Just like we can limit,</v>

4417
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:45.510
<v Speaker 4>you can't go and buy 70% proof alcohol,</v>

4418
02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:46.790
<v Speaker 4>but also what,</v>

4419
02:08:46.791 --> 02:08:46.940
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

4420
02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:49.000
<v Speaker 4>what professor not has been arguing is we need to be,</v>

4421
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:50.260
<v Speaker 4>and they exist,</v>

4422
02:08:50.261 --> 02:08:53.170
<v Speaker 4>but they need to be commercialized and promoted more,</v>

4423
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:54.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4424
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 4>or promoting public health way and not necessarily commercially,</v>

4425
02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:58.093
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4426
02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:01.580
<v Speaker 4>CBD rich cannabis will actually be helpful to people with psychosis and</v>

4427
02:09:01.581 --> 02:09:02.260
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia.</v>

4428
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:03.690
<v Speaker 4>It's just a slightly more complicated picture.</v>

4429
02:09:03.691 --> 02:09:04.130
<v Speaker 4>I know that you,</v>

4430
02:09:04.130 --> 02:09:04.580
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4431
02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:06.600
<v Speaker 4>you're not saying that it is,</v>

4432
02:09:06.730 --> 02:09:08.550
<v Speaker 4>you're not endorsing what the,</v>

4433
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:09.221
<v Speaker 4>tell your kids got.</v>

4434
02:09:09.221 --> 02:09:09.950
<v Speaker 4>What's it called again?</v>

4435
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm the guy who did your debate.</v>

4436
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:12.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4437
02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:13.310
<v Speaker 4>our experienced,</v>

4438
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:14.143
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4439
02:09:14.290 --> 02:09:17.350
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not endorsing the kind of simplistic view on either side,</v>

4440
02:09:17.351 --> 02:09:18.184
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

4441
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:18.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4442
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:19.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4443
02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:20.470
<v Speaker 4>I think it's slightly more,</v>

4444
02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:21.910
<v Speaker 4>slightly more complicated than that.</v>

4445
02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:23.830
<v Speaker 4>The other thing I think is really worth saying though to people is,</v>

4446
02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:26.320
<v Speaker 4>there's one thing we will do agree on,</v>

4447
02:09:26.321 --> 02:09:29.230
<v Speaker 4>which is cannabis is bad for young teenagers,</v>

4448
02:09:29.231 --> 02:09:29.501
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4449
02:09:29.501 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 4>It's after developing brains.</v>

4450
02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.070
<v Speaker 4>There's one person that interview to really helped me to,</v>

4451
02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:33.341
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4452
02:09:33.341 --> 02:09:35.620
<v Speaker 4>to think about this guy called Fred Martins,</v>

4453
02:09:35.890 --> 02:09:36.371
<v Speaker 4>who's in,</v>

4454
02:09:36.371 --> 02:09:37.570
<v Speaker 4>I went to go see him in Camden,</v>

4455
02:09:37.571 --> 02:09:38.404
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey,</v>

4456
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:39.581
<v Speaker 4>and Fred was a co,</v>

4457
02:09:39.581 --> 02:09:40.211
<v Speaker 4>he's retired now,</v>

4458
02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:41.044
<v Speaker 4>but he was a cop.</v>

4459
02:09:41.370 --> 02:09:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I was really kind of right when it reminded me of the clinics were character and</v>

4460
02:09:44.141 --> 02:09:44.681
<v Speaker 4>dirty Harry.</v>

4461
02:09:44.681 --> 02:09:45.311
<v Speaker 4>He's not a liberal.</v>

4462
02:09:45.311 --> 02:09:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4463
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.620
<v Speaker 4>And he had this,</v>

4464
02:09:47.621 --> 02:09:48.790
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't use a fancy word like this,</v>

4465
02:09:48.791 --> 02:09:51.370
<v Speaker 4>but he had an epiphany about drug legalization.</v>

4466
02:09:51.371 --> 02:09:53.670
<v Speaker 4>One day he was at a car park in Wayne,</v>

4467
02:09:53.671 --> 02:09:58.671
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey in 1971 it was staking out a dealer and he's in plain clothes</v>

4468
02:09:59.261 --> 02:09:59.681
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

4469
02:09:59.681 --> 02:10:02.530
<v Speaker 4>And a kid comes up to him like an 11 year old or something and it goes,</v>

4470
02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:02.891
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4471
02:10:02.891 --> 02:10:03.724
<v Speaker 4>Mr.</v>

4472
02:10:04.150 --> 02:10:04.983
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4473
02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not allowed to buy alcohol where you go in to that liquor store and buy some</v>

4474
02:10:07.841 --> 02:10:08.674
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>

4475
02:10:09.190 --> 02:10:09.671
<v Speaker 4>And frank goes,</v>

4476
02:10:09.671 --> 02:10:09.821
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4477
02:10:09.821 --> 02:10:10.654
<v Speaker 4>get outta here.</v>

4478
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:14.170
<v Speaker 4>So the kid walks over to the drug dealer and buy some drugs from him instead.</v>

4479
02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.330
<v Speaker 4>And Fred has this kind of realization,</v>

4480
02:10:16.331 --> 02:10:17.050
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

4481
02:10:17.050 --> 02:10:17.830
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4482
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:18.790
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't put it this way,</v>

4483
02:10:18.791 --> 02:10:22.750
<v Speaker 4>but legalization puts a regulatory barrier between kids and drugs that doesn't</v>

4484
02:10:22.751 --> 02:10:23.590
<v Speaker 4>currently exist.</v>

4485
02:10:23.591 --> 02:10:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4486
02:10:24.130 --> 02:10:26.560
<v Speaker 4>This is why since they legalized cannabis in Colorado,</v>

4487
02:10:26.561 --> 02:10:27.280
<v Speaker 4>there's been this,</v>

4488
02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:28.031
<v Speaker 4>don't overstate it.</v>

4489
02:10:28.031 --> 02:10:28.511
<v Speaker 4>It's not huge,</v>

4490
02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:31.140
<v Speaker 4>but there's been a significant fall in teenage cannabis,</v>

4491
02:10:31.210 --> 02:10:31.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4492
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Drug dealers don't check ID licensed legal businesses.</v>

4493
02:10:34.971 --> 02:10:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Do they really care if they're there because they've got something to lose?</v>

4494
02:10:38.091 --> 02:10:38.924
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4495
02:10:39.110 --> 02:10:43.220
<v Speaker 4>So I think if sometimes it's used as that kind of protect our kids argument is</v>

4496
02:10:43.221 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 4>used as a case for prohibition.</v>

4497
02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:45.523
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

4498
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.790
<v Speaker 4>if you want to protect your kids,</v>

4499
02:10:46.791 --> 02:10:50.300
<v Speaker 4>you should be putting a big premium on getting these substances out of the hands</v>

4500
02:10:50.301 --> 02:10:54.770
<v Speaker 4>of armed criminal gangs and into the hands of licensed legal businesses.</v>

4501
02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:55.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4502
02:10:55.541 --> 02:10:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody's going to argue that.</v>

4503
02:10:57.190 --> 02:10:59.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that anybody rational rather,</v>

4504
02:10:59.730 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4505
02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that makes a lot of sense.</v>

4506
02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

4507
02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:02.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4508
02:11:02.770 --> 02:11:03.220
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4509
02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:07.780
<v Speaker 3>the number of people that have schizophrenia is fairly,</v>

4510
02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:12.730
<v Speaker 3>it's fairly stable in terms of the percentage of it across the board,</v>

4511
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:15.220
<v Speaker 3>cannabis users or non cannabis users.</v>

4512
02:11:15.221 --> 02:11:19.060
<v Speaker 3>And so the argument against this idea that cannabis causes a schizo frantic</v>

4513
02:11:19.061 --> 02:11:22.690
<v Speaker 3>breaks is that these people already have schizophrenia and it just hasn't really</v>

4514
02:11:22.691 --> 02:11:24.150
<v Speaker 3>manifested itself in a,</v>

4515
02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:25.510
<v Speaker 3>in a tangible sense.</v>

4516
02:11:25.570 --> 02:11:27.220
<v Speaker 4>So this is one of the things professor nuts says.</v>

4517
02:11:27.221 --> 02:11:27.950
<v Speaker 4>So there's this,</v>

4518
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:31.960
<v Speaker 4>there is some evidence that cannabis in a small number of people causes</v>

4519
02:11:31.961 --> 02:11:34.900
<v Speaker 4>psychosis as a study in Sweden that showed this with schizophrenia,</v>

4520
02:11:34.901 --> 02:11:35.980
<v Speaker 4>it's much more contested.</v>

4521
02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:36.893
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4522
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:39.000
<v Speaker 3>so psychosis versus schizophrenia.</v>

4523
02:11:39.150 --> 02:11:41.220
<v Speaker 3>What is the major distinction?</v>

4524
02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:42.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4525
02:11:42.281 --> 02:11:43.480
<v Speaker 4>I have not researched this in depth,</v>

4526
02:11:43.481 --> 02:11:44.314
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

4527
02:11:44.770 --> 02:11:46.030
<v Speaker 4>psychosis involves,</v>

4528
02:11:46.570 --> 02:11:47.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4529
02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:48.320
<v Speaker 4>is that the different,</v>

4530
02:11:48.810 --> 02:11:50.010
<v Speaker 4>the different paranoia.</v>

4531
02:11:50.110 --> 02:11:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Schizophrenia is a subset of mental illness is very specific,</v>

4532
02:11:53.230 --> 02:11:55.000
<v Speaker 4>has a significant genetic component,</v>

4533
02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:57.460
<v Speaker 4>although there can be environmental triggers for it.</v>

4534
02:11:57.490 --> 02:11:58.990
<v Speaker 4>So it could possibly trigger both.</v>

4535
02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:02.590
<v Speaker 4>It could possibly trigger psychosis and schizophrenia argument against the APP.</v>

4536
02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:03.220
<v Speaker 4>So professor.</v>

4537
02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:04.840
<v Speaker 4>So there is evidence with psychosis,</v>

4538
02:12:04.841 --> 02:12:06.220
<v Speaker 4>the argument when a stress,</v>

4539
02:12:06.221 --> 02:12:07.390
<v Speaker 4>it's a very small number of people,</v>

4540
02:12:07.391 --> 02:12:08.224
<v Speaker 4>but it Israel,</v>

4541
02:12:08.530 --> 02:12:09.363
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4542
02:12:09.490 --> 02:12:09.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4543
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 4>and there are things we can do in a legal market to counteract that,</v>

4544
02:12:12.351 --> 02:12:14.140
<v Speaker 4>that are much harder to do in a prohibited market.</v>

4545
02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:15.490
<v Speaker 4>But with schizophrenia,</v>

4546
02:12:15.491 --> 02:12:16.271
<v Speaker 4>the argument against it,</v>

4547
02:12:16.271 --> 02:12:18.160
<v Speaker 4>and I've not looked into this and a huge amount of detail,</v>

4548
02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.113
<v Speaker 4>so I don't want to,</v>

4549
02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.330
<v Speaker 4>this is not the same degree of confidence I've been saying the other stuff,</v>

4550
02:12:22.331 --> 02:12:22.590
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4551
02:12:22.590 --> 02:12:23.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4552
02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:24.430
<v Speaker 4>professor not argues,</v>

4553
02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:25.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4554
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:28.960
<v Speaker 4>we know that cannabis use has massively increased in Britain,</v>

4555
02:12:28.961 --> 02:12:29.591
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

4556
02:12:29.591 --> 02:12:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I think something like 20 fold increase since 1916 Britain and yet levels of</v>

4557
02:12:33.581 --> 02:12:34.870
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia have remained the same.</v>

4558
02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.210
<v Speaker 4>If cannabis was causing schizophrenia,</v>

4559
02:12:37.211 --> 02:12:41.140
<v Speaker 4>you would expect it to vary with cannabis use,</v>

4560
02:12:41.141 --> 02:12:41.951
<v Speaker 4>at least to some degree,</v>

4561
02:12:41.951 --> 02:12:42.940
<v Speaker 4>there'd be some relationship.</v>

4562
02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:44.530
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't seem to be the case.</v>

4563
02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:45.191
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

4564
02:12:45.191 --> 02:12:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4565
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.031
<v Speaker 4>that's what professor,</v>

4566
02:12:46.031 --> 02:12:46.271
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

4567
02:12:46.271 --> 02:12:49.270
<v Speaker 4>who's the former chief scientific advisor on drugs in Britain says,</v>

4568
02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:50.650
<v Speaker 4>I haven't looked into that in great detail.</v>

4569
02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:52.990
<v Speaker 4>So He's basically right.</v>

4570
02:12:52.991 --> 02:12:55.090
<v Speaker 4>And all the things that I have looked into that he says,</v>

4571
02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:56.430
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

4572
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:57.263
<v Speaker 4>mmm,</v>

4573
02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:02.220
<v Speaker 3>do they know what the mechanism would be that would cause someone to consume THC</v>

4574
02:13:02.221 --> 02:13:03.900
<v Speaker 3>and have a psychotic break?</v>

4575
02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:05.011
<v Speaker 3>Have that,</v>

4576
02:13:05.011 --> 02:13:05.930
<v Speaker 3>does that have been examined?</v>

4577
02:13:05.931 --> 02:13:06.571
<v Speaker 3>I don't enough about it.</v>

4578
02:13:06.571 --> 02:13:07.800
<v Speaker 3>That would seem to be a big issue.</v>

4579
02:13:07.801 --> 02:13:08.071
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4580
02:13:08.071 --> 02:13:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Like find out what it is that's causing this trigger and whether or not this</v>

4581
02:13:12.471 --> 02:13:13.770
<v Speaker 3>exists in these people anyway,</v>

4582
02:13:13.771 --> 02:13:17.760
<v Speaker 3>and maybe a stressful situation and a bad breakup losing their job.</v>

4583
02:13:17.761 --> 02:13:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one of those things could also,</v>

4584
02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:19.580
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

4585
02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Well we know with all mental health,</v>

4586
02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:26.030
<v Speaker 4>all aspects of mental health or mental health problems,</v>

4587
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:28.430
<v Speaker 4>there were three kinds of calls,</v>

4588
02:13:28.431 --> 02:13:29.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4589
02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:29.993
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>

4590
02:13:30.130 --> 02:13:31.130
<v Speaker 4>my bit lost connections,</v>

4591
02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:31.711
<v Speaker 4>which about depression,</v>

4592
02:13:31.711 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 4>anxieties,</v>

4593
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.023
<v Speaker 4>a lot about this.</v>

4594
02:13:33.210 --> 02:13:34.710
<v Speaker 4>There are biological causes,</v>

4595
02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:36.660
<v Speaker 4>things like your jeans,</v>

4596
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:37.710
<v Speaker 4>real brain changes,</v>

4597
02:13:37.890 --> 02:13:39.390
<v Speaker 4>things like the introduction of a drug.</v>

4598
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:43.470
<v Speaker 4>There are psychological causes to how you think about yourself and your place in</v>

4599
02:13:43.471 --> 02:13:43.741
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

4600
02:13:43.741 --> 02:13:45.180
<v Speaker 4>And then there's environmental causes.</v>

4601
02:13:45.181 --> 02:13:45.511
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4602
02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:46.344
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4603
02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.520
<v Speaker 4>how we live with each other,</v>

4604
02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:48.480
<v Speaker 4>things like loneliness,</v>

4605
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:49.343
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>

4606
02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4607
02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:53.310
<v Speaker 4>and in all mental health phenomena to some degree,</v>

4608
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 4>these three sets of courses player.</v>

4609
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:56.520
<v Speaker 4>So let's think about even something very,</v>

4610
02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4611
02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:58.133
<v Speaker 4>dementia.</v>

4612
02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Dementia as a very obviously has a heavy biological driver,</v>

4613
02:14:02.221 --> 02:14:02.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4614
02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Dementia is a physical degeneration of the brain or a disease like Alzheimer's.</v>

4615
02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:07.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4616
02:14:07.290 --> 02:14:08.610
<v Speaker 4>but even with dementia,</v>

4617
02:14:08.611 --> 02:14:10.890
<v Speaker 4>which has this very heavy biological driver,</v>

4618
02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:14.280
<v Speaker 4>we know there are big social and psychological effects that can mitigate it.</v>

4619
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.640
<v Speaker 4>So if you're part of a strong community and have lots of social connections,</v>

4620
02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:19.230
<v Speaker 4>if you have a positive self image,</v>

4621
02:14:19.231 --> 02:14:20.550
<v Speaker 4>if you speak other languages,</v>

4622
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:23.490
<v Speaker 4>you're dementia will develop significantly more slowly than if you don't have</v>

4623
02:14:23.491 --> 02:14:24.570
<v Speaker 4>any of these factors,</v>

4624
02:14:24.571 --> 02:14:25.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4625
02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.970
<v Speaker 4>So with things like psychosis,</v>

4626
02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:29.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a brilliant person called Tanya Lurman,</v>

4627
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Professor Daniel Lemon at Stanford University who's done really interesting,</v>

4628
02:14:33.650 --> 02:14:33.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4629
02:14:33.930 --> 02:14:35.430
<v Speaker 4>research and sandwich and to in great detail,</v>

4630
02:14:35.431 --> 02:14:36.264
<v Speaker 4>but I interviewed her,</v>

4631
02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:37.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4632
02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:37.730
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

4633
02:14:37.730 --> 02:14:38.031
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

4634
02:14:38.031 --> 02:14:38.760
<v Speaker 4>who shown.</v>

4635
02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:43.760
<v Speaker 4>So we know recovery from psychosis or schizophrenia is much stronger in African</v>

4636
02:14:44.221 --> 02:14:46.170
<v Speaker 4>countries than it is in the United States.</v>

4637
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4638
02:14:46.770 --> 02:14:49.980
<v Speaker 4>And it's not a genetic thing because Africans who come to the United States end</v>

4639
02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:51.960
<v Speaker 4>up having the American level of recovery,</v>

4640
02:14:51.970 --> 02:14:53.400
<v Speaker 4>not the African level of recovery.</v>

4641
02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:54.940
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

4642
02:14:54.941 --> 02:14:55.261
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4643
02:14:55.261 --> 02:14:57.840
<v Speaker 4>it's a while since I spoke [inaudible] I don't want to overstate my confidence</v>

4644
02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:58.171
<v Speaker 4>about this,</v>

4645
02:14:58.171 --> 02:14:59.010
<v Speaker 4>but there are other people,</v>

4646
02:14:59.011 --> 02:15:00.330
<v Speaker 4>there are people I think including her,</v>

4647
02:15:00.690 --> 02:15:01.980
<v Speaker 4>who argue in part.</v>

4648
02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:04.470
<v Speaker 4>What's going on is in many,</v>

4649
02:15:04.530 --> 02:15:05.041
<v Speaker 4>not all.</v>

4650
02:15:05.041 --> 02:15:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Some places it's really brutal,</v>

4651
02:15:06.241 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 4>but in many parts of Africa,</v>

4652
02:15:07.590 --> 02:15:09.270
<v Speaker 4>you remain part of the community.</v>

4653
02:15:09.271 --> 02:15:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Even if you have these mental health problems,</v>

4654
02:15:10.951 --> 02:15:11.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4655
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:13.260
<v Speaker 4>They have much stronger social connections.</v>

4656
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:15.060
<v Speaker 4>It's a study that asks Americans,</v>

4657
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:18.510
<v Speaker 4>how many close friends do you have who you could turn to in a crisis?</v>

4658
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 4>And when they started doing it years ago,</v>

4659
02:15:20.161 --> 02:15:21.600
<v Speaker 4>the most common answer was five.</v>

4660
02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:22.351
<v Speaker 4>Today,</v>

4661
02:15:22.351 --> 02:15:23.790
<v Speaker 4>the most common answer is none,</v>

4662
02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:24.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4663
02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:25.501
<v Speaker 4>It's not the average,</v>

4664
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:26.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's most common answer.</v>

4665
02:15:27.210 --> 02:15:29.310
<v Speaker 4>Half of all Americans asked,</v>

4666
02:15:29.311 --> 02:15:30.420
<v Speaker 4>how many people know you?</v>

4667
02:15:30.421 --> 02:15:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Well say nobody,</v>

4668
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:33.143
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4669
02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:34.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge amount of evidence.</v>

4670
02:15:35.730 --> 02:15:38.640
<v Speaker 4>Loneliness is toxic for human beings.</v>

4671
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Lonely people as guided a to experiments on this.</v>

4672
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Here in La,</v>

4673
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:46.910
<v Speaker 4>lonely people exposed to the flu virus and the cold virus and the colds are way</v>

4674
02:15:48.391 --> 02:15:50.670
<v Speaker 4>more likely to actually get them the non lonely people.</v>

4675
02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4676
02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4677
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:55.080
<v Speaker 4>it's just devastating for your physical and mental health to be lonely.</v>

4678
02:15:55.081 --> 02:15:56.340
<v Speaker 4>There's other things going on.</v>

4679
02:15:56.610 --> 02:15:59.250
<v Speaker 4>So I think there's a whole range of things that are going on with all mental</v>

4680
02:15:59.251 --> 02:15:59.641
<v Speaker 4>health problems.</v>

4681
02:15:59.641 --> 02:16:01.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how this relates to cannabis and psychosis.</v>

4682
02:16:01.231 --> 02:16:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>

4683
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4684
02:16:02.610 --> 02:16:03.990
<v Speaker 4>But we know with psychosis,</v>

4685
02:16:04.230 --> 02:16:04.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4686
02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:04.740
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

4687
02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:06.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a big debate about this.</v>

4688
02:16:06.271 --> 02:16:07.620
<v Speaker 4>Immigrants are more likely to have psychosis.</v>

4689
02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 4>The nonimmigrant says there's a whole,</v>

4690
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4691
02:16:09.810 --> 02:16:11.520
<v Speaker 4>lots of environmental factors playing out,</v>

4692
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:12.930
<v Speaker 4>even in extreme mental health problems.</v>

4693
02:16:12.931 --> 02:16:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Like now I want to stress they're not the only thing.</v>

4694
02:16:15.091 --> 02:16:17.280
<v Speaker 4>There are real biological aspects as well,</v>

4695
02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:17.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4696
02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:21.750
<v Speaker 4>which are clearly very significant and things like schizophrenia and play some</v>

4697
02:16:21.751 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 4>role in things like depression for a lot of people.</v>

4698
02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:24.810
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4699
02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:25.470
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

4700
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:26.303
<v Speaker 4>so that makes sense.</v>

4701
02:16:29.130 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4702
02:16:29.710 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4703
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.700
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

4704
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4705
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:31.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4706
02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's varying biological factors,</v>

4707
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:35.920
<v Speaker 3>but the cultural factors make sense.</v>

4708
02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:38.290
<v Speaker 3>The fact that these people in Africa are not,</v>

4709
02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:40.450
<v Speaker 3>they're not expelled from the community,</v>

4710
02:16:40.570 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 3>so they have a sense of bond and maybe it's more easy to recover.</v>

4711
02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:46.420
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that you hear about,</v>

4712
02:16:46.810 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem with mental illness is that people with mental illness are</v>

4713
02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:51.491
<v Speaker 3>pushed away.</v>

4714
02:16:51.491 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>People don't want to deal with their problem and it exacerbates whatever is</v>

4715
02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:56.590
<v Speaker 3>causing it in the first place.</v>

4716
02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:58.510
<v Speaker 3>What drugs have you used?</v>

4717
02:16:58.590 --> 02:17:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Just have to be slightly Kaplan.</v>

4718
02:17:00.581 --> 02:17:01.031
<v Speaker 4>My answer,</v>

4719
02:17:01.031 --> 02:17:04.560
<v Speaker 4>because I'm in an immigration process a lot to me,</v>

4720
02:17:04.690 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 4>I got a prescription legal drugs,</v>

4721
02:17:06.850 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 4>so I used to drug illegally.</v>

4722
02:17:09.011 --> 02:17:13.150
<v Speaker 4>That is prescription drug is so called Modafinil or provigil.</v>

4723
02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Why did you use it illegally?</v>

4724
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:16.980
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty easy to get a prescription for nine Britain register.</v>

4725
02:17:17.010 --> 02:17:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Explain to people who don't know.</v>

4726
02:17:18.250 --> 02:17:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Pro Provigil is a drug that was developed.</v>

4727
02:17:19.871 --> 02:17:23.200
<v Speaker 4>People with narcolepsy was actually developed as a</v>

4728
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.250
<v Speaker 3>a performance enhancer and they just had to find a reason to use it the other</v>

4729
02:17:27.251 --> 02:17:27.551
<v Speaker 3>way round.</v>

4730
02:17:27.551 --> 02:17:28.090
<v Speaker 3>How interesting.</v>

4731
02:17:28.090 --> 02:17:29.710
<v Speaker 3>They had to find a reason to use it.</v>

4732
02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:31.900
<v Speaker 3>And the reason to use it was to say,</v>

4733
02:17:31.901 --> 02:17:32.111
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4734
02:17:32.111 --> 02:17:33.520
<v Speaker 3>let's give it to people with narcolepsy.</v>

4735
02:17:33.730 --> 02:17:34.563
<v Speaker 3>Let's do that.</v>

4736
02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Let's check to see if that's true,</v>

4737
02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:39.310
<v Speaker 3>because that's how it's been explained to me by actually by my doctor.</v>

4738
02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:39.761
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4739
02:17:39.761 --> 02:17:40.510
<v Speaker 4>that's really interesting.</v>

4740
02:17:40.510 --> 02:17:41.680
<v Speaker 4>I perfectly prepared to,</v>

4741
02:17:41.770 --> 02:17:43.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that,</v>

4742
02:17:43.001 --> 02:17:44.590
<v Speaker 4>but sounds plausible to me that,</v>

4743
02:17:45.130 --> 02:17:46.690
<v Speaker 4>so I think for me,</v>

4744
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:48.400
<v Speaker 4>do you use that a lot?</v>

4745
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:49.001
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4746
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:50.350
<v Speaker 4>So is it now,</v>

4747
02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:51.670
<v Speaker 4>so for me,</v>

4748
02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4749
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I think I did have an addiction to that.</v>

4750
02:17:54.370 --> 02:17:55.151
<v Speaker 4>What had addiction to,</v>

4751
02:17:55.151 --> 02:17:56.140
<v Speaker 4>was working all the time.</v>

4752
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:58.240
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in a</v>

4753
02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:04.090
<v Speaker 4>crazy and violent environment in many ways and my way of where there's addiction</v>

4754
02:18:04.091 --> 02:18:07.780
<v Speaker 4>and other things and my way of coping in that environment was to read and write</v>

4755
02:18:07.781 --> 02:18:12.610
<v Speaker 4>all the time to just not be present by just working right in front of a small</v>

4756
02:18:12.611 --> 02:18:13.444
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>

4757
02:18:13.770 --> 02:18:15.010
<v Speaker 4>And as I got older,</v>

4758
02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:15.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4759
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:17.860
<v Speaker 4>that was really my way of being in the world,</v>

4760
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:18.101
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4761
02:18:18.101 --> 02:18:19.360
<v Speaker 4>To work all the time.</v>

4762
02:18:19.810 --> 02:18:20.643
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4763
02:18:20.770 --> 02:18:21.820
<v Speaker 4>and I think when I got into my,</v>

4764
02:18:21.821 --> 02:18:23.740
<v Speaker 4>like late twenties,</v>

4765
02:18:23.741 --> 02:18:24.340
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember,</v>

4766
02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:25.750
<v Speaker 4>I wrote an article about Modafinil so it could,</v>

4767
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:26.470
<v Speaker 4>I could find,</v>

4768
02:18:26.470 --> 02:18:27.550
<v Speaker 4>figure out when I started taking it.</v>

4769
02:18:27.551 --> 02:18:28.384
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

4770
02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:30.610
<v Speaker 4>cause I initially wrote a very positive article about it.</v>

4771
02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:32.313
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4772
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:37.000
<v Speaker 4>I was at that point where the obsessive and compulsive work wasn't working for</v>

4773
02:18:37.001 --> 02:18:37.570
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

4774
02:18:37.570 --> 02:18:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4775
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:42.340
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't an like a lot of people with addictive behavior.</v>

4776
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I was doubling down on the thing that wasn't working that well.</v>

4777
02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:47.920
<v Speaker 4>So for me,</v>

4778
02:18:47.921 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 4>Modafinil was,</v>

4779
02:18:48.971 --> 02:18:51.100
<v Speaker 4>or provigil I bought it on the Internet.</v>

4780
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:52.413
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4781
02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:59.350
<v Speaker 4>was a way I thought initially and make it so I could work even more hours to be</v>

4782
02:18:59.351 --> 02:19:00.220
<v Speaker 4>even more right.</v>

4783
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:02.020
<v Speaker 4>And initially when you start taking it,</v>

4784
02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.510
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people take it before exams for example.</v>

4785
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4786
02:19:05.650 --> 02:19:06.820
<v Speaker 4>it does make you feel,</v>

4787
02:19:06.821 --> 02:19:08.110
<v Speaker 4>it's not a caffeine buzz.</v>

4788
02:19:08.111 --> 02:19:09.160
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't for me anyway,</v>

4789
02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:11.740
<v Speaker 4>it's just you feel like you can just,</v>

4790
02:19:12.370 --> 02:19:12.551
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4791
02:19:12.551 --> 02:19:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Have feeling when someone put it to me,</v>

4792
02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.390
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't a scientist,</v>

4793
02:19:15.390 --> 02:19:16.121
<v Speaker 4>it could be bullshit.</v>

4794
02:19:16.121 --> 02:19:16.920
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4795
02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:17.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4796
02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:19.240
<v Speaker 4>so we evolved to,</v>

4797
02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:21.073
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4798
02:19:21.510 --> 02:19:22.920
<v Speaker 4>we had this thing called executive focus,</v>

4799
02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:23.370
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4800
02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:24.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm executive focus on now,</v>

4801
02:19:24.631 --> 02:19:26.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm really concentrating on what I'm saying to you.</v>

4802
02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:27.680
<v Speaker 4>You the signals coming you right.</v>

4803
02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 4>But obviously we can't be in a state of executive focus all the time,</v>

4804
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:32.414
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4805
02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:35.560
<v Speaker 4>But what Modafinil does is it,</v>

4806
02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.630
<v Speaker 4>it makes you much more in a state of executive focus for longer.</v>

4807
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:40.310
<v Speaker 4>And you can see why people evolved to do that.</v>

4808
02:19:40.311 --> 02:19:41.144
<v Speaker 4>If you were,</v>

4809
02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.340
<v Speaker 4>and where we have all of you being chased by a lion,</v>

4810
02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.980
<v Speaker 4>you're brain just switches off all the other shit and he's like,</v>

4811
02:19:45.981 --> 02:19:47.180
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck away from the lion.</v>

4812
02:19:47.181 --> 02:19:47.421
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4813
02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:47.750
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4814
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:52.280
<v Speaker 4>And my understanding is that modafinil triggers that,</v>

4815
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:52.911
<v Speaker 4>that state,</v>

4816
02:19:52.911 --> 02:19:53.840
<v Speaker 4>not a panicked state,</v>

4817
02:19:53.841 --> 02:19:54.674
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

4818
02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:55.760
<v Speaker 4>executive focus date,</v>

4819
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:57.380
<v Speaker 4>which is good for a while,</v>

4820
02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 4>except there are two really big downsides to that.</v>

4821
02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Firstly,</v>

4822
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:02.420
<v Speaker 4>you don't sleep and if you don't sleep,</v>

4823
02:20:02.421 --> 02:20:03.320
<v Speaker 4>you were fucking crazy.</v>

4824
02:20:03.350 --> 02:20:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I'd never heard that there's an issue with sleeping and modafinil or provigil.</v>

4825
02:20:07.461 --> 02:20:07.851
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

4826
02:20:07.851 --> 02:20:09.380
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the positive aspects of it,</v>

4827
02:20:09.381 --> 02:20:10.400
<v Speaker 4>that you can sleep on it.</v>

4828
02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:10.761
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4829
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4830
02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:11.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4831
02:20:11.211 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 4>it was designed for people who find it hard to stay awake.</v>

4832
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:15.740
<v Speaker 4>And that's not true.</v>

4833
02:20:15.810 --> 02:20:16.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4834
02:20:16.530 --> 02:20:17.363
<v Speaker 6>that's what I'm reading.</v>

4835
02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:18.360
<v Speaker 6>What are you reading that?</v>

4836
02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:18.690
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4837
02:20:18.690 --> 02:20:19.920
<v Speaker 6>the guy who discovered it,</v>

4838
02:20:19.921 --> 02:20:23.340
<v Speaker 6>Michael is Uva was a sleep study.</v>

4839
02:20:23.610 --> 02:20:24.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4840
02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:29.060
<v Speaker 6>Neurophysiologist and was working on the compound add dry or address funnel and</v>

4841
02:20:30.811 --> 02:20:33.150
<v Speaker 6>then they discovered then made modafinil,</v>

4842
02:20:33.151 --> 02:20:34.590
<v Speaker 6>which is a stronger version of that.</v>

4843
02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 6>Mm.</v>

4844
02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:35.721
<v Speaker 3>So mine,</v>

4845
02:20:35.721 --> 02:20:39.500
<v Speaker 3>is there anything that says that it was originally developed?</v>

4846
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:41.170
<v Speaker 4>See anything like that?</v>

4847
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Fucking doctor.</v>

4848
02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:44.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4849
02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:46.060
<v Speaker 4>My experience was t two problems.</v>

4850
02:20:46.061 --> 02:20:47.020
<v Speaker 4>So firstly,</v>

4851
02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:47.740
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4852
02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how everyone says I haven't done a huge amount of research on this</v>

4853
02:20:49.861 --> 02:20:50.590
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>

4854
02:20:50.590 --> 02:20:53.770
<v Speaker 4>My experience was firstly not sleeping,</v>

4855
02:20:53.771 --> 02:20:55.330
<v Speaker 4>which is really bad for you over time.</v>

4856
02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:58.090
<v Speaker 4>And secondly actually if you're in that focused mode,</v>

4857
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:59.320
<v Speaker 4>so your,</v>

4858
02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.480
<v Speaker 4>your mind needs time wandering.</v>

4859
02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:02.381
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

4860
02:21:02.381 --> 02:21:03.730
<v Speaker 4>You mind needs time to wonder.</v>

4861
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:04.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4862
02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:05.560
<v Speaker 4>It needs time.</v>

4863
02:21:06.370 --> 02:21:06.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4864
02:21:06.581 --> 02:21:08.440
<v Speaker 4>if I just leave here and walk out there on the street,</v>

4865
02:21:08.441 --> 02:21:12.400
<v Speaker 4>my brain will just start wondering around loads of things and then it will go</v>

4866
02:21:12.401 --> 02:21:14.800
<v Speaker 4>back into executive focus when I do the next interview or whatever.</v>

4867
02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:19.150
<v Speaker 4>You need those periods when you're not in exact focus when you're exactly,</v>

4868
02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:20.350
<v Speaker 4>well not even recovery.</v>

4869
02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:22.180
<v Speaker 4>That's where recovery is part of it.</v>

4870
02:21:22.690 --> 02:21:24.580
<v Speaker 4>That's when your brain often has creative thoughts.</v>

4871
02:21:24.581 --> 02:21:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4872
02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:27.550
<v Speaker 4>When you're wondering where your mind is wondering when things will come to you</v>

4873
02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:31.120
<v Speaker 4>cause that a certain amount of your mind is processing things even though you're</v>

4874
02:21:31.121 --> 02:21:31.954
<v Speaker 4>not conscious of it.</v>

4875
02:21:32.010 --> 02:21:33.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what I felt with new vigil that it didn't,</v>

4876
02:21:34.170 --> 02:21:35.190
<v Speaker 3>new vigil or pro vigil,</v>

4877
02:21:35.191 --> 02:21:36.024
<v Speaker 3>they're very similar.</v>

4878
02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:40.590
<v Speaker 3>It didn't seem like there was much creativity going on that it was more of like</v>

4879
02:21:41.010 --> 02:21:42.810
<v Speaker 3>a grunt tool.</v>

4880
02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:43.673
<v Speaker 3>How long did you use it?</v>

4881
02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:44.170
<v Speaker 3>Portrait?</v>

4882
02:21:44.170 --> 02:21:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4883
02:21:44.850 --> 02:21:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

4884
02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I would not use it regularly.</v>

4885
02:21:47.101 --> 02:21:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I would take it like once a couple of weeks,</v>

4886
02:21:50.851 --> 02:21:52.170
<v Speaker 3>once a week or so like that.</v>

4887
02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:52.510
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4888
02:21:52.510 --> 02:21:53.060
<v Speaker 4>how long?</v>

4889
02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:54.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4890
02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.180
<v Speaker 4>I think I did it for like a year,</v>

4891
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:57.043
<v Speaker 4>a year or so,</v>

4892
02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:57.950
<v Speaker 4>and then I just stopped.</v>

4893
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I haven't taken it in years.</v>

4894
02:21:59.650 --> 02:22:00.040
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4895
02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:00.320
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4896
02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.153
<v Speaker 4>But I liked it.</v>

4897
02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:02.073
<v Speaker 4>What did you like</v>

4898
02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:02.721
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

4899
02:22:02.721 --> 02:22:03.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4900
02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:06.800
<v Speaker 3>some guy was a bio hacker who was the one who told me about it and he said it</v>

4901
02:22:06.801 --> 02:22:08.300
<v Speaker 3>was pretty easy to get a prescription for it.</v>

4902
02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I've got a prescription for it.</v>

4903
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4904
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 3>it just gave you like this pepped up sense of a focus and awareness felt you</v>

4905
02:22:14.991 --> 02:22:17.090
<v Speaker 3>could get a lot done when you're on it,</v>

4906
02:22:17.091 --> 02:22:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't seem like it helped with those wandering creative thoughts as you</v>

4907
02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:21.250
<v Speaker 3>were saying.</v>

4908
02:22:21.250 --> 02:22:21.491
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4909
02:22:21.491 --> 02:22:22.930
<v Speaker 4>If I was ever going to do exams again,</v>

4910
02:22:22.931 --> 02:22:24.310
<v Speaker 4>which fortunate we'll never do in my life,</v>

4911
02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:25.473
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4912
02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.610
<v Speaker 4>I would use that.</v>

4913
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:27.750
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

4914
02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:28.561
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

4915
02:22:28.561 --> 02:22:30.510
<v Speaker 4>And I think again,</v>

4916
02:22:30.511 --> 02:22:31.344
<v Speaker 4>thinking about that</v>

4917
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:36.030
<v Speaker 4>about in relation to addiction,</v>

4918
02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I think often when you talk about sing like work addiction,</v>

4919
02:22:40.321 --> 02:22:40.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4920
02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:43.740
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] caused by partly childhood trauma that I'd experienced.</v>

4921
02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:46.920
<v Speaker 4>There's been a real change in how we think about that as well.</v>

4922
02:22:46.921 --> 02:22:49.260
<v Speaker 4>It relates back to what we're saying right at the start about chemical hooks,</v>

4923
02:22:49.261 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4924
02:22:49.950 --> 02:22:51.890
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the debate about um,</v>

4925
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 4>non drug based addictions,</v>

4926
02:22:54.001 --> 02:22:54.251
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4927
02:22:54.251 --> 02:22:55.680
<v Speaker 4>If think about 20 years ago,</v>

4928
02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:58.470
<v Speaker 4>people start talking about sex addiction guy called Stanton peal,</v>

4929
02:22:58.471 --> 02:23:02.190
<v Speaker 4>who I interviewed a lot first writes about love addiction or smiling exactly.</v>

4930
02:23:02.191 --> 02:23:04.560
<v Speaker 4>Gambling addiction at the time.</v>

4931
02:23:04.561 --> 02:23:05.500
<v Speaker 4>Initially what people say,</v>

4932
02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:07.920
<v Speaker 4>well this is bullshit because they believe the chemical hooks there of</v>

4933
02:23:07.921 --> 02:23:08.290
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>

4934
02:23:08.290 --> 02:23:08.531
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4935
02:23:08.531 --> 02:23:09.120
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4936
02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:09.931
<v Speaker 4>So it just seems like,</v>

4937
02:23:09.931 --> 02:23:10.530
<v Speaker 4>well that's not,</v>

4938
02:23:10.530 --> 02:23:12.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's an episode of cheers actually,</v>

4939
02:23:12.001 --> 02:23:14.130
<v Speaker 4>which I'm now we're be,</v>

4940
02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:14.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4941
02:23:14.490 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't do this,</v>

4942
02:23:15.361 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 4>but there's an episode where the whole hilarious premise of the show is that</v>

4943
02:23:18.991 --> 02:23:19.780
<v Speaker 4>what's the Ted Danson,</v>

4944
02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:20.613
<v Speaker 4>Sam Malone,</v>

4945
02:23:20.970 --> 02:23:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Danson's character thinks he's a sex addict and this is like a punch line all</v>

4946
02:23:25.111 --> 02:23:25.861
<v Speaker 4>the way through the show.</v>

4947
02:23:25.861 --> 02:23:26.041
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4948
02:23:26.041 --> 02:23:27.890
<v Speaker 4>This was the attitude that ends with,</v>

4949
02:23:27.891 --> 02:23:31.440
<v Speaker 4>it goes through an meeting of sex and love addicts anonymous and like there's</v>

4950
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:33.630
<v Speaker 4>some women talking about how she gets like has sex with every,</v>

4951
02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:36.390
<v Speaker 4>every Madden ends with him just putting his arm around her and that's the end of</v>

4952
02:23:36.391 --> 02:23:36.720
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4953
02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:37.471
<v Speaker 4>the end of the show.</v>

4954
02:23:37.471 --> 02:23:37.741
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4955
02:23:37.741 --> 02:23:38.760
<v Speaker 4>That wouldn't happen in a sitcom.</v>

4956
02:23:38.761 --> 02:23:39.594
<v Speaker 4>Now people,</v>

4957
02:23:39.930 --> 02:23:40.763
<v Speaker 4>people thought,</v>

4958
02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:41.611
<v Speaker 4>well it might,</v>

4959
02:23:41.611 --> 02:23:43.680
<v Speaker 4>but people,</v>

4960
02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:44.760
<v Speaker 4>people don't think the,</v>

4961
02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:47.430
<v Speaker 4>the very idea of sex addiction is ridiculous in the way they did.</v>

4962
02:23:47.430 --> 02:23:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4963
02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:48.321
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

4964
02:23:48.321 --> 02:23:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe they do.</v>

4965
02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.100
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>

4966
02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:54.690
<v Speaker 4>but then I think that's because there hasn't been a shift in gamble.</v>

4967
02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:55.341
<v Speaker 4>If you go to a meeting,</v>

4968
02:23:55.341 --> 02:23:57.240
<v Speaker 4>a gambler's anonymous as I have with a friend,</v>

4969
02:23:57.241 --> 02:23:57.361
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

4970
02:23:57.361 --> 02:23:58.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a gambling problem,</v>

4971
02:23:58.381 --> 02:23:59.400
<v Speaker 4>but just to support someone.</v>

4972
02:23:59.910 --> 02:24:03.300
<v Speaker 4>They are as addicted as anyone in the next room down at narcotics anonymous.</v>

4973
02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:03.510
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>

4974
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:04.231
<v Speaker 4>a lot of,</v>

4975
02:24:04.231 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 4>not a lot of gambling addicts.</v>

4976
02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:07.590
<v Speaker 4>And did you feel that they were as a dictator,</v>

4977
02:24:07.650 --> 02:24:08.150
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>

4978
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:10.800
<v Speaker 4>they're straight up junkies and they might as well be chasing crack.</v>

4979
02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:11.090
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4980
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:13.740
<v Speaker 4>and that tells us something really important because you don't snore a roulette</v>

4981
02:24:13.741 --> 02:24:14.040
<v Speaker 4>wheel,</v>

4982
02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:14.251
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4983
02:24:14.251 --> 02:24:16.740
<v Speaker 4>You don't inject a an online poker,</v>

4984
02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:17.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4985
02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:19.470
<v Speaker 4>If you can have a professor not said this to me,</v>

4986
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:22.770
<v Speaker 4>if you can have all of the addiction,</v>

4987
02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:27.270
<v Speaker 4>but none of the chemical hooks that tells us about how we've overestimated the</v>

4988
02:24:27.271 --> 02:24:28.050
<v Speaker 4>role of calories,</v>

4989
02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:28.351
<v Speaker 4>addiction,</v>

4990
02:24:28.351 --> 02:24:29.310
<v Speaker 4>Chemical Hook,</v>

4991
02:24:29.730 --> 02:24:31.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a dopamine addiction.</v>

4992
02:24:31.350 --> 02:24:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Well absolutely everything you do that you like gives you dopamine.</v>

4993
02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:34.951
<v Speaker 4>It haven't been hit.</v>

4994
02:24:34.951 --> 02:24:37.260
<v Speaker 4>So I think there's been this attempt to integrate it by going,</v>

4995
02:24:37.290 --> 02:24:40.770
<v Speaker 4>oh well there's this pleasure in the brain and but it's also a of self</v>

4996
02:24:40.771 --> 02:24:41.790
<v Speaker 4>destructive issue.</v>

4997
02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:43.410
<v Speaker 4>There's something about gambling,</v>

4998
02:24:43.411 --> 02:24:46.380
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of self hate involved.</v>

4999
02:24:46.381 --> 02:24:46.521
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5000
02:24:46.521 --> 02:24:46.890
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5001
02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:47.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5002
02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:47.510
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

5003
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:50.990
<v Speaker 4>this overwhelming feeling of failure that a lot of,</v>

5004
02:24:50.991 --> 02:24:51.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5005
02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:54.640
<v Speaker 4>gambling addicts hub because they fail so often and they're,</v>

5006
02:24:54.641 --> 02:24:56.230
<v Speaker 4>they're always trying to chase the dragon.</v>

5007
02:24:56.250 --> 02:24:58.350
<v Speaker 4>They're always trying to make up for all the past things.</v>

5008
02:24:58.351 --> 02:24:59.190
<v Speaker 4>They've gone wrong.</v>

5009
02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 4>This big score with this big score,</v>

5010
02:25:01.501 --> 02:25:04.800
<v Speaker 4>are we going to settle it out towards me about it?</v>

5011
02:25:04.801 --> 02:25:06.390
<v Speaker 4>Just think about what you're saying in relation to him.</v>

5012
02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:08.340
<v Speaker 4>A guy called Peter Cohen,</v>

5013
02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:12.600
<v Speaker 4>he's a professor in the Netherlands who actually didn't say this to me directly.</v>

5014
02:25:12.601 --> 02:25:13.390
<v Speaker 4>I read it.</v>

5015
02:25:13.390 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5016
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:17.340
<v Speaker 4>he says we shouldn't call it addiction.</v>

5017
02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:18.450
<v Speaker 4>We should call it bonding.</v>

5018
02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Human beings have an innate need to bond and connect.</v>

5019
02:25:21.751 --> 02:25:22.584
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5020
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:24.340
<v Speaker 4>And you're happy and healthy.</v>

5021
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Your bond and connect with like the people around you with meaningful work.</v>

5022
02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:32.470
<v Speaker 4>If you can't do that cause you're isolated or traumatized or beaten down by</v>

5023
02:25:32.471 --> 02:25:32.741
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

5024
02:25:32.741 --> 02:25:33.910
<v Speaker 4>we haven't been taught how to do that.</v>

5025
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:38.590
<v Speaker 4>You will bond with something that gives you some sense of relief.</v>

5026
02:25:38.591 --> 02:25:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Right now for some people that might be porn,</v>

5027
02:25:40.691 --> 02:25:42.940
<v Speaker 4>for some people that might be gambling,</v>

5028
02:25:42.941 --> 02:25:44.260
<v Speaker 4>for some people might be cocaine,</v>

5029
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:44.801
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

5030
02:25:44.801 --> 02:25:45.634
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

5031
02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:46.031
<v Speaker 4>But it says,</v>

5032
02:25:46.031 --> 02:25:46.864
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

5033
02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.350
<v Speaker 4>if you only have one bond that's given you any relief,</v>

5034
02:25:50.351 --> 02:25:52.270
<v Speaker 4>you will obsessively returned to that bond.</v>

5035
02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:52.960
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5036
02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:53.990
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think that's a total lie.</v>

5037
02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:54.390
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

5038
02:25:54.390 --> 02:25:55.031
<v Speaker 4>and as he would say,</v>

5039
02:25:55.031 --> 02:25:57.280
<v Speaker 4>that's not a total explanation for what's going on.</v>

5040
02:25:57.540 --> 02:26:00.520
<v Speaker 4>But I do think that is a useful way to think about some of these behavioral</v>

5041
02:26:00.521 --> 02:26:00.971
<v Speaker 4>addictions.</v>

5042
02:26:00.971 --> 02:26:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5043
02:26:01.390 --> 02:26:02.020
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

5044
02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:03.550
<v Speaker 4>someone I know very well,</v>

5045
02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:04.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5046
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:07.120
<v Speaker 4>a relative of mine has a gambling addiction and this is someone who has,</v>

5047
02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:09.760
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

5048
02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.120
<v Speaker 4>No alternative form of joy or pleasure in their life.</v>

5049
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.983
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5050
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:15.463
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

5051
02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:16.710
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

5052
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:20.250
<v Speaker 4>gambling gives a moment among lots of moments.</v>

5053
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.970
<v Speaker 4>I've just such,</v>

5054
02:26:22.050 --> 02:26:24.020
<v Speaker 4>if you look at someone who's playing online poker as I've done,</v>

5055
02:26:24.021 --> 02:26:24.111
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

5056
02:26:24.111 --> 02:26:24.944
<v Speaker 4>my relative,</v>

5057
02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:27.570
<v Speaker 4>they're not happy or it's not a look at it.</v>

5058
02:26:27.571 --> 02:26:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Someone watching a nice movie,</v>

5059
02:26:28.711 --> 02:26:29.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5060
02:26:29.130 --> 02:26:29.790
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5061
02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:30.241
<v Speaker 4>you can see,</v>

5062
02:26:30.241 --> 02:26:30.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean,</v>

5063
02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:31.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

5064
02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:34.050
<v Speaker 4>I should be someone with an addiction problem playing online poker.</v>

5065
02:26:34.051 --> 02:26:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Some people have,</v>

5066
02:26:34.590 --> 02:26:35.730
<v Speaker 4>most people don't have a problem,</v>

5067
02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:36.723
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5068
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.943
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

5069
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:43.830
<v Speaker 4>it's the relief of just being absent from your life for a moment or for however</v>

5070
02:26:43.831 --> 02:26:44.461
<v Speaker 4>long you play,</v>

5071
02:26:44.461 --> 02:26:45.720
<v Speaker 4>rather than,</v>

5072
02:26:46.410 --> 02:26:47.243
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5073
02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:50.430
<v Speaker 4>I went to this fellow's connections,</v>

5074
02:26:50.431 --> 02:26:51.211
<v Speaker 4>my book about depression.</v>

5075
02:26:51.211 --> 02:26:55.350
<v Speaker 4>I went to the first ever Internet Rehab Center in the United States.</v>

5076
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:56.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird places,</v>

5077
02:26:57.050 --> 02:26:58.710
<v Speaker 4>oppressive place such that I liked the people there.</v>

5078
02:26:59.130 --> 02:27:01.470
<v Speaker 4>It's in Spokane and just outside Spokane in Washington.</v>

5079
02:27:02.310 --> 02:27:03.270
<v Speaker 4>It's called restart,</v>

5080
02:27:03.390 --> 02:27:04.320
<v Speaker 4>restart Washington.</v>

5081
02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:06.330
<v Speaker 4>And I remember going there.</v>

5082
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

5083
02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:09.060
<v Speaker 4>it was really interesting to think about this.</v>

5084
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5085
02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I remember arriving,</v>

5086
02:27:11.881 --> 02:27:13.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a clearing in the woods,</v>

5087
02:27:13.081 --> 02:27:13.261
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5088
02:27:13.261 --> 02:27:14.970
<v Speaker 4>A big wooden place in the clearing of the woods.</v>

5089
02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.570
<v Speaker 4>I remember absolutely instinctively looking at my phone and feeling really when</v>

5090
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:21.870
<v Speaker 4>a minute I got out the car and fit of really pissed off that I can check my</v>

5091
02:27:21.871 --> 02:27:22.171
<v Speaker 4>email.</v>

5092
02:27:22.171 --> 02:27:22.400
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

5093
02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:22.591
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>

5094
02:27:22.591 --> 02:27:23.311
<v Speaker 4>you're in the right place.</v>

5095
02:27:23.311 --> 02:27:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5096
02:27:24.090 --> 02:27:24.923
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5097
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.651
<v Speaker 4>and it's an ancient cause.</v>

5098
02:27:25.651 --> 02:27:27.450
<v Speaker 4>They get all kinds of people and restart Washington,</v>

5099
02:27:27.451 --> 02:27:31.330
<v Speaker 4>but they disproportionately get young men who are obsessed with multiplayer role</v>

5100
02:27:31.331 --> 02:27:31.771
<v Speaker 4>play games.</v>

5101
02:27:31.771 --> 02:27:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5102
02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.350
<v Speaker 4>then it would have been world of Warcraft and how it'd be fortnight.</v>

5103
02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:37.950
<v Speaker 4>And speaking to these young men</v>

5104
02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:41.491
<v Speaker 4>have this realization,</v>

5105
02:27:41.491 --> 02:27:42.810
<v Speaker 4>talking to the woman who runs it.</v>

5106
02:27:42.811 --> 02:27:44.660
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing when called Dr Hillary cash.</v>

5107
02:27:45.470 --> 02:27:46.440
<v Speaker 4>He said to me,</v>

5108
02:27:47.430 --> 02:27:48.510
<v Speaker 4>you've got to ask.</v>

5109
02:27:49.290 --> 02:27:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it relates to what you saying about gambling.</v>

5110
02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:54.870
<v Speaker 4>You got to ask what these young men are getting out of this game because they're</v>

5111
02:27:54.871 --> 02:27:55.710
<v Speaker 4>getting something out of it.</v>

5112
02:27:55.711 --> 02:27:56.544
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5113
02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:00.810
<v Speaker 4>And she argues that one of the things that getting is the things they used to</v>

5114
02:28:00.811 --> 02:28:01.890
<v Speaker 4>get from the culture,</v>

5115
02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:03.390
<v Speaker 4>but no longer gap.</v>

5116
02:28:03.450 --> 02:28:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

5117
02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:05.040
<v Speaker 4>what are filling?</v>

5118
02:28:05.041 --> 02:28:05.910
<v Speaker 4>They're good at something,</v>

5119
02:28:06.470 --> 02:28:07.920
<v Speaker 4>a feeling that other people see them,</v>

5120
02:28:07.921 --> 02:28:09.060
<v Speaker 4>that they're part of a tribe,</v>

5121
02:28:09.470 --> 02:28:10.950
<v Speaker 4>a feeling that they're moving around,</v>

5122
02:28:10.951 --> 02:28:11.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5123
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:11.610
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5124
02:28:11.610 --> 02:28:13.830
<v Speaker 4>kids spend very little time outdoors now.</v>

5125
02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5126
02:28:14.370 --> 02:28:16.080
<v Speaker 4>I think there's also anticipation.</v>

5127
02:28:16.081 --> 02:28:16.891
<v Speaker 4>There's puzzles,</v>

5128
02:28:16.891 --> 02:28:19.140
<v Speaker 4>there's things where you're trying to figure out whether or not something's</v>

5129
02:28:19.141 --> 02:28:20.610
<v Speaker 4>right or wrong and how to get it.</v>

5130
02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 4>And if you do get it,</v>

5131
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you get this positive surge of you don't get,</v>

5132
02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:24.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5133
02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I think there's human reward systems that are being mirrored there in gambling.</v>

5134
02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:29.580
<v Speaker 4>And what psychologists call,</v>

5135
02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:31.020
<v Speaker 4>call that feeling of mastery.</v>

5136
02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:31.830
<v Speaker 4>The masters,</v>

5137
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:33.330
<v Speaker 4>when you feel you are good at something,</v>

5138
02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:33.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5139
02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:35.850
<v Speaker 4>It's an absolutely underlying psychological need.</v>

5140
02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Everyone needs to feel that good at something.</v>

5141
02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:39.600
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have a sense of mastery in your life,</v>

5142
02:28:39.601 --> 02:28:40.800
<v Speaker 4>you will be depressed and anxious.</v>

5143
02:28:40.801 --> 02:28:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5144
02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Or you're much more likely to become depressed and anxious.</v>

5145
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:44.423
<v Speaker 4>And I think again,</v>

5146
02:28:44.490 --> 02:28:45.810
<v Speaker 4>because it's very striking to me,</v>

5147
02:28:45.811 --> 02:28:47.070
<v Speaker 4>I've got teenage nephews,</v>

5148
02:28:47.130 --> 02:28:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I've got sons.</v>

5149
02:28:49.170 --> 02:28:52.200
<v Speaker 4>We actually don't ask anything of young men.</v>

5150
02:28:52.470 --> 02:28:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5151
02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:56.280
<v Speaker 4>Very rarely are they actually asked to do very much.</v>

5152
02:28:56.670 --> 02:28:58.740
<v Speaker 4>They're not given responsibilities.</v>

5153
02:28:58.741 --> 02:28:59.011
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5154
02:28:59.011 --> 02:29:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I think I look again,</v>

5155
02:29:01.351 --> 02:29:03.510
<v Speaker 4>I want to stress and most people playing video games or not addicted,</v>

5156
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:05.160
<v Speaker 4>it's perfectly good form a pleasure.</v>

5157
02:29:05.161 --> 02:29:06.150
<v Speaker 4>They're very addictive.</v>

5158
02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:06.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5159
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.823
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

5160
02:29:07.890 --> 02:29:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Most people playing them have a healthy relationship with them.</v>

5161
02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:10.681
<v Speaker 4>And the same way that,</v>

5162
02:29:10.681 --> 02:29:11.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true,</v>

5163
02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:13.230
<v Speaker 4>can maybe tell me about it.</v>

5164
02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.820
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people playing them have a real problem with them.</v>

5165
02:29:15.821 --> 02:29:17.710
<v Speaker 3>They take up massive hours at a time.</v>

5166
02:29:17.711 --> 02:29:19.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant problem with young boys.</v>

5167
02:29:20.350 --> 02:29:21.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

5168
02:29:21.090 --> 02:29:25.210
<v Speaker 3>the thing is it's become an actual avenue for career.</v>

5169
02:29:25.211 --> 02:29:30.211
<v Speaker 3>Now there's east sports careers where these young guys are making millions of</v>

5170
02:29:30.850 --> 02:29:31.840
<v Speaker 3>dollars playing video games.</v>

5171
02:29:31.841 --> 02:29:33.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the old days where you would say,</v>

5172
02:29:33.641 --> 02:29:33.851
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5173
02:29:33.851 --> 02:29:34.750
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting your life.</v>

5174
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Now it's basically almost like practicing golf.</v>

5175
02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:39.220
<v Speaker 3>But we have a set up back here.</v>

5176
02:29:39.221 --> 02:29:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Well we play video games against each other.</v>

5177
02:29:41.111 --> 02:29:42.310
<v Speaker 3>That's very addictive.</v>

5178
02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think it's addictive?</v>

5179
02:29:43.930 --> 02:29:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5180
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:45.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5181
02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:46.960
<v Speaker 3>so it's like basketball when I was younger too,</v>

5182
02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I loved playing basketball,</v>

5183
02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:49.960
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get me to play in the rain.</v>

5184
02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:54.730
<v Speaker 3>The basketball has movement and exercise attached to it so you get some positive</v>

5185
02:29:54.731 --> 02:29:55.780
<v Speaker 3>benefit from that addiction.</v>

5186
02:29:55.810 --> 02:29:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I was definitely addicted to Jujitsu.</v>

5187
02:29:58.010 --> 02:29:59.620
<v Speaker 3>I would even train when I was injured,</v>

5188
02:29:59.710 --> 02:30:00.011
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5189
02:30:00.011 --> 02:30:00.970
<v Speaker 3>But what does that mean?</v>

5190
02:30:00.971 --> 02:30:03.340
<v Speaker 3>It means I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed not doing it.</v>

5191
02:30:03.730 --> 02:30:08.020
<v Speaker 3>The difference between a lot of video game addictions and particularly gambling</v>

5192
02:30:08.021 --> 02:30:11.140
<v Speaker 3>addictions is that they tend to wreck people's lives.</v>

5193
02:30:11.390 --> 02:30:11.841
<v Speaker 4>You didn't,</v>

5194
02:30:11.841 --> 02:30:13.760
<v Speaker 4>when you had this period of Jujitsu addiction,</v>

5195
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:14.773
<v Speaker 4>did you,</v>

5196
02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:17.570
<v Speaker 4>did you cause they distinction distinction there?</v>

5197
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:21.350
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing it to avoid some kind of pain in your life or were you doing</v>

5198
02:30:21.351 --> 02:30:22.910
<v Speaker 4>it because you just really deeply loved?</v>

5199
02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:23.753
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun.</v>

5200
02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Brio.</v>

5201
02:30:24.490 --> 02:30:25.790
<v Speaker 3>See chasing the thrill.</v>

5202
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:26.241
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5203
02:30:26.241 --> 02:30:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm certain that was avoiding pain with almost everything I've done in my life</v>

5204
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:31.401
<v Speaker 3>in some way,</v>

5205
02:30:31.401 --> 02:30:32.270
<v Speaker 3>shape or form.</v>

5206
02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:32.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5207
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:35.870
<v Speaker 3>there's some of it where you're trying to do something positive to mitigate the</v>

5208
02:30:35.871 --> 02:30:39.800
<v Speaker 3>pain or the frustration or the anger or whatever it is that's bothering you.</v>

5209
02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:41.270
<v Speaker 3>But I don't,</v>

5210
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5211
02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5212
02:30:42.130 --> 02:30:42.261
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5213
02:30:42.261 --> 02:30:44.240
<v Speaker 3>the video game thing was a real addiction though.</v>

5214
02:30:44.241 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like a compulsion.</v>

5215
02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:47.390
<v Speaker 3>And Alan was yours.</v>

5216
02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5217
02:30:48.250 --> 02:30:48.960
<v Speaker 3>How did you,</v>

5218
02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:49.950
<v Speaker 3>how did you get out of the Jay?</v>

5219
02:30:50.060 --> 02:30:50.893
<v Speaker 3>I quit.</v>

5220
02:30:51.140 --> 02:30:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I just quit cold Turkey.</v>

5221
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Stop playing.</v>

5222
02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I realized it was kind of messing up my life and my career was just taking up</v>

5223
02:30:57.141 --> 02:30:58.220
<v Speaker 3>way too much time.</v>

5224
02:30:58.580 --> 02:30:58.960
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>

5225
02:30:58.960 --> 02:30:59.200
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5226
02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:00.860
<v Speaker 3>I came to a realization and I was like,</v>

5227
02:31:00.861 --> 02:31:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I gotta stop doing this.</v>

5228
02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:03.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm just playing way too much.</v>

5229
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:04.670
<v Speaker 3>And so I just said,</v>

5230
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:05.630
<v Speaker 3>the only way I,</v>

5231
02:31:05.631 --> 02:31:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm just too competitive.</v>

5232
02:31:06.831 --> 02:31:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it too much.</v>

5233
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:11.270
<v Speaker 3>And so the only way to do it was to stop playing it all together.</v>

5234
02:31:11.271 --> 02:31:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And we started playing it again recently after more than Shit,</v>

5235
02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:17.480
<v Speaker 3>more than 15 years of ever playing it at all,</v>

5236
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:18.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5237
02:31:18.081 --> 02:31:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

5238
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:19.920
<v Speaker 3>it's addictive,</v>

5239
02:31:19.921 --> 02:31:21.180
<v Speaker 3>but I'm so busy now,</v>

5240
02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I can't really fall into the grip of it.</v>

5241
02:31:23.011 --> 02:31:25.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually just enjoying it for an hour here or there.</v>

5242
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.090
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

5243
02:31:26.090 --> 02:31:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5244
02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:26.861
<v Speaker 4>interesting in itself,</v>

5245
02:31:26.861 --> 02:31:27.131
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

5246
02:31:27.131 --> 02:31:28.780
<v Speaker 4>That's a bit like the rap part principle.</v>

5247
02:31:28.781 --> 02:31:29.381
<v Speaker 4>It feels to me,</v>

5248
02:31:29.381 --> 02:31:30.214
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

5249
02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:31.413
<v Speaker 4>that light,</v>

5250
02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:34.190
<v Speaker 4>the more you have in your life,</v>

5251
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:35.810
<v Speaker 4>that is meaningful,</v>

5252
02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.670
<v Speaker 4>that is good.</v>

5253
02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:40.040
<v Speaker 4>Am gives you pleasure or a sense of mastery,</v>

5254
02:31:40.310 --> 02:31:44.330
<v Speaker 4>the less space they will be for these objects of obsessions come in.</v>

5255
02:31:44.331 --> 02:31:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5256
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:46.370
<v Speaker 4>And I think that is a principle.</v>

5257
02:31:46.371 --> 02:31:47.204
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

5258
02:31:47.210 --> 02:31:49.610
<v Speaker 4>This was the principle behind the Portuguese drug decriminalization,</v>

5259
02:31:49.611 --> 02:31:50.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5260
02:31:50.270 --> 02:31:52.040
<v Speaker 4>If we give people good lives,</v>

5261
02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:54.260
<v Speaker 4>they will not want to anesthetize themselves so much.</v>

5262
02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:57.830
<v Speaker 4>It was the Swiss principle and I think we all see that in our lives to different</v>

5263
02:31:57.831 --> 02:31:58.520
<v Speaker 4>degrees.</v>

5264
02:31:58.520 --> 02:31:59.353
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5265
02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:00.373
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5266
02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:04.210
<v Speaker 4>the happier I am,</v>

5267
02:32:04.690 --> 02:32:06.820
<v Speaker 4>the less I want to turn to,</v>

5268
02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:07.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5269
02:32:07.720 --> 02:32:08.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5270
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:12.640
<v Speaker 4>the behaviors that I developed as a child to avoid being present with like</v>

5271
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:13.540
<v Speaker 4>violence and aggression.</v>

5272
02:32:14.270 --> 02:32:15.103
<v Speaker 5>Like</v>

5273
02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:18.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't think of like writing as an addiction.</v>

5274
02:32:18.461 --> 02:32:20.580
<v Speaker 4>It's might be a compulsion if I have a day when I didn't do it,</v>

5275
02:32:20.581 --> 02:32:21.221
<v Speaker 4>I feel terrible.</v>

5276
02:32:21.221 --> 02:32:24.190
<v Speaker 4>But something that is positive and rewarding,</v>

5277
02:32:24.191 --> 02:32:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't think is an addiction.</v>

5278
02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5279
02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:28.940
<v Speaker 4>Something that enriches your life and is not,</v>

5280
02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:30.580
<v Speaker 4>it's a way of living life.</v>

5281
02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:32.380
<v Speaker 4>The most fulfilling way.</v>

5282
02:32:32.390 --> 02:32:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Theme session,</v>

5283
02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:34.690
<v Speaker 4>maybe a positive obsession,</v>

5284
02:32:35.410 --> 02:32:36.011
<v Speaker 4>compulsion,</v>

5285
02:32:36.011 --> 02:32:36.820
<v Speaker 4>obsession,</v>

5286
02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:37.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5287
02:32:37.570 --> 02:32:38.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5288
02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:39.670
<v Speaker 4>a way of being in the world,</v>

5289
02:32:39.671 --> 02:32:40.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5290
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:41.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't,</v>

5291
02:32:41.470 --> 02:32:42.850
<v Speaker 4>it's like sometimes I get people saying to me,</v>

5292
02:32:42.851 --> 02:32:43.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5293
02:32:43.091 --> 02:32:43.331
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5294
02:32:43.331 --> 02:32:43.990
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5295
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:47.220
<v Speaker 4>am I addicted to sex in or whatever and you want to say it.</v>

5296
02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:47.711
<v Speaker 4>I often say,</v>

5297
02:32:47.711 --> 02:32:48.544
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5298
02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:50.570
<v Speaker 5>does it give you pleasure?</v>

5299
02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:52.243
<v Speaker 5>Does it,</v>

5300
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:53.743
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>

5301
02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:54.870
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>

5302
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:57.880
<v Speaker 4>and is it a way of avoiding pain if it gives you pleasure and it's not a way of</v>

5303
02:32:57.890 --> 02:32:58.920
<v Speaker 4>avoiding pain is not an addiction.</v>

5304
02:32:58.921 --> 02:32:59.670
<v Speaker 4>It's just a way,</v>

5305
02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:00.990
<v Speaker 4>a happy way of being in the world.</v>

5306
02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:01.650
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5307
02:33:01.650 --> 02:33:02.940
<v Speaker 4>And that's the reality for,</v>

5308
02:33:03.690 --> 02:33:04.021
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

5309
02:33:04.021 --> 02:33:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really helps us because partly what I'm arguing in loss in Las</v>

5310
02:33:08.791 --> 02:33:12.030
<v Speaker 4>collection and chasing scream is we need to deeply reconceptualize how we think</v>

5311
02:33:12.031 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 4>about these forms of pain like depression and addiction.</v>

5312
02:33:14.461 --> 02:33:15.680
<v Speaker 4>And this isn't some wacky basis,</v>

5313
02:33:15.690 --> 02:33:17.010
<v Speaker 4>the view of the World Health Organization,</v>

5314
02:33:17.011 --> 02:33:19.410
<v Speaker 4>these leading medical bodies when it comes to depression,</v>

5315
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:21.330
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5316
02:33:21.330 --> 02:33:21.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5317
02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:22.523
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

5318
02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:27.450
<v Speaker 3>People that are journalists and writers often like stimulants,</v>

5319
02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:28.710
<v Speaker 3>they often like Adderall.</v>

5320
02:33:28.711 --> 02:33:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Adderall is a big issue for,</v>

5321
02:33:31.350 --> 02:33:31.710
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

5322
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:32.700
<v Speaker 3>for journalists.</v>

5323
02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:34.590
<v Speaker 3>How much experience do you have with that?</v>

5324
02:33:34.591 --> 02:33:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Are All I'm to be used it,</v>

5325
02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:37.410
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be amazing.</v>

5326
02:33:37.530 --> 02:33:38.363
<v Speaker 3>You need it.</v>

5327
02:33:38.690 --> 02:33:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Never used it precisely because I know I would love it,</v>

5328
02:33:40.970 --> 02:33:41.271
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5329
02:33:41.271 --> 02:33:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I would,</v>

5330
02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I've got a young relative whose prescribed it and um,</v>

5331
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:49.400
<v Speaker 4>that are the times when I've been telling you he's a,</v>

5332
02:33:49.401 --> 02:33:49.821
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5333
02:33:49.821 --> 02:33:50.480
<v Speaker 4>he's offered,</v>

5334
02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.310
<v Speaker 4>tried to not spike me,</v>

5335
02:33:52.311 --> 02:33:53.500
<v Speaker 4>but like it's a joy to,</v>

5336
02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:56.450
<v Speaker 4>and this is for you,</v>

5337
02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:56.920
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

5338
02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:59.450
<v Speaker 4>there's Adderall opens up a whole other thing.</v>

5339
02:33:59.451 --> 02:33:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5340
02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Which is this what you're talking about again,</v>

5341
02:34:02.331 --> 02:34:04.730
<v Speaker 4>which is I'm not against people,</v>

5342
02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:07.490
<v Speaker 4>obviously not against people using drugs in order to enhance their lives.</v>

5343
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:08.810
<v Speaker 4>And I have,</v>

5344
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.921
<v Speaker 4>before I came here,</v>

5345
02:34:09.921 --> 02:34:12.530
<v Speaker 4>I drank enough caffeine to kill a whole fucking field of cows.</v>

5346
02:34:12.531 --> 02:34:13.100
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5347
02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:14.870
<v Speaker 4>I assume viewers could probably tell,</v>

5348
02:34:15.090 --> 02:34:15.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5349
02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5350
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:16.663
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

5351
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I limit my stimulant use because,</v>

5352
02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:22.413
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5353
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:26.590
<v Speaker 4>because I know I can teach and I can tell that I could easily,</v>

5354
02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:28.960
<v Speaker 4>a bit like we to beat the Modafinil when I started using modafinil.</v>

5355
02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:29.561
<v Speaker 4>I got that sense.</v>

5356
02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:31.120
<v Speaker 4>I just used it everyday for three months.</v>

5357
02:34:31.121 --> 02:34:31.391
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5358
02:34:31.391 --> 02:34:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Which was ludicrous thing to do.</v>

5359
02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:36.190
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

5360
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:39.610
<v Speaker 4>I think in terms of stimulants,</v>

5361
02:34:39.611 --> 02:34:41.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole debate that needs to be had.</v>

5362
02:34:41.531 --> 02:34:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

5363
02:34:41.770 --> 02:34:43.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write about this at some point,</v>

5364
02:34:43.061 --> 02:34:45.580
<v Speaker 4>but one in 10,</v>

5365
02:34:45.581 --> 02:34:50.110
<v Speaker 4>13 year old boys in this country is being given a stimulant drug,</v>

5366
02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:50.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5367
02:34:50.890 --> 02:34:51.670
<v Speaker 4>In any given year,</v>

5368
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:52.061
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5369
02:34:52.061 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 4>For add or Adhd or,</v>

5370
02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5371
02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:57.400
<v Speaker 4>that is horrifying.</v>

5372
02:34:57.430 --> 02:34:58.070
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

5373
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5374
02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:01.120
<v Speaker 4>30% of children in foster care in the United States,</v>

5375
02:35:01.121 --> 02:35:02.890
<v Speaker 4>I've been given at least one psychiatric drug.</v>

5376
02:35:03.370 --> 02:35:05.860
<v Speaker 4>These are not children in the main who are,</v>

5377
02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:06.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5378
02:35:06.371 --> 02:35:07.900
<v Speaker 4>have some biological insanity.</v>

5379
02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:10.800
<v Speaker 4>These are kids who've been fucking abused and treated a bit smelly.</v>

5380
02:35:10.801 --> 02:35:11.411
<v Speaker 4>And what do we do?</v>

5381
02:35:11.411 --> 02:35:12.610
<v Speaker 4>We drug them to shut them up,</v>

5382
02:35:12.611 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5383
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5384
02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 4>it's also children have a lot of energy and it's not easy to control them.</v>

5385
02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:20.500
<v Speaker 4>And so they decide that these children have something wrong with them.</v>

5386
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.921
<v Speaker 4>Do you know,</v>

5387
02:35:20.921 --> 02:35:22.810
<v Speaker 4>I went to this Amish village Veloce connections,</v>

5388
02:35:22.811 --> 02:35:23.860
<v Speaker 4>but one thing that was really interesting,</v>

5389
02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:26.470
<v Speaker 4>there are these people who argued there needs to be more research on this,</v>

5390
02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:28.750
<v Speaker 4>but Amish children don't get ADHD.</v>

5391
02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:29.081
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5392
02:35:29.081 --> 02:35:30.580
<v Speaker 4>And this is big debate what's going on there.</v>

5393
02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:33.880
<v Speaker 4>And so this one argument,</v>

5394
02:35:33.881 --> 02:35:36.520
<v Speaker 4>which is then obviously not exposed to digital media,</v>

5395
02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:37.413
<v Speaker 4>which may,</v>

5396
02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:40.120
<v Speaker 4>and there's some evidence of just speaking to professor Steven Lee here,</v>

5397
02:35:40.121 --> 02:35:43.390
<v Speaker 4>but people are getting a lot loads of ADHD when I was in school and they're</v>

5398
02:35:43.430 --> 02:35:43.861
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

5399
02:35:43.861 --> 02:35:44.121
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5400
02:35:44.121 --> 02:35:44.501
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

5401
02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:45.330
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

5402
02:35:45.330 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 4>that's just because I spoke to guy at Ucla,</v>

5403
02:35:47.261 --> 02:35:48.160
<v Speaker 4>Professor Stephen Asian.</v>

5404
02:35:48.161 --> 02:35:49.390
<v Speaker 4>There's some effect of digital media,</v>

5405
02:35:49.391 --> 02:35:50.111
<v Speaker 4>but it's not massive.</v>

5406
02:35:50.111 --> 02:35:50.291
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5407
02:35:50.291 --> 02:35:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5408
02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:51.693
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5409
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:54.310
<v Speaker 4>I think what's happening from the very small amount of research you,</v>

5410
02:35:54.311 --> 02:35:56.260
<v Speaker 4>you're talking to the Amish is,</v>

5411
02:35:56.290 --> 02:35:56.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5412
02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:57.101
<v Speaker 4>I'd say to them,</v>

5413
02:35:57.101 --> 02:35:58.570
<v Speaker 4>do you have kids who don't want to sit still?</v>

5414
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

5415
02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:00.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5416
02:36:00.130 --> 02:36:01.210
<v Speaker 4>we'll let them go golf and go fishing.</v>

5417
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5418
02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:04.270
<v Speaker 4>The Amish don't want to make you sit still for eight hours a day,</v>

5419
02:36:04.290 --> 02:36:04.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5420
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:07.160
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing in their society that I'm not idealizing.</v>

5421
02:36:07.161 --> 02:36:10.440
<v Speaker 4>The Amish has problems with getting a child to sit still for eight hours a day,</v>

5422
02:36:10.990 --> 02:36:13.540
<v Speaker 4>just like trying to get a puppy to sit still for eight hours a day.</v>

5423
02:36:13.541 --> 02:36:13.961
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5424
02:36:13.961 --> 02:36:15.130
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly the right analogy.</v>

5425
02:36:15.131 --> 02:36:16.900
<v Speaker 4>What we do to our children.</v>

5426
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:22.950
<v Speaker 4>We try to deaden them and discipline them to cope and thrive in a dead end and</v>

5427
02:36:24.761 --> 02:36:26.290
<v Speaker 4>disciplines and inverted commerce economy.</v>

5428
02:36:26.291 --> 02:36:26.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5429
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:27.783
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

5430
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:31.120
<v Speaker 4>the school system was designed in the 1870s to prepare people to work in</v>

5431
02:36:31.121 --> 02:36:31.691
<v Speaker 4>factories,</v>

5432
02:36:31.691 --> 02:36:32.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5433
02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:34.270
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to work in a factory in the 1870s,</v>

5434
02:36:34.271 --> 02:36:34.990
<v Speaker 4>what do you need?</v>

5435
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:36.400
<v Speaker 4>You need to learn to shut the fuck up,</v>

5436
02:36:36.970 --> 02:36:37.803
<v Speaker 4>not complain,</v>

5437
02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:38.793
<v Speaker 4>be passive.</v>

5438
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:39.790
<v Speaker 4>Do what you're told.</v>

5439
02:36:39.970 --> 02:36:40.520
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5440
02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:40.720
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

5441
02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:41.111
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

5442
02:36:41.111 --> 02:36:41.944
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5443
02:36:42.510 --> 02:36:44.150
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a guy called Alfred cone.</v>

5444
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it's him who says every school has two curriculums or curricular over</v>

5445
02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 4>the pluralists you've got the official curriculum,</v>

5446
02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:52.210
<v Speaker 4>which is like geography,</v>

5447
02:36:52.211 --> 02:36:52.631
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

5448
02:36:52.631 --> 02:36:53.464
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

5449
02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:55.150
<v Speaker 4>And then you have the hidden curriculum,</v>

5450
02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:58.900
<v Speaker 4>which is the kind of person the school is trying to make you into.</v>

5451
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.033
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5452
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.490
<v Speaker 4>And what is the school system designed to base designed to make people who are</v>

5453
02:37:03.491 --> 02:37:04.324
<v Speaker 4>passive,</v>

5454
02:37:04.690 --> 02:37:05.523
<v Speaker 4>who are,</v>

5455
02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:06.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5456
02:37:06.610 --> 02:37:07.443
<v Speaker 4>obedient,</v>

5457
02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:10.660
<v Speaker 4>who sit still and shut the fuck up right now.</v>

5458
02:37:10.661 --> 02:37:12.490
<v Speaker 4>That was never a good way to make humans,</v>

5459
02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:12.821
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5460
02:37:12.821 --> 02:37:14.110
<v Speaker 4>That was always wrong.</v>

5461
02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:16.490
<v Speaker 4>But it's particularly awful in the,</v>

5462
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5463
02:37:16.791 --> 02:37:17.930
<v Speaker 4>the culture we created.</v>

5464
02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:18.980
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5465
02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:21.800
<v Speaker 4>and this relates to one of the causes of depression that I write about in Los</v>

5466
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:21.801
<v Speaker 4>Connections,</v>

5467
02:37:21.801 --> 02:37:22.520
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

5468
02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:23.353
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5469
02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:24.080
<v Speaker 4>it's really good.</v>

5470
02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I know it's the loads of the people I know who are depressed and anxious.</v>

5471
02:37:26.930 --> 02:37:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Their depression and anxiety focuses around their work.</v>

5472
02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:30.051
<v Speaker 4>We talked about this last time.</v>

5473
02:37:30.051 --> 02:37:30.884
<v Speaker 4>I was on a thing,</v>

5474
02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:31.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5475
02:37:31.690 --> 02:37:32.091
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

5476
02:37:32.091 --> 02:37:32.900
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5477
02:37:32.900 --> 02:37:33.201
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

5478
02:37:33.201 --> 02:37:33.651
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

5479
02:37:33.651 --> 02:37:34.580
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're unusual,</v>

5480
02:37:34.581 --> 02:37:35.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5481
02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:36.740
<v Speaker 4>So start to look at the evidence base.</v>

5482
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:39.710
<v Speaker 4>Gallup did a really big study of people in the U S and Europe.</v>

5483
02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:40.251
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

5484
02:37:40.251 --> 02:37:41.660
<v Speaker 4>what do people feel about their work?</v>

5485
02:37:41.661 --> 02:37:42.494
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5486
02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:44.990
<v Speaker 4>13% of people,</v>

5487
02:37:44.991 --> 02:37:45.231
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

5488
02:37:45.231 --> 02:37:46.970
<v Speaker 4>3% like their work,</v>

5489
02:37:46.971 --> 02:37:47.804
<v Speaker 4>most of the time,</v>

5490
02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:51.260
<v Speaker 4>63% of what they called sleep working,</v>

5491
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5492
02:37:51.951 --> 02:37:52.281
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>

5493
02:37:52.281 --> 02:37:52.791
<v Speaker 4>you don't hate it.</v>

5494
02:37:52.791 --> 02:37:53.690
<v Speaker 4>You kind of tolerate it.</v>

5495
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 4>And 24% of people fucking hate and fear their jobs.</v>

5496
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:58.790
<v Speaker 4>And so you think about that,</v>

5497
02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:03.200
<v Speaker 4>that means 87% of people don't like the thing they're doing most of the time.</v>

5498
02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:03.471
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

5499
02:38:03.471 --> 02:38:05.690
<v Speaker 4>that can't be far off what the figure was in the Soviet Union,</v>

5500
02:38:05.691 --> 02:38:05.871
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5501
02:38:05.871 --> 02:38:07.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a really extreme,</v>

5502
02:38:07.011 --> 02:38:07.660
<v Speaker 4>bigger.</v>

5503
02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:08.493
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5504
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:09.463
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

5505
02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:10.820
<v Speaker 4>so I'm looking at this,</v>

5506
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking,</v>

5507
02:38:11.631 --> 02:38:11.900
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5508
02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:14.930
<v Speaker 4>could this bear some relationship to our mental health crisis,</v>

5509
02:38:14.931 --> 02:38:15.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5510
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:19.400
<v Speaker 4>This thing that we don't like is spreading over more and more of our day.</v>

5511
02:38:19.401 --> 02:38:21.290
<v Speaker 4>The average person I think answers the first email,</v>

5512
02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:24.650
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 7:43 AM and leaves work at 7:15 PM right?</v>

5513
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:28.130
<v Speaker 4>W and I learned this in an amazing Australian social scientists or went to</v>

5514
02:38:28.131 --> 02:38:31.250
<v Speaker 4>interview call professor Michael Marmot who discovered the key factor that</v>

5515
02:38:31.251 --> 02:38:32.360
<v Speaker 4>causes depression at work,</v>

5516
02:38:32.361 --> 02:38:33.194
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5517
02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:33.951
<v Speaker 4>If you go to,</v>

5518
02:38:33.951 --> 02:38:34.680
<v Speaker 4>it's not the only one,</v>

5519
02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:35.513
<v Speaker 4>but key factor.</v>

5520
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:40.750
<v Speaker 4>If you go to work tomorrow and you are controlled so you have low or no control</v>

5521
02:38:40.971 --> 02:38:44.060
<v Speaker 4>over your work are much more likely to become depressed and anxious.</v>

5522
02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:45.620
<v Speaker 4>I think it relates to what we've been talking about all along.</v>

5523
02:38:45.621 --> 02:38:46.940
<v Speaker 4>People have psychological needs.</v>

5524
02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:48.200
<v Speaker 4>You need to feel you're good at something,</v>

5525
02:38:48.201 --> 02:38:49.034
<v Speaker 4>you need to build.</v>

5526
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Your life has meaning.</v>

5527
02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:52.400
<v Speaker 4>If you're controlled all the time,</v>

5528
02:38:52.401 --> 02:38:53.210
<v Speaker 4>you can't feel that.</v>

5529
02:38:53.210 --> 02:38:54.043
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5530
02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:55.340
<v Speaker 4>So when I first learned this,</v>

5531
02:38:55.341 --> 02:38:59.780
<v Speaker 4>I remember first time I went to see professor [inaudible] like misunderstanding</v>

5532
02:38:59.781 --> 02:39:03.410
<v Speaker 4>the implications of this cause I thought he was saying wrongly,</v>

5533
02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:04.430
<v Speaker 4>I thought he'd be saying,</v>

5534
02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:05.151
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5535
02:39:05.151 --> 02:39:08.720
<v Speaker 4>you've got this 13% of elite people at the top like you have me who get to have</v>

5536
02:39:08.721 --> 02:39:11.960
<v Speaker 4>jobs we love and then you've got everyone else's condemned to the shit.</v>

5537
02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:12.150
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5538
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.891
<v Speaker 4>I thought about my family.</v>

5539
02:39:12.891 --> 02:39:14.150
<v Speaker 4>My brother is an Uber driver.</v>

5540
02:39:14.151 --> 02:39:14.660
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

5541
02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:15.770
<v Speaker 4>my dad was a bus driver,</v>

5542
02:39:15.771 --> 02:39:16.970
<v Speaker 4>my grandmother cleaned toilets.</v>

5543
02:39:16.971 --> 02:39:17.151
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5544
02:39:17.151 --> 02:39:17.540
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

5545
02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:20.180
<v Speaker 4>are we saying they're just condemned to these miserable lives?</v>

5546
02:39:20.181 --> 02:39:23.210
<v Speaker 4>And explained to me it's not the work that makes you depressed,</v>

5547
02:39:23.211 --> 02:39:23.421
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5548
02:39:23.421 --> 02:39:26.450
<v Speaker 4>He's being controlled at work and there are solutions to that.</v>

5549
02:39:26.451 --> 02:39:27.620
<v Speaker 4>There are changes we can make.</v>

5550
02:39:27.621 --> 02:39:28.320
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5551
02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:28.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5552
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:33.620
<v Speaker 4>I went to interview this woman called Meredith Keough in Baltimore.</v>

5553
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.600
<v Speaker 4>It's been part of this really interesting change.</v>

5554
02:39:35.810 --> 02:39:38.090
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes some people listening are going to think I'm going to say they</v>

5555
02:39:38.091 --> 02:39:39.680
<v Speaker 4>should do this and they don't think I can't do that.</v>

5556
02:39:39.681 --> 02:39:40.101
<v Speaker 4>And it's right.</v>

5557
02:39:40.101 --> 02:39:41.210
<v Speaker 4>This is an argument or something else.</v>

5558
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:43.730
<v Speaker 4>So Meredith used to go to bed every Sunday night,</v>

5559
02:39:44.180 --> 02:39:45.590
<v Speaker 4>just sick with anxiety,</v>

5560
02:39:45.591 --> 02:39:46.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5561
02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5562
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:47.720
<v Speaker 4>she had an office job.</v>

5563
02:39:47.721 --> 02:39:50.000
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the worst office job in the world as she would tell Ya.</v>

5564
02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:52.280
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't being bullied or harassed or anything,</v>

5565
02:39:52.281 --> 02:39:54.020
<v Speaker 4>but it was boring.</v>

5566
02:39:54.050 --> 02:39:54.950
<v Speaker 4>It was controlled.</v>

5567
02:39:54.951 --> 02:39:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't just stand the thought.</v>

5568
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:59.360
<v Speaker 4>This was going to be the next 40 years of her life.</v>

5569
02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:00.860
<v Speaker 4>So one day with her husband,</v>

5570
02:40:00.861 --> 02:40:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Josh Meredith did this quite bold thing.</v>

5571
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5572
02:40:03.350 --> 02:40:03.831
<v Speaker 4>Josh,</v>

5573
02:40:03.831 --> 02:40:07.670
<v Speaker 4>her husband had been working in bike stores since he was a kid in Baltimore,</v>

5574
02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.180
<v Speaker 4>teenager and you know that's controlled work is insecure.</v>

5575
02:40:11.181 --> 02:40:12.920
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have rights really.</v>

5576
02:40:13.410 --> 02:40:16.440
<v Speaker 4>And one day Josh and his colleagues in the bike store and they ask themselves,</v>

5577
02:40:17.130 --> 02:40:18.510
<v Speaker 4>what does our boss actually do?</v>

5578
02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:20.131
<v Speaker 4>They liked their boss.</v>

5579
02:40:20.131 --> 02:40:20.970
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't a bad person,</v>

5580
02:40:20.971 --> 02:40:21.301
<v Speaker 4>but they were like,</v>

5581
02:40:21.301 --> 02:40:23.430
<v Speaker 4>we seem to fix all the bikes and he seems to make all the money.</v>

5582
02:40:23.431 --> 02:40:24.900
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't seem like such a good deal to me.</v>

5583
02:40:24.901 --> 02:40:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5584
02:40:25.530 --> 02:40:28.410
<v Speaker 4>So they decided they were going to set up a bike store that works on different</v>

5585
02:40:28.411 --> 02:40:28.861
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

5586
02:40:28.861 --> 02:40:29.310
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5587
02:40:29.310 --> 02:40:31.320
<v Speaker 4>The place they work before it was a corporation.</v>

5588
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Most people listening to your show work in corporations.</v>

5589
02:40:34.051 --> 02:40:36.300
<v Speaker 4>You know how it's a very recent human invention.</v>

5590
02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:37.950
<v Speaker 4>You know how it works as an army.</v>

5591
02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:40.080
<v Speaker 4>The boss at the top is like the little dictator.</v>

5592
02:40:40.081 --> 02:40:41.250
<v Speaker 4>You've got to obey him or leave,</v>

5593
02:40:41.251 --> 02:40:41.431
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5594
02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:44.400
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes he's a nice dictator and sometimes he's Kim Jong Un,</v>

5595
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:44.701
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

5596
02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:45.600
<v Speaker 4>you don't have much say over that.</v>

5597
02:40:45.601 --> 02:40:46.434
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5598
02:40:48.090 --> 02:40:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Josh and his colleagues decided to set up a bank store that works on a different</v>

5599
02:40:51.121 --> 02:40:51.954
<v Speaker 4>principle.</v>

5600
02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:53.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not a corporation,</v>

5601
02:40:53.131 --> 02:40:54.420
<v Speaker 4>it's a democratic cooperative.</v>

5602
02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:57.240
<v Speaker 4>So they don't have a boss.</v>

5603
02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:58.770
<v Speaker 4>They run the business together,</v>

5604
02:40:58.771 --> 02:41:00.090
<v Speaker 4>they take decisions about it together.</v>

5605
02:41:00.091 --> 02:41:02.100
<v Speaker 4>They have a meeting once every couple of weeks in practice.</v>

5606
02:41:02.101 --> 02:41:02.491
<v Speaker 4>They agree,</v>

5607
02:41:02.491 --> 02:41:03.241
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

5608
02:41:03.241 --> 02:41:04.440
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they don't and then they vote,</v>

5609
02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:06.120
<v Speaker 4>they share the profits,</v>

5610
02:41:06.450 --> 02:41:08.940
<v Speaker 4>they share out the good tasks and the shitty tasks.</v>

5611
02:41:09.330 --> 02:41:10.163
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5612
02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:11.760
<v Speaker 4>and one thing that was so interesting to me,</v>

5613
02:41:11.761 --> 02:41:13.520
<v Speaker 4>their businesses called Baltimore bicycle work,</v>

5614
02:41:13.521 --> 02:41:16.980
<v Speaker 4>spending time with them totally in line with professor moments.</v>

5615
02:41:16.981 --> 02:41:17.850
<v Speaker 4>Findings is,</v>

5616
02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:19.993
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5617
02:41:20.430 --> 02:41:24.720
<v Speaker 4>giving them back control over their work made the much less unhappy,</v>

5618
02:41:24.721 --> 02:41:25.201
<v Speaker 4>depressed,</v>

5619
02:41:25.201 --> 02:41:25.741
<v Speaker 4>and anxious.</v>

5620
02:41:25.741 --> 02:41:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5621
02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:27.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like,</v>

5622
02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:27.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5623
02:41:27.991 --> 02:41:31.140
<v Speaker 4>they quit their jobs fixing bikes and went off to become Beyonce is backing</v>

5624
02:41:31.141 --> 02:41:31.501
<v Speaker 4>singers,</v>

5625
02:41:31.501 --> 02:41:32.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5626
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:33.930
<v Speaker 4>They fix bikes before they fixed bikes.</v>

5627
02:41:33.930 --> 02:41:34.920
<v Speaker 4>Now differences.</v>

5628
02:41:34.921 --> 02:41:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Now they've got control over their work,</v>

5629
02:41:36.631 --> 02:41:37.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5630
02:41:37.290 --> 02:41:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Giving people back control over their work is a really powerful antidepressant</v>

5631
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:43.890
<v Speaker 4>that every corporation could be,</v>

5632
02:41:43.950 --> 02:41:45.450
<v Speaker 4>could be a democratic cooperative.</v>

5633
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:45.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5634
02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.310
<v Speaker 4>That's a big change in our society.</v>

5635
02:41:47.311 --> 02:41:47.641
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

5636
02:41:47.641 --> 02:41:47.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5637
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:50.070
<v Speaker 4>we've all lived through big changes in our society.</v>

5638
02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:51.330
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason,</v>

5639
02:41:52.210 --> 02:41:52.531
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

5640
02:41:52.531 --> 02:41:53.730
<v Speaker 4>it would be better for the economy.</v>

5641
02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5642
02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:58.020
<v Speaker 4>study at Cornell University found democratic workplaces grow on average four</v>

5643
02:41:58.021 --> 02:42:01.290
<v Speaker 4>times faster than non democratic workplaces because people are more committed.</v>

5644
02:42:01.291 --> 02:42:04.860
<v Speaker 4>They bringing more of their energy and their life to it that the,</v>

5645
02:42:06.910 --> 02:42:09.190
<v Speaker 4>we've got to understand Chris,</v>

5646
02:42:09.191 --> 02:42:10.720
<v Speaker 4>back to why the addiction is so bad.</v>

5647
02:42:10.721 --> 02:42:10.811
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5648
02:42:10.811 --> 02:42:15.811
<v Speaker 4>we can understand people who are showing these signs of distress,</v>

5649
02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:17.440
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>

5650
02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:18.130
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>

5651
02:42:18.130 --> 02:42:18.963
<v Speaker 4>addiction,</v>

5652
02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:22.990
<v Speaker 4>that they're doing that not because they're crazy.</v>

5653
02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:25.330
<v Speaker 4>There are some biological factors that are not rational,</v>

5654
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:30.750
<v Speaker 4>but mostly it's just actually we built a society that's not good for them and we</v>

5655
02:42:31.601 --> 02:42:35.400
<v Speaker 4>should be listening to that and respecting that and like the guy doctor in</v>

5656
02:42:35.410 --> 02:42:36.131
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam said to me,</v>

5657
02:42:36.131 --> 02:42:37.210
<v Speaker 4>listen to your nausea.</v>

5658
02:42:37.450 --> 02:42:38.860
<v Speaker 4>It will tell us what's wrong with you.</v>

5659
02:42:39.010 --> 02:42:43.690
<v Speaker 4>We should be listening to their nausea and using it as a kind of fuel to change,</v>

5660
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:48.330
<v Speaker 4>change the way we live in ways that will make or won't just make people who are</v>

5661
02:42:48.331 --> 02:42:49.450
<v Speaker 4>depressed and anxious and addictive.</v>

5662
02:42:49.451 --> 02:42:52.300
<v Speaker 4>Better off everyone's life will be better off if they control their work more.</v>

5663
02:42:52.301 --> 02:42:54.820
<v Speaker 4>If you go through some of the other big solutions to depression,</v>

5664
02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:56.080
<v Speaker 4>anxiety that I wrote about in,</v>

5665
02:42:56.410 --> 02:42:57.340
<v Speaker 4>in Las connections.</v>

5666
02:42:58.060 --> 02:43:00.520
<v Speaker 4>Now lost connections is your most recent book.</v>

5667
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5668
02:43:00.761 --> 02:43:01.600
<v Speaker 4>That's the one about depression.</v>

5669
02:43:01.601 --> 02:43:02.320
<v Speaker 4>Is that Audi?</v>

5670
02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:02.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5671
02:43:02.650 --> 02:43:02.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5672
02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:03.490
<v Speaker 4>They're both available.</v>

5673
02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:04.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5674
02:43:04.090 --> 02:43:05.650
<v Speaker 4>Now lost connections.</v>

5675
02:43:06.310 --> 02:43:07.960
<v Speaker 4>How did the two of them tie together?</v>

5676
02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:11.080
<v Speaker 4>So I wrote chasing the scream because of this addiction in my family.</v>

5677
02:43:11.890 --> 02:43:15.250
<v Speaker 4>And I go on this big journey all over the world to understand the drug war.</v>

5678
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.950
<v Speaker 4>And I set a line in my,</v>

5679
02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:19.840
<v Speaker 4>I did a Ted talk about it called a,</v>

5680
02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:21.520
<v Speaker 4>everything you think you know about addiction is wrong.</v>

5681
02:43:22.090 --> 02:43:23.380
<v Speaker 4>And I said a line in that,</v>

5682
02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 4>which is the opposite of addiction is connection.</v>

5683
02:43:24.911 --> 02:43:26.440
<v Speaker 4>I said earlier in our conversation</v>

5684
02:43:28.390 --> 02:43:29.470
<v Speaker 4>based on rat park,</v>

5685
02:43:29.471 --> 02:43:29.770
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5686
02:43:29.770 --> 02:43:31.540
<v Speaker 4>And lots of people started saying to me,</v>

5687
02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:33.451
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5688
02:43:33.451 --> 02:43:35.550
<v Speaker 4>are you just saying it's social isolation,</v>

5689
02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:36.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5690
02:43:36.420 --> 02:43:37.470
<v Speaker 4>Like loneliness.</v>

5691
02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:39.150
<v Speaker 4>And I very clearly in my moment,</v>

5692
02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:39.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5693
02:43:39.391 --> 02:43:41.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the lesson of rat park.</v>

5694
02:43:41.071 --> 02:43:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5695
02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's just what's going on in rat park.</v>

5696
02:43:43.141 --> 02:43:43.261
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5697
02:43:43.261 --> 02:43:45.570
<v Speaker 4>they don't have anything that makes life meaningful.</v>

5698
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Now Rats obviously much more,</v>

5699
02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:49.710
<v Speaker 4>much less complex than ours.</v>

5700
02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:50.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5701
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:51.420
<v Speaker 4>So I started thinking,</v>

5702
02:43:51.421 --> 02:43:51.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5703
02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:52.613
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

5704
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:56.840
<v Speaker 4>what is actually missing for people who are addicted,</v>

5705
02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:57.793
<v Speaker 4>depressed,</v>

5706
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.521
<v Speaker 4>anxious,</v>

5707
02:43:58.521 --> 02:44:00.200
<v Speaker 4>what is driving this crisis?</v>

5708
02:44:00.350 --> 02:44:02.540
<v Speaker 4>So I think that question that people kept asking me,</v>

5709
02:44:02.690 --> 02:44:06.440
<v Speaker 4>I could see the Portugal and Switzerland had dealt with some problems of</v>

5710
02:44:06.441 --> 02:44:06.981
<v Speaker 4>disconnection,</v>

5711
02:44:06.981 --> 02:44:08.390
<v Speaker 4>but you weren't quite rightly to think more question,</v>

5712
02:44:08.391 --> 02:44:08.900
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

5713
02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:10.310
<v Speaker 4>what did Switzerland deal with?</v>

5714
02:44:10.311 --> 02:44:10.571
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5715
02:44:10.571 --> 02:44:11.720
<v Speaker 4>That I couldn't quite,</v>

5716
02:44:11.721 --> 02:44:14.180
<v Speaker 4>I didn't quite ask cause it didn't quite understand when I was in Switzerland.</v>

5717
02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:18.170
<v Speaker 4>So I ended up again going on this big journey all over the world from a crazy</v>

5718
02:44:18.171 --> 02:44:21.110
<v Speaker 4>mixture of places like an Amish village in Indiana because the Amish have low</v>

5719
02:44:21.111 --> 02:44:25.290
<v Speaker 4>levels of depression to a lab in Baltimore where they're giving people suck</v>

5720
02:44:25.291 --> 02:44:30.291
<v Speaker 4>Adele links to your city in Brazil that banned advertising to see if that would</v>

5721
02:44:30.831 --> 02:44:31.700
<v Speaker 4>make them feel better.</v>

5722
02:44:32.150 --> 02:44:32.983
<v Speaker 4>Did it?</v>

5723
02:44:33.290 --> 02:44:34.123
<v Speaker 4>Which bear?</v>

5724
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.841
<v Speaker 4>Banning advertising.</v>

5725
02:44:34.841 --> 02:44:35.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5726
02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5727
02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:37.820
<v Speaker 4>So that's not been properly scientifically studied,</v>

5728
02:44:37.821 --> 02:44:40.400
<v Speaker 4>but there is a science that tells us it should explain what that is.</v>

5729
02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:41.563
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>

5730
02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:45.500
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows that junk food is taken over our diets and made us physically</v>

5731
02:44:45.501 --> 02:44:45.771
<v Speaker 4>sick,</v>

5732
02:44:45.771 --> 02:44:46.041
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5733
02:44:46.041 --> 02:44:48.380
<v Speaker 4>But there's this really interesting evidence,</v>

5734
02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:53.450
<v Speaker 4>the kind of junk values of taken over our minds and made us mentally sick.</v>

5735
02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:55.100
<v Speaker 4>So to thousands of years,</v>

5736
02:44:55.310 --> 02:44:56.450
<v Speaker 4>philosophers have said,</v>

5737
02:44:56.750 --> 02:45:01.610
<v Speaker 4>if you think life is about money and status and how you look to other people in</v>

5738
02:45:01.611 --> 02:45:02.720
<v Speaker 4>a kind of showing off way,</v>

5739
02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:04.070
<v Speaker 4>you're going to feel like shit,</v>

5740
02:45:04.071 --> 02:45:04.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5741
02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:05.810
<v Speaker 4>It's not an exact quote from Confucius,</v>

5742
02:45:05.811 --> 02:45:07.070
<v Speaker 4>but that is the gist of what he said,</v>

5743
02:45:07.071 --> 02:45:07.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5744
02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:08.810
<v Speaker 4>But weirdly,</v>

5745
02:45:09.260 --> 02:45:13.040
<v Speaker 4>nobody had ever scientifically investigated this until an incredible guy.</v>

5746
02:45:13.041 --> 02:45:16.610
<v Speaker 4>I got to know cut professor Tim [inaudible] who's at Knox College in Illinois,</v>

5747
02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:17.590
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5748
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:18.550
<v Speaker 4>and Professor Cassa,</v>

5749
02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:19.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5750
02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:22.610
<v Speaker 4>made some really important breakthroughs in this.</v>

5751
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:23.623
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

5752
02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:30.460
<v Speaker 4>there's two ways everyone listening to your show has two kinds of motivation in</v>

5753
02:45:30.681 --> 02:45:31.100
<v Speaker 4>their life,</v>

5754
02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:31.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5755
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:32.630
<v Speaker 4>We're all a mixture of both.</v>

5756
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:36.620
<v Speaker 4>So imagine if you played the piano in the morning cause you love playing the</v>

5757
02:45:36.621 --> 02:45:36.951
<v Speaker 4>piano.</v>

5758
02:45:36.951 --> 02:45:37.730
<v Speaker 4>It gives you joy,</v>

5759
02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:38.563
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5760
02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:41.330
<v Speaker 4>That would be what's called an intrinsic reason to play the piano,</v>

5761
02:45:41.331 --> 02:45:41.601
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5762
02:45:41.601 --> 02:45:42.950
<v Speaker 4>You're not doing it to get anything out of it.</v>

5763
02:45:42.951 --> 02:45:43.341
<v Speaker 4>That's just,</v>

5764
02:45:43.341 --> 02:45:44.180
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing you love.</v>

5765
02:45:44.181 --> 02:45:44.301
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5766
02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:47.420
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like Jujitsu was like that view writing is like that for me.</v>

5767
02:45:47.421 --> 02:45:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Everyone will have something in their life that just gives them joy as they do</v>

5768
02:45:50.601 --> 02:45:50.780
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

5769
02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:51.470
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5770
02:45:51.470 --> 02:45:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Can narrow imagine you played the piano,</v>

5771
02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:54.313
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

5772
02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.790
<v Speaker 4>I dunno not because you love it,</v>

5773
02:45:55.791 --> 02:45:58.940
<v Speaker 4>but because your parents are massively pressuring you.</v>

5774
02:45:58.941 --> 02:46:02.750
<v Speaker 4>It's their dream for you or in a dive bar that you can't stand to pay the rent</v>

5775
02:46:03.260 --> 02:46:04.610
<v Speaker 4>or cuts impress a woman.</v>

5776
02:46:04.730 --> 02:46:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5777
02:46:05.390 --> 02:46:08.240
<v Speaker 4>That would be what's called an extrinsic reasons to play the piano.</v>

5778
02:46:08.270 --> 02:46:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5779
02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:10.130
<v Speaker 4>You're not it cause that thing gives</v>

5780
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:10.371
<v Speaker 1>you joy.</v>

5781
02:46:10.371 --> 02:46:12.080
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it to get something further down the line.</v>

5782
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Right now obviously we're all a mixture of both,</v>

5783
02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:16.970
<v Speaker 1>but professor castle showed a couple of really interesting things.</v>

5784
02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:18.253
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

5785
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:21.380
<v Speaker 1>the more you are driven by extrinsic values,</v>

5786
02:46:21.381 --> 02:46:23.390
<v Speaker 1>the more your intrinsic values are starved,</v>

5787
02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:26.060
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious,</v>

5788
02:46:26.061 --> 02:46:27.530
<v Speaker 1>but quite significant amount.</v>

5789
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:30.350
<v Speaker 1>He also showed as a culture,</v>

5790
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:31.640
<v Speaker 1>as a society,</v>

5791
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.760
<v Speaker 1>we have become much more driven by these junk values.</v>

5792
02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5793
02:46:35.370 --> 02:46:38.870
<v Speaker 1>We've become much more driven by pick about how Instagram makes you feel.</v>

5794
02:46:38.871 --> 02:46:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

5795
02:46:39.171 --> 02:46:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5796
02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:44.160
<v Speaker 1>We've become much more driven by this hollow external sense of it.</v>

5797
02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Think about something as simple as,</v>

5798
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5799
02:46:46.330 --> 02:46:47.163
<v Speaker 1>a while ago,</v>

5800
02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:47.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5801
02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I was the Elton John's last night in Caesar's palace,</v>

5802
02:46:50.061 --> 02:46:50.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5803
02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Amazing thing to be at.</v>

5804
02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And about half the fucking room is,</v>

5805
02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:55.540
<v Speaker 1>is filming it on that isn't even looking out.</v>

5806
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:56.150
<v Speaker 1>And John,</v>

5807
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:57.590
<v Speaker 1>they're just watching it through their phone.</v>

5808
02:46:57.740 --> 02:46:57.861
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

5809
02:46:57.861 --> 02:46:59.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a small example,</v>

5810
02:46:59.270 --> 02:47:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but you can see what they're doing in order to display their life,</v>

5811
02:47:02.751 --> 02:47:04.580
<v Speaker 1>to invite envy from other people.</v>

5812
02:47:04.970 --> 02:47:06.320
<v Speaker 1>They are not living their life.</v>

5813
02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:08.450
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to watch your shitty video about.</v>

5814
02:47:08.451 --> 02:47:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And John,</v>

5815
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:11.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a hundred thousands of,</v>

5816
02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:11.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5817
02:47:11.450 --> 02:47:12.231
<v Speaker 1>of videos about,</v>

5818
02:47:12.231 --> 02:47:12.501
<v Speaker 1>and John,</v>

5819
02:47:12.501 --> 02:47:13.430
<v Speaker 1>they are much better than yours,</v>

5820
02:47:13.431 --> 02:47:13.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5821
02:47:13.970 --> 02:47:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>

5822
02:47:14.841 --> 02:47:15.950
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to watch it either.</v>

5823
02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.690
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it to say to other people,</v>

5824
02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:18.710
<v Speaker 1>envy me,</v>

5825
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:19.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5826
02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.160
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you feel good in that room actually makes you feel worse.</v>

5827
02:47:22.161 --> 02:47:25.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not enjoying the experience and it makes them feel like shit because</v>

5828
02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:27.980
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to invite envy and your friends.</v>

5829
02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:33.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a small example of a much wider thing of the kind of junk values of</v>

5830
02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.730
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>

5831
02:47:33.730 --> 02:47:37.310
<v Speaker 1>So the reason that relates to what you're asking about Brazil is professor</v>

5832
02:47:37.311 --> 02:47:41.750
<v Speaker 1>castle are shown those two sets of solutions to these junk values taken over our</v>

5833
02:47:41.751 --> 02:47:42.380
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

5834
02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:43.213
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

5835
02:47:43.250 --> 02:47:44.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like fucking air pollution,</v>

5836
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5837
02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:46.970
<v Speaker 1>get the messaging out of your head.</v>

5838
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:51.290
<v Speaker 1>More 18 month old children know what the Mcdonald's m means,</v>

5839
02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:52.850
<v Speaker 1>the know their own survey,</v>

5840
02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:53.720
<v Speaker 1>their own last name,</v>

5841
02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:54.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5842
02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:55.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5843
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:58.790
<v Speaker 1>from the moment it's professor [inaudible] put it to me from the moment we're</v>

5844
02:47:58.791 --> 02:47:59.570
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>

5845
02:47:59.570 --> 02:48:03.410
<v Speaker 1>we're immersed in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is</v>

5846
02:48:03.411 --> 02:48:04.640
<v Speaker 1>important about life,</v>

5847
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:05.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5848
02:48:05.390 --> 02:48:09.680
<v Speaker 1>None of your listeners will lie on their death beds and think about all the shit</v>

5849
02:48:09.681 --> 02:48:11.840
<v Speaker 1>they bought and all the likes they got an Instagram.</v>

5850
02:48:11.841 --> 02:48:13.430
<v Speaker 1>They'll think about moments and meaning and connection.</v>

5851
02:48:13.431 --> 02:48:14.241
<v Speaker 1>That's like a banal,</v>

5852
02:48:14.241 --> 02:48:15.074
<v Speaker 1>obvious thing,</v>

5853
02:48:15.170 --> 02:48:18.650
<v Speaker 1>but we're constantly pushed to not think in those terms,</v>

5854
02:48:18.651 --> 02:48:19.430
<v Speaker 1>to think about,</v>

5855
02:48:19.430 --> 02:48:21.290
<v Speaker 1>show it off by spend,</v>

5856
02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:21.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5857
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:24.110
<v Speaker 1>These junk values have taken over our minds.</v>

5858
02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:27.620
<v Speaker 1>So part of the solution is just fucking get rid of most of this advertising,</v>

5859
02:48:27.621 --> 02:48:28.880
<v Speaker 1>get rid of most of this,</v>

5860
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5861
02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:30.900
<v Speaker 1>very tightly regulated.</v>

5862
02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:32.900
<v Speaker 1>But in doing so,</v>

5863
02:48:32.901 --> 02:48:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you limit commerce,</v>

5864
02:48:34.071 --> 02:48:37.130
<v Speaker 1>you're limiting people's ability to sell things.</v>

5865
02:48:37.330 --> 02:48:37.710
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

5866
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you're changing the,</v>

5867
02:48:38.861 --> 02:48:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the current market that a lot of people don't have any problem with.</v>

5868
02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a heresy in the United States,</v>

5869
02:48:43.551 --> 02:48:45.950
<v Speaker 1>but I limits in commercial speech is fine by me.</v>

5870
02:48:45.951 --> 02:48:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5871
02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

5872
02:48:46.330 --> 02:48:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fascinating.</v>

5873
02:48:47.451 --> 02:48:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fascinating discussion but it is in the,</v>

5874
02:48:49.281 --> 02:48:51.230
<v Speaker 1>in a sense it's limiting free speech as well.</v>

5875
02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5876
02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:53.060
<v Speaker 1>and we have a real problem with that.</v>

5877
02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:56.930
<v Speaker 1>The problem with it is that as soon as you start to put any regulations at all</v>

5878
02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:57.711
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

5879
02:48:57.711 --> 02:48:58.101
<v Speaker 1>he say,</v>

5880
02:48:58.101 --> 02:48:58.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5881
02:48:58.251 --> 02:49:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be allowed to advertising to advertise,</v>

5882
02:49:00.771 --> 02:49:01.820
<v Speaker 1>even if it's advertising.</v>

5883
02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Honestly about a great product that people were,</v>

5884
02:49:04.791 --> 02:49:06.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll have real issues with that.</v>

5885
02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:08.400
<v Speaker 1>We already have advertising regulation.</v>

5886
02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:09.320
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat,</v>

5887
02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't pop an advert saying I've found the cure for cancer.</v>

5888
02:49:12.650 --> 02:49:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5889
02:49:12.930 --> 02:49:13.763
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

5890
02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:15.230
<v Speaker 1>So this is still,</v>

5891
02:49:15.270 --> 02:49:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I would argue this as a tightening.</v>

5892
02:49:16.471 --> 02:49:16.651
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5893
02:49:16.651 --> 02:49:17.131
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

5894
02:49:17.131 --> 02:49:18.990
<v Speaker 1>in London there was a big controversy,</v>

5895
02:49:19.390 --> 02:49:19.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5896
02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:20.680
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years back.</v>

5897
02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:21.513
<v Speaker 1>Any billboards.</v>

5898
02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:22.171
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5899
02:49:22.171 --> 02:49:23.004
<v Speaker 1>So it was this,</v>

5900
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:28.070
<v Speaker 1>it was a billboard of a impossibly hot women and impossibly hot man and the</v>

5901
02:49:28.411 --> 02:49:29.670
<v Speaker 1>billboards had something like,</v>

5902
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:31.380
<v Speaker 1>are you beach body ready?</v>

5903
02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:32.610
<v Speaker 1>The clear implication being,</v>

5904
02:49:32.611 --> 02:49:35.340
<v Speaker 1>if you don't look like these people who you'll never fucking look like you're</v>

5905
02:49:35.341 --> 02:49:36.570
<v Speaker 1>not ready to go to the beach.</v>

5906
02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And the mayor of London City can just said this,</v>

5907
02:49:38.930 --> 02:49:39.631
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this.</v>

5908
02:49:39.631 --> 02:49:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5909
02:49:40.350 --> 02:49:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You can still advertise your bodybuilding.</v>

5910
02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:43.440
<v Speaker 1>That's so silly.</v>

5911
02:49:43.441 --> 02:49:43.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5912
02:49:43.741 --> 02:49:44.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

5913
02:49:44.581 --> 02:49:46.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not an unobtainable ideal.</v>

5914
02:49:46.561 --> 02:49:48.030
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at two examples of it,</v>

5915
02:49:48.330 --> 02:49:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

5916
02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:49.950
<v Speaker 1>they're real human beings.</v>

5917
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5918
02:49:50.251 --> 02:49:51.084
<v Speaker 1>But that's like,</v>

5919
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:51.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5920
02:49:51.361 --> 02:49:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I know when I started listening,</v>

5921
02:49:52.801 --> 02:49:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not saying that you have to be that way,</v>

5922
02:49:55.350 --> 02:49:58.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you do want to look like that man and have that body,</v>

5923
02:49:58.891 --> 02:50:00.480
<v Speaker 1>it is a possible goal.</v>

5924
02:50:01.310 --> 02:50:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5925
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not possible for the vast majority of people,</v>

5926
02:50:03.810 --> 02:50:04.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5927
02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Like if they don't have the time or the effort,</v>

5928
02:50:06.661 --> 02:50:07.494
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

5929
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but very many people have radically changed their body.</v>

5930
02:50:11.161 --> 02:50:11.994
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>

5931
02:50:12.930 --> 02:50:14.160
<v Speaker 1>not saying you should do it,</v>

5932
02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:15.930
<v Speaker 1>this is a possible thing to do.</v>

5933
02:50:15.931 --> 02:50:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you're trying to sell fitness,</v>

5934
02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:20.730
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you sell an example of someone who's really good at it?</v>

5935
02:50:20.850 --> 02:50:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're trying to sell a business course,</v>

5936
02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.070
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you show a guy with a giant house and a Ferrari?</v>

5937
02:50:26.250 --> 02:50:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a guy who has done really well at business,</v>

5938
02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:31.560
<v Speaker 1>look at his penthouse apartment overlooking Manhattan.</v>

5939
02:50:31.890 --> 02:50:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't show,</v>

5940
02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:33.091
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't say,</v>

5941
02:50:33.091 --> 02:50:34.740
<v Speaker 1>well that's an impossible goal.</v>

5942
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a person in a middle class suburb because this is as good</v>

5943
02:50:37.651 --> 02:50:38.484
<v Speaker 1>as you're ever going to get.</v>

5944
02:50:38.850 --> 02:50:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a fair point.</v>

5945
02:50:39.870 --> 02:50:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's two things going on,</v>

5946
02:50:40.801 --> 02:50:41.610
<v Speaker 1>isn't there?</v>

5947
02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:42.443
<v Speaker 1>There's</v>

5948
02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:45.540
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of people to market what they want to do.</v>

5949
02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5950
02:50:46.270 --> 02:50:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

5951
02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:47.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5952
02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:51.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a nanny state issue that people have a problem with you by saying that</v>

5953
02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:54.480
<v Speaker 1>these are impossible to achieve body goals.</v>

5954
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:59.400
<v Speaker 1>We already have regulation at these things and people don't call that and nanny</v>

5955
02:50:59.401 --> 02:50:59.701
<v Speaker 1>state thing.</v>

5956
02:50:59.701 --> 02:51:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I think just this idea have regulation,</v>

5957
02:51:02.701 --> 02:51:03.061
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

5958
02:51:03.061 --> 02:51:03.531
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

5959
02:51:03.531 --> 02:51:04.410
<v Speaker 1>that is not,</v>

5960
02:51:04.430 --> 02:51:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

5961
02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is a good example.</v>

5962
02:51:07.210 --> 02:51:08.130
<v Speaker 1>What's a better example?</v>

5963
02:51:08.131 --> 02:51:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So professor Cassa said there's two sets of solutions to these junk valley's</v>

5964
02:51:10.681 --> 02:51:11.514
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

5965
02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:12.150
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

5966
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.983
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5967
02:51:13.350 --> 02:51:15.780
<v Speaker 1>get the contaminants out of the atmosphere sort of thing,</v>

5968
02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:19.470
<v Speaker 1>which he says is actually a weaker one than the second set of solution says.</v>

5969
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So how do we stop people being pumped full of bullshit,</v>

5970
02:51:22.021 --> 02:51:22.741
<v Speaker 1>junk values,</v>

5971
02:51:22.741 --> 02:51:22.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5972
02:51:22.981 --> 02:51:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Educate them on what is happening to them and make it less appealing.</v>

5973
02:51:26.190 --> 02:51:26.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5974
02:51:26.341 --> 02:51:29.610
<v Speaker 1>this is the second part and you've gotten to what I think was the most important</v>

5975
02:51:29.611 --> 02:51:30.241
<v Speaker 1>part of the research.</v>

5976
02:51:30.241 --> 02:51:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Professor Cassa did see,</v>

5977
02:51:31.770 --> 02:51:35.970
<v Speaker 1>he was working with a guy called Nathan Dungan and Nathan is a hearing to be,</v>

5978
02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:36.833
<v Speaker 1>Nathan is a</v>

5979
02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:40.020
<v Speaker 1>financial advisor in Minneapolis.</v>

5980
02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And his job was to work with,</v>

5981
02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:43.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5982
02:51:43.110 --> 02:51:46.920
<v Speaker 1>adults who are having trouble budgeting and explain budgeting to them and help</v>

5983
02:51:46.921 --> 02:51:47.754
<v Speaker 1>them do it right.</v>

5984
02:51:48.270 --> 02:51:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And it gets a cool from a school,</v>

5985
02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of middle class school wasn't super rich or poor.</v>

5986
02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a middle class.</v>

5987
02:51:54.740 --> 02:51:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5988
02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:57.240
<v Speaker 1>whether they're having a problem that the kids at this school,</v>

5989
02:51:57.241 --> 02:52:00.480
<v Speaker 1>we're becoming obsessed with getting like the latest Nike sneakers or the latest</v>

5990
02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:01.650
<v Speaker 1>iPhone or whatever it was.</v>

5991
02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And if their parents couldn't afford it,</v>

5992
02:52:03.211 --> 02:52:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the kids were really freaking out.</v>

5993
02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5994
02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 1>So they cite to</v>

5995
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Nathan,</v>

5996
02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:09.040
<v Speaker 4>would you come in and just explain budgeting to these kids?</v>

5997
02:52:09.041 --> 02:52:09.874
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5998
02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:10.270
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5999
02:52:10.270 --> 02:52:12.940
<v Speaker 4>and I think Isaiah and he tries to explain budgeting and quickly realize is</v>

6000
02:52:12.941 --> 02:52:14.290
<v Speaker 4>these kids don't give a shit about budgetary,</v>

6001
02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:14.501
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6002
02:52:14.501 --> 02:52:15.610
<v Speaker 4>There's something else going on here.</v>

6003
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:17.770
<v Speaker 4>They are so obsessed with getting these things.</v>

6004
02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:19.060
<v Speaker 4>So with Professor Cassa,</v>

6005
02:52:19.061 --> 02:52:23.020
<v Speaker 4>he designs this program that led to really interesting breakthrough.</v>

6006
02:52:23.290 --> 02:52:24.460
<v Speaker 4>It's saying people can try at home,</v>

6007
02:52:24.461 --> 02:52:24.611
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6008
02:52:24.611 --> 02:52:25.870
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to do it in this context.</v>

6009
02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:28.150
<v Speaker 4>So they'd got,</v>

6010
02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:29.740
<v Speaker 4>and you can do it just as adults,</v>

6011
02:52:29.741 --> 02:52:31.060
<v Speaker 4>but they did it with uh,</v>

6012
02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:32.320
<v Speaker 4>parents and the teenagers,</v>

6013
02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:33.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6014
02:52:33.010 --> 02:52:33.581
<v Speaker 4>They come in,</v>

6015
02:52:33.581 --> 02:52:35.440
<v Speaker 4>it was once every couple of weeks for think,</v>

6016
02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:37.570
<v Speaker 4>four months and a fast.</v>

6017
02:52:37.571 --> 02:52:39.400
<v Speaker 4>They just say the first meeting they had,</v>

6018
02:52:39.401 --> 02:52:40.234
<v Speaker 4>they just said,</v>

6019
02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:43.360
<v Speaker 4>write a list of everything you have got to have.</v>

6020
02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:44.253
<v Speaker 4>They didn't define that.</v>

6021
02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6022
02:52:44.830 --> 02:52:46.780
<v Speaker 4>And people of course say like a home,</v>

6023
02:52:46.781 --> 02:52:47.201
<v Speaker 4>a car,</v>

6024
02:52:47.201 --> 02:52:47.800
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

6025
02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:49.930
<v Speaker 4>But quite quickly people would say Nike sneakers,</v>

6026
02:52:49.931 --> 02:52:52.270
<v Speaker 4>the parents would name expensive things and they got,</v>

6027
02:52:52.271 --> 02:52:52.720
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6028
02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:55.630
<v Speaker 4>tell me how you would feel if you got these Nike sneakers.</v>

6029
02:52:55.631 --> 02:52:56.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6030
02:52:56.350 --> 02:52:57.970
<v Speaker 4>And very rarely I only,</v>

6031
02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.350
<v Speaker 4>any of them were like basketball players,</v>

6032
02:52:59.351 --> 02:52:59.651
<v Speaker 4>so it was like,</v>

6033
02:52:59.651 --> 02:53:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I need the jump or whatever,</v>

6034
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.823
<v Speaker 4>if that's the right phrase.</v>

6035
02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:03.933
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6036
02:53:04.090 --> 02:53:05.160
<v Speaker 4>it was very low for ob.</v>

6037
02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:05.921
<v Speaker 4>Almost immediately it's,</v>

6038
02:53:05.921 --> 02:53:07.210
<v Speaker 4>I'd be accepted by the group.</v>

6039
02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:08.290
<v Speaker 4>People would envy me.</v>

6040
02:53:08.350 --> 02:53:09.100
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6041
02:53:09.100 --> 02:53:09.610
<v Speaker 4>These days,</v>

6042
02:53:09.610 --> 02:53:11.440
<v Speaker 4>insights are just beneath the surface where they go,</v>

6043
02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:13.150
<v Speaker 4>who put the idea in your head,</v>

6044
02:53:13.180 --> 02:53:14.470
<v Speaker 4>where did you get that idea?</v>

6045
02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:16.900
<v Speaker 4>And of course everyone thinks they're smarter than the ad,</v>

6046
02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:20.890
<v Speaker 4>but giving people the ability just to see how hollow those junk values,</v>

6047
02:53:20.891 --> 02:53:21.760
<v Speaker 4>where that was the first part,</v>

6048
02:53:22.030 --> 02:53:24.850
<v Speaker 4>second part was much more interesting and took longer than I would have in</v>

6049
02:53:24.851 --> 02:53:25.391
<v Speaker 4>future sessions.</v>

6050
02:53:25.391 --> 02:53:26.080
<v Speaker 4>They'd say,</v>

6051
02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:26.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6052
02:53:26.770 --> 02:53:27.040
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6053
02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:28.870
<v Speaker 4>given that not actually made you feel better,</v>

6054
02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:32.110
<v Speaker 4>what are moments in your life when you have felt satisfied,</v>

6055
02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:33.730
<v Speaker 4>happy in a flow state?</v>

6056
02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.220
<v Speaker 4>What are things that are meaningful to you or people you know,</v>

6057
02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.090
<v Speaker 4>a whole range of things.</v>

6058
02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:40.660
<v Speaker 4>Playing sports or play music or reading,</v>

6059
02:53:40.661 --> 02:53:41.231
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

6060
02:53:41.231 --> 02:53:42.064
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

6061
02:53:42.250 --> 02:53:42.521
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

6062
02:53:42.521 --> 02:53:42.760
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6063
02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:47.560
<v Speaker 4>how could we build more of that into your life and less of these junk values?</v>

6064
02:53:47.561 --> 02:53:50.260
<v Speaker 4>How could you do more of this every week and just meeting?</v>

6065
02:53:50.270 --> 02:53:52.210
<v Speaker 4>We don't have these conversations in our culture very often.</v>

6066
02:53:52.450 --> 02:53:55.640
<v Speaker 4>Just meeting once every couple of weeks and checking in with HR and go,</v>

6067
02:53:55.641 --> 02:53:55.961
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

6068
02:53:55.961 --> 02:53:58.000
<v Speaker 4>I managed to play guitar for an hour every day.</v>

6069
02:53:58.420 --> 02:54:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I managed on Saturday to take my kids to the beach and we went,</v>

6070
02:54:01.290 --> 02:54:01.720
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

6071
02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:03.280
<v Speaker 4>It's going to stifle materialism.</v>

6072
02:54:03.790 --> 02:54:04.601
<v Speaker 4>What it led to,</v>

6073
02:54:04.601 --> 02:54:06.400
<v Speaker 4>sepsis is monitored by Professor Cassar.</v>

6074
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:09.670
<v Speaker 4>It led to a significant shifts in people's values that they,</v>

6075
02:54:09.730 --> 02:54:09.991
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

6076
02:54:09.991 --> 02:54:10.330
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

6077
02:54:10.330 --> 02:54:14.350
<v Speaker 4>they had a significant decrease in junk ponies and a significant increase in,</v>

6078
02:54:14.590 --> 02:54:17.830
<v Speaker 4>in a more meaningful intrinsic values.</v>

6079
02:54:18.130 --> 02:54:21.880
<v Speaker 4>And we know that that correlates with lower depression and anxiety over time.</v>

6080
02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:25.150
<v Speaker 4>The weird thing is I sometimes feel like with all my,</v>

6081
02:54:25.210 --> 02:54:26.110
<v Speaker 4>we both my books chasing,</v>

6082
02:54:26.111 --> 02:54:26.381
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>

6083
02:54:26.381 --> 02:54:26.681
<v Speaker 4>lost connection.</v>

6084
02:54:26.681 --> 02:54:30.310
<v Speaker 4>So I sometimes feel like I'm giving people permission to know the thing they</v>

6085
02:54:30.311 --> 02:54:31.144
<v Speaker 4>already know,</v>

6086
02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:31.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6087
02:54:31.930 --> 02:54:35.920
<v Speaker 4>Like had this a completely bizarre experience when the book first came out,</v>

6088
02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:39.400
<v Speaker 4>why was being lost connections that depression one where I was being interviewed</v>

6089
02:54:39.401 --> 02:54:41.080
<v Speaker 4>by some American inns of your heart.</v>

6090
02:54:41.090 --> 02:54:41.923
<v Speaker 4>My heart was,</v>

6091
02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:43.473
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

6092
02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:45.700
<v Speaker 4>I talk about how loneliness causes depression,</v>

6093
02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:46.773
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6094
02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:48.400
<v Speaker 4>And the interviewer goes saying like,</v>

6095
02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:49.361
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6096
02:54:49.361 --> 02:54:51.130
<v Speaker 4>this is a very controversial theory.</v>

6097
02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:53.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of sitting there and I thought,</v>

6098
02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:55.990
<v Speaker 4>how did we get to the point?</v>

6099
02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:59.740
<v Speaker 4>We're pointing out the most fucking obvious thing you can imagine that if you're</v>

6100
02:54:59.741 --> 02:55:00.431
<v Speaker 4>really lonely,</v>

6101
02:55:00.431 --> 02:55:02.980
<v Speaker 4>are much more likely to become dollar loans as controversial at all.</v>

6102
02:55:03.050 --> 02:55:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Think that person's silly.</v>

6103
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I think the reason it's controversial is because these biological stories,</v>

6104
02:55:10.010 --> 02:55:11.360
<v Speaker 4>which have some truth in them,</v>

6105
02:55:11.810 --> 02:55:14.030
<v Speaker 4>have dominated how when I was a teenager,</v>

6106
02:55:14.031 --> 02:55:14.680
<v Speaker 4>I went to,</v>

6107
02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:18.320
<v Speaker 4>it's only thought of as being exactly when I went to my doctor when I was a</v>

6108
02:55:18.321 --> 02:55:22.220
<v Speaker 4>teenager and I was really depressed and I said I had this feeling like pain was</v>

6109
02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:24.080
<v Speaker 4>leaking out of me and I couldn't control it.</v>

6110
02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:25.220
<v Speaker 4>My doctor told me,</v>

6111
02:55:25.221 --> 02:55:26.750
<v Speaker 4>and entirely biological teacher said,</v>

6112
02:55:26.930 --> 02:55:30.220
<v Speaker 4>there's just a problem with your brain here and all you need to do is drug</v>

6113
02:55:30.221 --> 02:55:30.741
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

6114
02:55:30.741 --> 02:55:31.021
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6115
02:55:31.021 --> 02:55:31.340
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6116
02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:33.890
<v Speaker 4>And I drug myself and I've got some relief from the chemical antidepressants,</v>

6117
02:55:33.891 --> 02:55:35.390
<v Speaker 4>but it did not solve my depression.</v>

6118
02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:38.570
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons I wrote lost connections is cause after 13 years of</v>

6119
02:55:38.571 --> 02:55:39.840
<v Speaker 4>taking the maximum possible dose,</v>

6120
02:55:39.841 --> 02:55:40.550
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

6121
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.731
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6122
02:55:40.731 --> 02:55:41.540
<v Speaker 4>what's going wrong here?</v>

6123
02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:44.540
<v Speaker 4>There's something missing in this picture cause I still feel depressed.</v>

6124
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:46.190
<v Speaker 4>And every year that I've been alive,</v>

6125
02:55:46.191 --> 02:55:49.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm 40 depression and anxiety have increased in the United States,</v>

6126
02:55:49.761 --> 02:55:50.091
<v Speaker 4>in Britain,</v>

6127
02:55:50.091 --> 02:55:50.960
<v Speaker 4>and across the Western world.</v>

6128
02:55:51.170 --> 02:55:52.550
<v Speaker 4>There's something missing in this picture.</v>

6129
02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:55.010
<v Speaker 4>And I think the reason why that's controversial,</v>

6130
02:55:55.310 --> 02:55:56.660
<v Speaker 4>it seemed controversial that women,</v>

6131
02:55:56.661 --> 02:55:57.471
<v Speaker 4>even though to you and me,</v>

6132
02:55:57.471 --> 02:55:59.960
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy to think it's controversial,</v>

6133
02:56:00.470 --> 02:56:03.890
<v Speaker 4>is because these biological stories which have some basis in reality,</v>

6134
02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:06.500
<v Speaker 4>have become the whole of the picture for a lot of people.</v>

6135
02:56:06.501 --> 02:56:07.334
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6136
02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:10.250
<v Speaker 4>I had a completely bizarre experience where,</v>

6137
02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:12.070
<v Speaker 4>you know Peter Taylor,</v>

6138
02:56:12.071 --> 02:56:12.904
<v Speaker 4>have you had him on your show?</v>

6139
02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:13.431
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6140
02:56:13.431 --> 02:56:14.120
<v Speaker 4>but I know him.</v>

6141
02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:14.361
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

6142
02:56:14.361 --> 02:56:18.350
<v Speaker 4>A pizza tell people who don't know is the founder of paypal gazillionaire right.</v>

6143
02:56:18.351 --> 02:56:19.370
<v Speaker 4>Back to the Trump campaign.</v>

6144
02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:24.170
<v Speaker 4>I got an invitation from Peter Teal just before it was after Trump had been</v>

6145
02:56:24.171 --> 02:56:24.471
<v Speaker 4>elected,</v>

6146
02:56:24.471 --> 02:56:29.000
<v Speaker 4>but before he'd been inaugurated his people to go to a,</v>

6147
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:34.030
<v Speaker 4>they were organizing a conference for APP developers who are trying to develop</v>

6148
02:56:36.171 --> 02:56:37.220
<v Speaker 4>apps to deal with depression,</v>

6149
02:56:37.221 --> 02:56:38.210
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and addiction.</v>

6150
02:56:38.210 --> 02:56:38.811
<v Speaker 4>And I'm a bit like,</v>

6151
02:56:38.811 --> 02:56:40.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't think apps are really the solution,</v>

6152
02:56:40.101 --> 02:56:42.980
<v Speaker 4>but I wanted an excuse to go to San Francisco anyway,</v>

6153
02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:44.113
<v Speaker 4>so I go,</v>

6154
02:56:44.930 --> 02:56:46.430
<v Speaker 4>so day long conference,</v>

6155
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:48.170
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hit every speech,</v>

6156
02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:50.240
<v Speaker 4>but some really great scientists,</v>

6157
02:56:50.241 --> 02:56:52.790
<v Speaker 4>people like Thomas and saw who was the former head of the National Institute of</v>

6158
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Health,</v>

6159
02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:54.940
<v Speaker 4>who's hugely armor man.</v>

6160
02:56:55.580 --> 02:56:57.860
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sitting there and I'm like,</v>

6161
02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:01.970
<v Speaker 4>all they're doing is looking at pictures of brain scans.</v>

6162
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:02.983
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6163
02:57:03.140 --> 02:57:08.030
<v Speaker 4>If all you knew about depression and anxiety was this conference and addiction,</v>

6164
02:57:08.450 --> 02:57:11.000
<v Speaker 4>you would literally think they were just things that happen inside the brain.</v>

6165
02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

6166
02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:12.950
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like the last person up,</v>

6167
02:57:12.951 --> 02:57:14.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this was designed this way.</v>

6168
02:57:14.031 --> 02:57:14.864
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they did.</v>

6169
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that I'm thinking,</v>

6170
02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:17.660
<v Speaker 4>what do I say to these people?</v>

6171
02:57:17.661 --> 02:57:18.494
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

6172
02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:19.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6173
02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:22.640
<v Speaker 4>it's like I was trying to get metaphors.</v>

6174
02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:26.300
<v Speaker 4>You could have a conference about obesity that just looked at scans of people's</v>

6175
02:57:26.301 --> 02:57:26.841
<v Speaker 4>stomachs,</v>

6176
02:57:26.841 --> 02:57:27.674
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6177
02:57:27.770 --> 02:57:28.670
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be untrue.</v>

6178
02:57:28.671 --> 02:57:29.990
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be bad science,</v>

6179
02:57:30.170 --> 02:57:31.970
<v Speaker 4>but had missed the whole fucking reason why they're fat.</v>

6180
02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:32.301
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

6181
02:57:32.301 --> 02:57:32.660
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

6182
02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:33.230
<v Speaker 4>But you could,</v>

6183
02:57:33.230 --> 02:57:37.640
<v Speaker 4>you could tell the plot of Romeo and Juliet using like Newtonian physics.</v>

6184
02:57:37.641 --> 02:57:38.510
<v Speaker 4>You could draw a diagram.</v>

6185
02:57:38.511 --> 02:57:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Romeo moves this way,</v>

6186
02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:40.633
<v Speaker 4>Juliet,</v>

6187
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:43.790
<v Speaker 4>you won't understand a re a damn thing about why anyone does anything.</v>

6188
02:57:43.791 --> 02:57:44.624
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6189
02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:49.910
<v Speaker 4>It was such a deep misunderstanding or not misunderstanding such a partial</v>

6190
02:57:49.911 --> 02:57:50.331
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>

6191
02:57:50.331 --> 02:57:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6192
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:51.530
<v Speaker 4>And I said to them,</v>

6193
02:57:51.530 --> 02:57:53.660
<v Speaker 4>so we were in San Francisco where we're really near the tenderloin,</v>

6194
02:57:53.661 --> 02:57:55.220
<v Speaker 4>which helps the people knows a place,</v>

6195
02:57:55.221 --> 02:57:56.630
<v Speaker 4>a lot of chaotic straight addiction.</v>

6196
02:57:56.810 --> 02:57:57.643
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6197
02:57:58.220 --> 02:57:59.060
<v Speaker 4>let's not discuss this.</v>

6198
02:57:59.061 --> 02:58:00.830
<v Speaker 4>Let's all just walk over to the tenderloin,</v>

6199
02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:03.330
<v Speaker 4>sit with the first person with an addiction problem.</v>

6200
02:58:03.331 --> 02:58:04.164
<v Speaker 4>We meet,</v>

6201
02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:08.070
<v Speaker 4>listened to their life story for half an hour and come back and tell me the main</v>

6202
02:58:08.071 --> 02:58:08.990
<v Speaker 4>problem here is,</v>

6203
02:58:09.070 --> 02:58:10.710
<v Speaker 4>is a malfunction of the Amygdala.</v>

6204
02:58:11.010 --> 02:58:13.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a bizarre misunderstand that.</v>

6205
02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Is there something going on with making lists?</v>

6206
02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

6207
02:58:15.810 --> 02:58:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Is it important to understand that science,</v>

6208
02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:18.391
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

6209
02:58:18.391 --> 02:58:18.631
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6210
02:58:18.631 --> 02:58:20.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm strongly in favor of brain science.</v>

6211
02:58:20.310 --> 02:58:22.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm in favor of the science of understanding the stomach.</v>

6212
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:28.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a bizarre reduction of what human beings are to think that these are the</v>

6213
02:58:28.381 --> 02:58:30.540
<v Speaker 4>main drivers of these crises.</v>

6214
02:58:30.541 --> 02:58:31.374
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6215
02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:32.850
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

6216
02:58:34.170 --> 02:58:35.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6217
02:58:35.130 --> 02:58:35.411
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

6218
02:58:35.411 --> 02:58:36.030
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

6219
02:58:36.030 --> 02:58:37.050
<v Speaker 4>And we have to wrap this up.</v>

6220
02:58:37.051 --> 02:58:38.820
<v Speaker 4>Were were already after I really drove the truck.</v>

6221
02:58:38.821 --> 02:58:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Can I just say very quickly that anyone who wants any more in from a publishers</v>

6226
02:58:51.781 --> 02:58:54.330
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about and take a quiz to see how much you know about addiction and</v>

6227
02:58:54.331 --> 02:58:58.620
<v Speaker 4>loss connections is www.thelosconnections.com and there are audiobooks are both</v>
