1
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>dude of history came back.</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>If history struck back,</v>

4
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>do we would,</v>

5
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't make it.</v>

6
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.113
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

7
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't make it long.</v>

8
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.651
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

9
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:11.484
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fine.</v>

10
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>People are adaptable.</v>

11
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.801
<v Speaker 1>You're smart,</v>

12
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:14.041
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

13
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Theo Vaughn,</v>

14
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.241
<v Speaker 1>I would lead,</v>

15
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.021
<v Speaker 1>I would think a little bit.</v>

16
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I would adapt.</v>

17
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I'd lay low in the beginning.</v>

18
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>like somebody doesn't pick my battles.</v>

20
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

21
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to kill somebody immediately.</v>

22
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to find the first person in your group.</v>

23
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>The week is person and kill them in front of everybody else.</v>

24
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to do that,</v>

26
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the person wouldn't have to be either a terrible person who is victimizing other</v>

27
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>people or they would,</v>

28
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>have to have attacked first who'd have to be,</v>

30
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>or they would have to been such a piece of shit that people were rooting for</v>

31
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

32
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody who was real chatty and you just ask them,</v>

33
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

34
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>

35
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of trying to survive like,</v>

36
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.463
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

38
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the second coming of of the universe and some dudes chatty and my group,</v>

40
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

41
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.223
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

43
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.081
<v Speaker 1>especially with like,</v>

44
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>he fucks up some hunting parties.</v>

45
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>You're out there like sneaking up on a pig and he's like,</v>

46
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.641
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

47
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>it's so hot out.</v>

48
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>You fucking the pig runs away and everybody's hungry.</v>

49
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Chatty would be the first man I think about that kind of stuff.</v>

50
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Like if a plane crash,</v>

51
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I already know I'm planning ahead.</v>

52
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Did I'd eat a Vietnamese guy.</v>

53
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.573
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

54
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's easier to start or move.</v>

55
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>If you attack somebody bigger,</v>

56
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>he eat somebody bigger in front of other people.</v>

57
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>It's going to alarm people.</v>

58
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>You got to eat a small person.</v>

59
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So stature is important.</v>

60
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I think if you come down a Viet people aren't going to be that upset at you.</v>

61
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

62
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>The Vietnamese people are going to be super.</v>

63
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So what are you talking about?</v>

64
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Somebody whose dad,</v>

65
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>they're more understanding of things.</v>

66
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

67
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a character you're playing.</v>

68
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.113
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

69
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>but if you eat a black dude,</v>

70
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you eat a black lady and her family is there,</v>

71
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be pissed.</v>

72
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>So you think it Vietnamese person and we'll let you slide.</v>

73
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that they'd be much more forgiving over a couple of day period.</v>

74
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.281
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

75
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>like our relatives.</v>

77
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think there'd be super pissed at you.</v>

78
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>But what is interesting is like Vietnam was one of the few places where</v>

79
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Americans can go back to Vietnam and they don't seem to hold any grudge at all.</v>

80
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.923
<v Speaker 1>Exhibit a</v>

81
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>exhibit a man.</v>

82
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
