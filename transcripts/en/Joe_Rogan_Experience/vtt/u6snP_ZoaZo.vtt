00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.500
Hey everybody,
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience has,

2
00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:08.960
but to fucking set it again,
man said my own name again.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.230
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.

4
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:17.090
Squarespace is an all in one platform that is simple and easy to use and allows

5
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:22.040
you to create an awesome website on your own with no help.
It is that easy.

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.310
It's as simple as attaching a photograph or a video to an email and sending it

7
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:30.050
to someone.
If you can do that,
you can make a website.

8
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:34.670
It's just simple drag and drop interface,
beautiful designs,

9
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.360
24 seven support through live chat and email they have the most.

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.390
It's as easy to make a website that engages all platforms as you could ever

11
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:47.870
possibly imagine.

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.130
So easy that they allow you to make your own website before you even enter in

13
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.370
your credit card information because they know you're going to go,
oh shit,

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.480
this is really good.
Squarespace also has a,

15
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.780
an a logo creator.
We can create a simple,

16
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:05.090
clean logo design for yourself in minutes.

17
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:10.091
You could set up an online store for yourself very easily and very quickly.

18
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.780
You can sell digital downloads like music.
If you're,
if you're a musician,

19
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.010
you could set it up super easy where you can sell music from your website.

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.810
We had a contest,
um,
this past year where we,
uh,

21
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.010
we picked four winners for Squarespace for the,
the best websites of the year.

22
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.520
And it was impossible to pick though those four people.

23
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.220
They had awesome websites,
but the people that we didn't pick,

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.810
they had awesome websites too.

25
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.020
It really is that easy to create a fantastic professional looking website.

26
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.010
And it used to be almost impossible to do.
It was just uh,
uh,
you know,
five,

27
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:50.000
six years ago they used to have to learn programs.
It was a huge pain in the ass.

28
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.210
Almost everyone who had a great website hired someone to do it.

29
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.040
It was just too difficult to do it on your own.

30
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.880
But now it's super easy and it is not expensive.

31
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:03.020
Plans start at $8 a month,
which includes a free domain name.

32

41
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.090
And we're also brought to you by audible.com audible.com is the number one

42
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.620
source on the Internet for digital downloads,
for,

43
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.630
for books,
for lectures,
for you can get podcast comedy shows.

44
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.050
It's a fantastic resource if you're stuck.
[inaudible] excuse me.

45
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.290
If you're stuck on a plane,
you know,

46
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
on a regular basis or if you'd commute every day and that,

47
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.320
that time can be very frustrating for people,

48
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.730
but you can get lost in your own world with an excellent audible book.

49
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.470
And the,
the,
the audible resource,
the um,

50
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.820
the database they have is enormous.

51
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.740
Over 150,000 books and I really can't recommend them enough.

52
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.020
I've been using them for years.
In fact,

53
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.070
audible at one point in time was hiring comedians to come up with five new

54
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:24.550
minutes of material every week and they had like this whole download service

55
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.670
they were coming up with.
They stopped doing that because quite honestly,

56
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.160
it's very difficult to come up with five minutes.

57
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.740
It's worth downloading every week.
Um,

58
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.670
but if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe,

59
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.270
you can get a free audio book and a month,

60
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.760
a free month of audible service.
Once you use it,

61
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.750
you will get hooked because it is fantastic.
If I could recommend a book to you,

62
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.920
I would recommend Steven Pressfield's the art,
excuse me,
the war of art.

63
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.640
Not to be confused with the art of war.
Um,

64
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.270
it's a really excellent book for creative types,

65
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:03.100
for anybody who struggles with,
if you're a procrastinator,

66
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.520
if you're one of those people that just for whatever reason you feel like you

67
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.910
can't get shit done,
that you need to get shunned,
shit,
get shit done.

68
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.160
He really details in,

69
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.220
outlines it in a very clear way and he refers to it all as resistance.

70
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.490
It's one of the most powerful books I've ever read.
And it's a book that I,

71
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.840
I keep a stack of them at home and I hand out to friends,
uh,

72
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.680
just in case because a very small book,
it's a very easy read.

73
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.900
And I handed out to friends,
whatever anybody's like,

74
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.530
if anybody even remotely says,
ah,
I gotta do this thing,
I just go,
listen,

75
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.170
just read this book.
It'll help you do that thing,

76
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.330
whatever it is that you haven't been doing that you need to do.

77
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.310
So go to audible.com forward slash Joe and get a free audio book.

78
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:46.750
That is my recommendation.
And you will get one free audio book.
And again,

79
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.660
30 free days of audible service can't,

80
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.240
can't speak highly enough of a,
of audible.
They're fantastic.
We're also,

81
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.850
what's that?

82
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.820
<v 2>Yeah.
I was just going to say,</v>

83
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.670
we might also be soon doing as with audible and Squarespace,
both of those guys.

84
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.260
And,
and if we are,
then I also won't be able to speak highly enough of them.
Yeah,

85
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:09.790
they're great.
So just give me a couple of weeks and then I'll be doing it.
No,

86
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.310
seriously,
we already use Squarespace for one of our websites for it.

87
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.220
<v 1>tyt.com yeah,
I have a bunch of friends he used Squarespace.</v>

88
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.780
My friend Duncan Trussell uses it.
Kara Santa Maria uses it.
It's a,

89
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:21.640
I've never heard a single complaint.
Squarespace really does.

90
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.470
It's just as advertised.
Um,
last sponsor is on at.com.
O n n,

91
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.440
I t,
which is a human optimization website.

92
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:34.441
Basically what we sell is all kinds of shit to improve your physical fitness,

93
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.520
your,
your mind,
your immune system.

94
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:39.940
Anything that we find that is good that works for you,

95
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.060
for your body to help improve your conditioning.

96
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:47.140
We sell kettle bells and battle ropes and steel maces.

97
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.080
They look like weapons.
They're not weapons folks.
These are all um,

98
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.940
what we call functional strength,
uh,
equipment.

99
00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.050
And what functional strength means is that you're using your entire body to,
uh,

100
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.080
to exercise with instead of a individual isolated movements like curls or things

101
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.060
along those lines.
And in doing so,

102
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.770
you actually improve athleticism and you improve the,
the ability to do work.

103
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.460
And you know,
there's,
there's,
it definitely makes your body look better.

104
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.960
But what's really important is if you're into any sort of sport will actually

105
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:24.710
improve your body's ability to do that sport.
Whether it's a,
you know,

106
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.341
you're into you,

107
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.390
you play a game or you're into martial arts for a martial artists,

108
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.621
the kettle bells,

109
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.460
one of the most popular pieces of strength and conditioning equipment,

110
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.000
it was a originally invented in Russia.
And,
uh,
I,

111
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.880
I don't know how they figured it out,
but it's a genius design.

112
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.900
It's essentially a giant cannon ball that's attached to a metal handle and you

113
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.350
swing it around and there's a series of movements that you can do with them and

114
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.750
just fantastic for strength and conditioning and just for blowing out stress.

115
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.310
I really can't recommend them enough.
Also at [inaudible] dot com we have,
uh,

116
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.160
an entire section called the Onnit academy.

117
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.400
And the audit academy is dedicated to instructionals for how to use strength and

118
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:07.790
conditioning equipment,

119
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:12.791
but also motivational videos that were done by guys like Tim Kennedy who's a

120
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.170
fighter in the UFC and uh,
who is a very fancy,

121
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.240
fascinating and interesting guy.

122
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.960
And we had him on the podcast last week and Tim's got a great video at

123
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.060
[inaudible] dot com as well as many,
many,
many others.

124
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.330
Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t used a codeword Rogan and save 10% of any

125
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:33.200
and all supplements.

126
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:38.201
That's o n n I t and use the code word Rogan Jake Ugur.

127
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.800
I said a right Jank Ugur to 100% not going to fuck it up like Larry King did.

128
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.020
Chank Ugur and he's here from the young Turks.
Cue The music,
young Jamie,

I enjoy what you're doing.

134
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.870
And I enjoy that there's this outlet now where you don't have to go through a

135
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.690
million different steps and get approved by producers.

136
00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:17.040
She just create your own show.
It's relevant.
It's interesting.

137
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:21.360
It's engaging.
People tune in and then all of a sudden,
boom,
look at that.

138
00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:25.440
You're the number one news show on the Internet.
I mean,
that's pretty crazy.

139
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.380
<v 2>Yeah,
it's totally crazy.
Thanks for saying all that.
It's uh,
it's,</v>

140
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:32.370
it's been a crazy,
crazy ride,
you know?
Uh,

141
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.240
and I love doing a podcast here because it reminds me of how we started and we

142
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:41.620
literally started my living room and we're about to hit like 2 billion views and

143
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:45.640
it's 2 billion.
Yeah,
it's madness.
What year did you start?
Uh,

144
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.370
2002 we started doing,

145
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.880
sending in taped shows to Sirius satellite radio.
Wow.

146
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.280
We were actually serious his first original talk show.

147
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 1>Well that's incredible.</v>

148
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 2>So what was,
what was the thought process behind it?
Like you just said,</v>

149
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.570
you know what,
I don't,
nothing out there is representing my point of view.

150
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.600
Let me just create something.
Yeah.
Okay.
So first,

151
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.700
let me just quickly say thanks for having me on and thanks.

152
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.670
[inaudible] never gone on anything,
TV,

153
00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:16.270
anything where people were more excited that I was going to come on someplace.

154
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.650
Really.
Wow.

155
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.700
<v 1>Well we've spoken highly of you and your show many times on it,
so thank you man.</v>

156
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:25.650
A lot of people that are connected here.

157
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.990
<v 2>Yeah,
I appreciate that.
So,
um,</v>

158
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.670
I initially for like three and a half minutes,
I was a lawyer and I hated that.

159
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.940
Couldn't stand it.
So,
um,

160
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.410
well a friend of mine suggested I take like a course on how to start your own TV

161
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:44.850
show.
I was like,
that's mental,
that's not,
you can't do that.
Right.

162
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.790
And so I went to a learning annex course in New York,
uh,

163
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.670
and these lady just took our money and said,
hey,
schmucks,

164
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:53.580
go to your local public access.
You could start any show you're like,
right.

165
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.490
That's it.
That was the whole thing.
And so I was like,
okay,

166
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:59.760
I still don't believe it.
I went to first day of the law at the law firm,

167
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.850
I left early to go to orientation at a public access station.
Okay.

168
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.010
And I went there and you know,
you've got to go through this whole process,

169
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:11.520
get trained up,
Yada Yada.
First Time I go on air,
uh,

170
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.050
we did an hour long show with me and my friends,
half of what it was on politics,

171
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:19.230
half was it,
half of it was on philosophy.
Okay.

172
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.150
Like we had to philosophical debates on God and all that stuff and everybody

173
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:28.290
else was bored to tears.
I walked off the stage thinking that's what I'm doing.

174
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.090
God,
I love that.
I love that.
That's what I'm doing the rest of my life.
Wow.

175
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.700
So I got started there.

176
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.770
Then God like barged my way into local radio.
W Rko in Boston,

177
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:44.790
WWE RC in Washington,
just weekends fill in whatever they'd give me.

178
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.420
I drive nine hours to Boston to do weekend show.
Uh,

179
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.150
and then,
and then I went to Miami and got on TV.
Same thing like bars.

180
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:58.650
My weigh in,
started in sales,
worked my way up,
somehow got on air,

181
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.200
somehow became the supervising producer of their flagship show and Onair

182
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.280
commentator.
And then that got sold.

183
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:10.281
I was Barry Diller's group and then I came out to la and I started a writing

184
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:13.560
cause that's what my main job,
I at the TV station,

185
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:15.810
it had become head writer for the show.

186
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.680
And so then I was wrote on three different pilots here in la.

187
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.450
And I remember when I,
the star,

188
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.400
like the straw that broke the camel's back on that was,

189
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:29.040
I was writing for daisy for when tess and they're like okay now you need to use

190
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:32.460
Daisy's voice.
And I was like,

191
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.730
I don't know what daisy is.
Fucking boy.
She's,
I don't know that at all.

192
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.200
I've never met her and I don't want to be Daisy's voice.
I want to be my voice.

193
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:41.850
So I was like,

194
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.450
I got to get back into radio cause that's the only place they let you do a talk

195
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:48.630
show it.
That's back in o two right.
Oh one actually at that time.

196
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.040
And so I called up my old friends one who was a program director,

197
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.040
wr Rko in Boston who den gone to Xm.
He's like Cenk Dude,

198
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:01.090
you got to go to serious right now that they just opened the door,
go,

199
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:02.620
I'll put in a recommendation for you.

200
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.060
And basically like bars my way in there started the young Turks.

201
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.530
What we know now is the young Turks,

202
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:12.520
I started with Ben who was the anchor at the station in Miami that I was working

203
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.360
with and they literally didn't even know we were on the air for the first six

204
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.790
months.
And then when they found out they were like,
Oh shit,

205
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:19.990
now we've got to pay you

206
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.850
it didn't know you were on the air.
Uh,

207
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.080
because some consultant had hired us and then when they eventually hired a

208
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.470
program director for talk,
cause we're the first talk shit.

209
00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:33.100
They didn't even have a program director for that.

210
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.000
And then they hired one and they're like,
oh right,
right.
These guys are on there.

211
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.290
Okay,
what should we do with them?

212
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.800
And he had me go into New York and he sat me down and listen to some tapes.

213
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.340
He's like,
you guys are surprisingly decent.
All right,
fuck it.
We'll pay.

214
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.220
And that's how we got started.

215
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.280
<v 1>Are you guys still on exit and well now it's serious NSM,
right?
Right.
Combined.</v>

216
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.240
<v 2>No,
we were on there for a million years,</v>

217
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:59.241
but honestly the video online video got so much bigger than radio.

218
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.130
Then it became not worth it.

219
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.540
Like even for the minor hassle of like doing formatting,

220
00:13:06.541 --> 00:13:10.680
doing three hours,
we're like it's not worth it.
So we just let it go.

221
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.140
<v 1>Do you guys have a a podcast version of it or an audible download version of it?</v>

222
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:15.901
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

223
00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:20.250
so on Itunes we got a free audio podcasts and a free video podcast that's like

224
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.640
two out of the six segments we do every day.
So people can sample it.

225
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.680
It's not bad actually.
That's already like,

226
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.190
well probably more than half an hour of content for free.

227
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.130
And then if you're a hardcore and you liked the show,

228
00:13:32.131 --> 00:13:37.131
then you just go to our website TYT network.com and it's a $10 membership.

229
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.050
And so then you get all of it,
you get the main show,

230
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.120
you get all the network shows,
you get everything.

231
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.550
<v 1>So if anybody wanted to,
they can get plenty of free content,</v>

232
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.910
but you do so much stuff that if you want to be,

233
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.730
so what percentage of the people that like,

234
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.270
like get to it and start downloading it.

235
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.370
Do you know like what percentage actually sign up?

236
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.920
You have a huge amount of subscribers,
right?

237
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.810
<v 2>So on Youtube,
uh,
we,</v>

238
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.500
we have a little over one and a half million subscribers for the young Turks to

239
00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:09.170
flagship show for the whole network we have,

240
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.720
but I think about 3 million subscribers.
You know,

241
00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:14.600
when you have all of our shows like pop trigger or what the flick,

242
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:18.890
which is movie reviews,
TYT sports,
stuff like that.
But,
um,

243
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.370
and we have 64 million views a month on the network,

244
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.430
24 million uniques every month.

245
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.300
But when you talking about people paying 10 bucks a month,

246
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:32.390
we almost never advertise it,
which is so stupid of us,

247
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.630
partly because we had troubles with the website and stuff.
Uh,

248
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.050
the people who pay the 10 bucks,
that's around four to 5,000

249
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.310
<v 1>still though.
Wow.
It's amazing.
So you've,</v>

250
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:47.310
you've essentially set up your own studio.
You have your own network.
I mean it's,

251
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.980
it's not just a show now you have like this entire thing you've developed.

252
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.400
Are you,
you're only on some of those shows too,
right?

253
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.980
There's gang of other people working for you.

254
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.420
<v 2>Yeah.
So there's 29 channels.
So if I was on all those shows,</v>

255
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.530
my head would explode.

256
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:07.520
My head's about to explode as it is to run on the network and being on the show.

257
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:12.470
And then I,
for three years,
I did TV at the same time,
which was just so crazy.

258
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.670
It was just,
I was going to melt down.
My body was breaking down.
Um,

259
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.930
but yeah,
all those channels,

260
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.350
a great host.
We got 30 people that are full time.

261
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:27.470
But then if you add all the hosts that are not full time to it,

262
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:31.910
then you're talking probably 50,
60 people.
That's insane.
Yeah.
And we all,

263
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:35.990
we literally started in our living room,
like when,
hey Susie,
who's still with us,

264
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:39.560
12 years later,
walked in as an intern.
He was like,
okay,

265
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:41.720
there's like a 12% chance I'm getting murdered today.

266
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.690
This is this guy's living room.
And it's kind of scary looking

267
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.500
and I can't believe he stuck with us,
but he did.

268
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.520
Now we've got this big studio space in Culver City and we're producing shows

269
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:53.354
like there's no tomorrow.

270
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.900
<v 1>Wow.
And you guys recently,
did you use Kickstarter or something to fund your,</v>

271
00:15:57.901 --> 00:16:00.810
your studio?
What did,
how did you set that up?
What'd you do?

272
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.750
<v 2>We did Indeigogo um,
so it's basically the same thing as Kickstarter.
And um,</v>

273
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:10.220
we like it a little better.
And we thought,
all right,
uh,

274
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.990
we need money to build the new studio because we had been with current

275
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:19.220
television and they had paid our rent.
Why this great deal with them where I,

276
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:20.480
they paid me to be a host.

277
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:24.130
They paid some of our producers and they paid for the rent.
Great deal.
Uh,

278
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.400
so when we left,

279
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.040
when they got bought by Al Jazeera and we didn't want to be without just
Jazeera.

280
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.090
So then we got to go build our own studio,
which is incredibly expensive.

281
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.300
So we were like,
okay,
let's try this because you know,

282
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:38.030
we built everything with our audience.
Let's try to build this with them.

283
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.450
And I remember we sat around in a room and there was like six,

284
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.230
seven of us were like,
what?
What should we go for?

285
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.640
And every single person agreed 150,000 like,
let's go for it.
Let's go nuts.

286
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:53.300
Let's try to get 150,000.
So then it came back around to me and I was like,
okay,

287
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:57.190
that sounds good.
Uh,
we're going to go for two 50.
Okay.

288
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.760
Because I'd rather get to try for two 15 and get to one 75 and then people are

289
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:03.410
like,
oh,
you didn't make it.
I'm like,
yeah,

290
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.420
but I've got an extra 25,000 I didn't expect.
So that's awesome.
You know,

291
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.950
I don't give a care what people say as long as we can actually use the money to

292
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:14.690
build a studio.
Anyway.
It turns out we got basically a little over

293
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.900
<v 1>$400,000.
Whoa.
That's incredible.</v>

294
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.740
But that's just a sign that what you're doing resonates.
So that's gotta be,

295
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.870
that's gotta be very fulfilling.
That's got to feel nice.

296
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.380
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
so my dad,
uh,</v>

297
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.140
is a guy who like,

298
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:34.190
we'll focus on the positive for about a second and a half and then he'll be
like,

299
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.670
okay,
yeah,
but let me tell you all the things that are going wrong and Yada Yada.

300
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.460
So I've unfortunately internalize that.
I mean,

301
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:42.500
it's got a good aspect to it in a bad aspect,

302
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.910
but so like I never take a moment to be like,
yes,
right.

303
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.340
I a little bit,
when we did the billion views party,

304
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.390
we did that a youtube space and I was like,
dude,
billions.

305
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:58.410
Kind of a hard number to deny,
right?
Like if you talk,
I'm like soup.

306
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.760
Like in some ways I'm humble because I think I failed so much in my life that

307
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:05.850
it's impossible not to be humble.
Right.
But in other ways,

308
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:10.560
I'm a massive ego maniac.
But even when we started,
if you told this EGOMANIAC,

309
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:13.530
we're going a billion views,
I'd be like,
dude,
come on,
bounce a recent.
Right.

310
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.600
That's not going to happen.
That's crazy talk.

311
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.120
So then I soaked it in a little bit.
Yeah.

312
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:22.080
And when the audience delivered and it was over 400,000,
that was another moment.

313
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:25.620
Like,
just like you said,
it wasn't the money as much and the money was great,

314
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.690
but it w it was more like,
man,
they really,
they believe in us,
man.

315
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.330
And it,
and that comes with a responsibility is,
you know,
Spiderman,

316
00:18:34.331 --> 00:18:35.990
his uncle told him with great power,

317
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.070
<v 1>great responsibility.
That was before he left the crook.
Killed By.
Yeah.
Uncle.</v>

318
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.810
Well,
what you're doing is what people have wanted to see for a while.

319
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:50.580
Someone who has,
uh,
it's,
it's,
uh,
it's an opinion straight from the source.

320
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.550
It's not filtered by the networks,
by the executives,

321
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:58.551
by all these people that have measured statistics and looked at numbers and

322
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:02.040
decided this is the approach that would best suit them.
And you know,

323
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:05.610
we take need to take the fox girls and their skirts should be one inch shorter

324
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:06.331
than it is right now.

325
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:10.170
We've shown that we can get an extra 1 million views a month if we have more
leg.

326
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.580
You know what you're doing is,
this is my name is Janke [inaudible].

327
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.680
This is my opinion.
Boom.

328
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:18.900
I'm going to put it out there and I don't give a fuck what you think.

329
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.700
And that is what everybody is always wanted because what you're getting when you

330
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:26.520
listen to the nightly news today on Wall Street,

331
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.090
we learned you're getting a fake voice with a guy who is reading off a

332
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:31.580
teleprompter with a,

333
00:19:31.581 --> 00:19:36.581
a gang of people that their objective is just about making money and about

334
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:40.920
producing this program,
this business that's called the news.

335
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.320
And so what their,
their objective is not getting information out to people.

336
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:50.700
Their objective is not debating the hard facts.
It's not rabble rousing.

337
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:51.900
It's not telling people like,

338
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:54.750
we better wake up and fucking realize what's going on here.
It's none of that.

339
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:58.740
There's none of that.
But you come along and that is exactly what you're doing.

340
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.040
And then,
and then people start going,
hey,
look at this,
look at this.

341
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:03.390
There's another thing going on over here.

342
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.440
This guy's got this thing and he's using the Internet and woo the Internet.

343
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.170
Oh my God,
nobody could tell him what to do.
No,
nobody's telling you what to do.

344
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.280
This is his opinion.
And then it takes off.
And that's,

345
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.910
that's a very important thing that in my opinion,

346
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.870
sort of embodies or personifies this time in our culture.

347
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.290
It's a very unique time.
And that,

348
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.040
that ability that we have now to just freely express ourselves.
And you know,

349
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:31.730
you could become one of those people.
Like there's,
I,

350
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.720
I found out this guy the other day online,

351
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:38.160
some science podcast and he has on youtube or some science show on Youtube.

352
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.620
Somebody told me,
hey,
you should check this out.
I looked at it.

353
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.480
Each video is like 17 million views,
6 million views.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

354
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.980
How many of those fucking guys are there now?

355
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.360
You've just find out about them and already they have millions and millions and

356
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.290
millions of subscribers.
This is,
there's never been a time like that.

357
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.330
There's never been a time like we're experiencing today.

358
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.990
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
I think our successes is bigger than us.</v>

359
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.180
It's not about us.
Right.
Just like you said,

360
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:09.950
it's about a certain period of time in,
in the history of media that uh,

361
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.221
in,

362
00:21:10.221 --> 00:21:15.221
in essence what they've done is the mainstream media has handed us like 80% of

363
00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.500
the market just by their abject failure.
You know,

364
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:23.060
so you turn on TV and it's wall to wall fakeness and it's guys reading from a

365
00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:23.690
prompter.

366
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.290
It's guys who are supposed to be reporters that never asked followup questions

367
00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:30.740
cause they don't actually know the material that they're producers write out the

368
00:21:30.741 --> 00:21:32.750
questions ahead of time.
I've been there.
Right.

369
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.710
They did write out the questions ahead of time.
They read it.
They're,

370
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.070
they're not news anchors.
Their news actors.
That's great.
Wait describing them.

371
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.830
And so,
and then they got that fake voice that you're talking about.

372
00:21:42.831 --> 00:21:47.300
I mean like what is that?
Why,
why do they talk like that?
Like I remember,

373
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.410
this is a story I told him on the show once and I'm in New Orleans for Mardi

374
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.670
Gras,
were,
were pretty fucked up.

375
00:21:52.671 --> 00:21:56.660
And then we turned on the TV and it's a normal local news lady and she's like,

376
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.480
and a number of ambulance has doubled,

377
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.510
but so has the number of injuries.

378
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.210
<v 1>Why,</v>

379
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.700
<v 2>why are you seeing it like that?
It's really weird.</v>

380
00:22:08.701 --> 00:22:11.250
Like if anybody in real life talk like that,
you'd be like that.

381
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.470
That's they're tripping.
There's something wrong with them.

382
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:18.310
<v 1>This two parallels.
There's a top 40 Dj and the Strip club Dj,
those,</v>

383
00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:22.990
those are also fake voices that they adopt that are uniquely,

384
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.240
uh,
like attached to that job.

385
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.150
<v 2>Yeah.
And so when I was in radio,
people were like,
dude,
you're mental.</v>

386
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.850
You're going to keep the name Jank.
Ugur and,

387
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.880
and the chank is spelled with a c in the beginning.
They're like,
you're nuts,

388
00:22:35.881 --> 00:22:40.730
dude.
Jack Unger,
Jake Underwood,
who cares?
Who Cares?

389
00:22:40.731 --> 00:22:41.564
Right.

390
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.690
And I even once ran into gene Simmons at some local La and new station here.

391
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:50.030
And we were both in the green room and he's like,
oh,

392
00:22:50.031 --> 00:22:53.660
you're the dumbest guy I've ever met who keeps a name like Janky rigor.
Okay.

393
00:22:53.661 --> 00:22:57.110
He's like,
yeah,
you just make up a name.
Gene Simmons made up,
kisses made up,

394
00:22:57.111 --> 00:23:00.530
keep it simple stupid.
Okay.
And so he yelled at me.

395
00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:04.790
But what it turned out to be is kind of an ironic advantage because there's no

396
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:08.840
way Janky yogurt isn't real.
Right?
Right.
That's,
that's my real name.

397
00:23:08.841 --> 00:23:13.250
It's a pain in the ass,
but I'm not fake like everybody else on TV and radio.

398
00:23:13.251 --> 00:23:14.084
And I'm not going to

399
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.430
<v 1>like every,
doesn't everybody want to say fuck you to that guy?
Yeah,</v>

400
00:23:20.431 --> 00:23:21.031
I think we do.

401
00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:24.990
Now we also want to say fuck you to politicians that talk like that too.

402
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.800
When do you think there's going to be a time where we get a guy who talks in a

403
00:23:28.801 --> 00:23:31.950
political speech like that?
Like you like a guy who just,

404
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.340
who comes along and says,
you know what,
Ladies and gentlemen,

405
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.140
the United States that we know today,
this great nation,

406
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.400
that we're tired of,
that we're tired of these weird pauses.

407
00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:47.990
We're tired of weird theatrical presentation,
you know,
we,

408
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.740
we would like someone who's running for president,
who's running for any office,

409
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:56.030
Congress,
whatever,
just talk,
talk,
wearing a fucking normal human being.

410
00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.350
You could talk with passion,
you could talk with energy,
you could talk with,
with,

411
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.010
with,

412
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:06.010
with a real engaging sense of the present and still be you.

413
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.680
You don't have to be this fucking strip club Dj.

414
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.200
Oh ride on the main stage.

415
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.310
That same voice is repeated throughout the trip clubs all across America.

416
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.140
I did this recent thing where I was calling in,
um,
uh,

417
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:24.320
a bunch of radio stations because of a comedy central special that I had,

418
00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:27.230
that it was coming out.
And when I'm calling in to talk to them,

419
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.610
there was three or four stations where I'm like,
okay,
this fucking guy,

420
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:32.900
I'm talking to the exact guy,

421
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.290
he's just using a different voice and now he's in Memphis,
you know,

422
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:39.950
and now he's in Dallas and now he's in Ohio.
It's fucking crazy.

423
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:43.790
Like they adopt that same fake voice.
We,
you know,

424
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.250
I think we need,
we need to change.
We certainly need a change in,

425
00:24:48.251 --> 00:24:53.150
in the way information is being broadcasted to people.
And that's a start.

426
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.720
<v 2>So this Saturday we held a debate for the 33rd congressional district.</v>

427
00:24:57.721 --> 00:25:02.140
Henry Waxman is retiring.
And so there's like 15 people running in,

428
00:25:02.141 --> 00:25:06.090
12 of them showed up at the [inaudible] studios.
It's a US congressional seat.

429
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.010
And it's funny,
the guys who had the,

430
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.940
like we're higher up in the polls were the guys who unfortunately like more

431
00:25:14.731 --> 00:25:18.900
polished but polished meant like they like point to you like this,

432
00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:20.340
they don't want to use a single finger,

433
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.850
they do the Bill Clinton point or they do this and then they talk and talking

434
00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:28.410
points.
But what was cool is that like nine out of 12 guys weren't like that.

435
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.000
And then you're like,
oh wow.

436
00:25:30.001 --> 00:25:32.970
A political debate where that guy's an actual human being.

437
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.130
And so when the guy with the talking point talked,
it sounded weird,
right?
Like,

438
00:25:38.131 --> 00:25:42.450
hey,
why are you using that voice?
That's weird.
So it was an interesting contrast.

439
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.920
Yeah.
And,
and I think people got to find,
and I did follow up questions,

440
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.370
so they'd do their talk like you,

441
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:50.790
you know how in a debate you ask a question and then they'll just answer it any

442
00:25:50.791 --> 00:25:53.280
way they like,
right.
That's what Sarah Pailin realized.

443
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.270
She was super nervous about debating Biden and then realized,
oh right,

444
00:25:57.271 --> 00:25:58.800
I don't have to actually answer any of the questions.

445
00:25:58.801 --> 00:26:03.801
So she memorized what she was going to say about x number of topics and that's

446
00:26:03.871 --> 00:26:06.570
how she got through the debate.
So that's what they were doing.

447
00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:08.190
And then I was like,
oh,
that's interesting.
Okay.

448
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.480
Now the question I asked was actually this.
Okay,
so what's your release?

449
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.900
And so that was,
I dunno,
maybe we can change that too.

450
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:16.481
<v 1>Well,</v>

451
00:26:16.481 --> 00:26:21.481
I think that that you saw that a lot in the early days of standup comedy,

452
00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:24.490
there was a lot of guys who had like the standup comedy,

453
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.770
like a way of talking.
It was almost like a,

454
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.740
an effected thing that everybody borrowed when they went to do standup comedy.

455
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.460
And then as people started getting better,

456
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.880
you sort of dropped that and became more of yourself.
But I think in a,

457
00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:44.430
in a great sense,
politicians don't have that luxury of,
you know,

458
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:45.240
so they,

459
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.890
they try to sort of connect with what they think is the most effective voice

460
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:50.724
possible.

461
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:55.500
And that voice is the voice that sort of in their head represents

462
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:59.190
professionalism.
Yup.
That's it.
It's so weird term.
Right?

463
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:02.970
Professionalism's a weird term because you want someone to be dedicated.

464
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.720
He wants someone to be focused and disciplined,

465
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.270
but you don't want to fucking professional and the last place you want to

466
00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:11.580
professional as a politician.

467
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.250
<v 2>Exactly.
Yeah.
So two things about that.</v>

468
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:18.900
I talked to a consultant was a political consultant and he said,
look,

469
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.990
Jank part of the reason we give them the talking points and try to keep them on

470
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:25.920
message and make them sound robotic is because you'd be surprised how stupid

471
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.730
there.
And he's like,
and if we just let them talk,

472
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.550
they will make terrible mistakes and they will lose.

473
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.020
One of my favorite moments at all

474
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.860
<v 1>politics is the Rick Perry moment.
We forgot what he was talking about.</v>

475
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.450
I forgot some points.
Yeah.
And then he goes to kills.

476
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:43.680
I don't remember the other ones.
That's a dude.
You're done.
He just tapped out.

477
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.360
I mean,
he really did just tap out.

478
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.860
<v 2>Yeah.
He literally said in that debate,
like he forgot pause,
pause,</v>

479
00:27:48.861 --> 00:27:51.950
like the most wonderful,
awkward five seconds in any debate.

480
00:27:51.951 --> 00:27:54.200
And then like he said,
oops.

481
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.610
<v 1>That.
And then there's a homeboy from Vermont,
uh,
what's his name?</v>

482
00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:04.220
Who was screaming and that and that Howard Dean,

483
00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:06.680
Howard Dean where it crushed him.
One,
one,

484
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:13.250
one yell,
one yell,
and it tanked the whole thing.
Well,
he see

485
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.810
<v 2>point.
He'd already lost Iowa.</v>

486
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:18.500
I actually really liked Howard Dean or I used to do as well.
Right.
Um,

487
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.180
so he,
that was after he'd lost the big race,

488
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.520
so he probably would have lost anyway.

489
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:30.170
And I think what really put a hatchet in him was,
was the media.
Like they didn't,

490
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.390
they didn't want a guy who was an actual,

491
00:28:32.391 --> 00:28:35.810
like independent and rebellious,
et cetera.

492
00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:40.100
They wanted someone super boring and dull who was totally pro Salish shrink,

493
00:28:40.101 --> 00:28:41.180
just like John Kerry.

494
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.500
So they lean heavily and Kerry's direction and look at,

495
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.190
some people will go further and say,
oh,
they immediate manufacturer does scream.

496
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.030
No they didn't.
I remember,
and we covered it on the young Turks were like,

497
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.510
Oh shit,
we lit.
We really liked the guy,
but he sounded like a maniac,

498
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.120
<v 1>right?
Well folks who don't know,</v>

499
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.000
and when you're in a large audience like that and you're,

500
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.970
you're yelling into a microphone,

501
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.540
you don't usually have a monitor or anything in your ear.

502
00:29:08.541 --> 00:29:11.420
So you don't know how you sound too.
When someone's,

503
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.030
something's broadcast directly into a microphone.

504
00:29:14.031 --> 00:29:16.580
That microphone is going directly into the recording device.

505
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.610
And it's very different than what you're hearing when you're yelling.

506
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.740
So if a bunch of people are screaming like,

507
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.610
and we're going to go straight to the White House,
you're,
you're,

508
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.510
you're yelling this where there's thousands of people also yelling.

509
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.250
There's an overwhelming amount of sound.

510
00:29:31.251 --> 00:29:35.810
But what goes into that microphone is connected to your face,
stupid.
And it's,

511
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.100
it's loud as fuck.

512
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.560
And people are gonna hear this maniacal screech that comes of you,

513
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.630
and it's not going to be in perspective.

514
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.570
It's not going to be in the perspective of the actual rally itself.

515
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.590
<v 2>Yeah.
And look,
whether it's media or politics,</v>

516
00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.160
oftentimes people make the mistake of playing to the room instead of people

517
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.420
watching.
Right.

518
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.450
And there's so many more people watching at home than there are people in that

519
00:29:57.451 --> 00:29:58.230
room.

520
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.920
So that's why politicians keep getting caught on tape because they're not used

521
00:30:01.921 --> 00:30:03.630
to the youtube generation.

522
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.690
So like they'll go into a room full of funders and they'll be like,
oh,

523
00:30:06.691 --> 00:30:09.960
it doesn't the 47% suck.
Haha,
screw the poor.

524
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:14.070
Then they'll go to another room with other people and say the exact opposite and

525
00:30:14.071 --> 00:30:17.700
they'll just keep going room to room saying things that don't make that don't

526
00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:20.670
match up.
But dude,
like hello,

527
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.180
catch up to 2014 everything's on tape.

528
00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:26.820
And then you'll play the two tapes next to each other and it,

529
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.380
and they look like assholes.

530
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.350
And that's because they're used to playing to just whoever's in the room.

531
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.670
<v 1>Yeah.
They're used to playing to just whoever's in the room.</v>

532
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:37.180
And they're not used to the repercussions of the truth getting out there because

533
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.520
the slide,
it's an escapable.
And I,

534
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.600
I personally think there's this lack of privacy comes with a lot of concerns.

535
00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:46.060
A lot of people worried,
a lot of people,
they,
they,

536
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.740
they look at the future and they say,
well,

537
00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:50.440
we're not going to have any privacy anymore.
Yeah.

538
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.840
But ultimately I think that the truth,
it's,
it's,

539
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.350
it's more beneficial that people have complete total transparency across the

540
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:03.610
board than it is for people to engage in the same sort of corrupt activities

541
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:05.860
that have turned this nation into this.
It's,

542
00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.480
it's basically a bought and sold system and there's no other way to get past

543
00:31:10.481 --> 00:31:14.440
that bought and sold system.
Then ultimate complete,
total transparency.

544
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.050
And when you have that ultimate complete total transparency,

545
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:21.580
which we're starting to see manifest itself in politics and in social media.

546
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.160
And no,
this is a kind of across the board.
It's a slow,

547
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:28.360
steady progression to no secrets and sorry,

548
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:31.180
but that's just the way of the world.
That's,
it's going that way.

549
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.300
You could be moaning,
you could scream at the top of your lungs.

550
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.560
I'm moving to the woods,

551
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:38.980
I'm going to live off of fucking logs and I'm gonna have my own well water,

552
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.590
you can do that.
But everybody in the cities,

553
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.310
everybody in the congested centers of population centers there,

554
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.900
they're not going to have secrets anymore.

555
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.990
It's just gonna be just like if someone was in China,

556
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:51.910
you used to not be able to call them on the phone.

557
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:54.160
Well you can now cause that's what happened.

558
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.490
And in the future there's not going to be any secrets man.

559
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.240
And so if you're running for politics or if you're running for a political

560
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:05.100
office and you want to say shit like 47% of people aren't going to vote for him

561
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:08.860
anyway,
so fuck them.
People got to know that.
That's your real attitude.

562
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.390
You're not going to be able to hide your attitude.

563
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:14.380
I think that's great because I don't believe that there's bad people out there

564
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.480
that it's only bad people that run for office.

565
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:18.340
It's only bad people that can get into office.

566
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.350
It's only bad people that run companies.

567
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.140
I think you allow bad people to run companies,

568
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.500
bad people that run corporations because of the fact there's no transparency

569
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.300
because they don't face repercussions for environmental damage for,
you know,

570
00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:35.140
employing Third World Country People in Third World countries for a fucking

571
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:36.340
dollar a month.
We,

572
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.790
all those repercussions are going to be all on the table now and it's not going

573
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:41.624
to be a simple,

574
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.230
<v 2>so two things about that.
One great example of it is,
uh,</v>

575
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.310
today with Donald Sterling,
like,

576
00:32:47.311 --> 00:32:50.850
so he does his apology that they're going to broadcast on CNN tonight.

577
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.500
And if you,
for the transcript that they released the parts that,

578
00:32:55.501 --> 00:32:59.310
the excerpts that I saw,
he never apologized to black people.

579
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:04.110
He apologizes to the other NBA owners and he says,
you know,

580
00:33:04.111 --> 00:33:08.370
once in 35 years,
uh,
I did a slip up and it's just one mistake.

581
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.110
Can they find a way to forgive that?

582
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:15.650
What he's saying is I slipped up in letting you know how I actually think like,

583
00:33:17.101 --> 00:33:21.960
so he hates transparency and he's like,
God dammit.
Like they caught me once,

584
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:26.550
but like he doesn't get that.
No,
no,
no.
It's your mentality.
That's the problem.

585
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.450
Like,
and because they're so used to being like,
I own the clippers,
I'm uh,

586
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.550
you know,
multimillionaire,
you,

587
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.540
you don't get to know anything about me and I could be in his racist as I,
like,

588
00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:37.980
I could cover it up,
et cetera.

589
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.510
So that this new world is shaking them up and they can't get used to,

590
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.330
they can't wrap their mind around it.
And he keeps thinking like,

591
00:33:45.331 --> 00:33:46.860
why can't I just take that back?

592
00:33:46.861 --> 00:33:51.230
And then everybody goes back to not realizing I'm a racist.
So,

593
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.320
so that's part of it.

594
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:57.650
The other part is that we've got this split right where you have television and

595
00:33:57.871 --> 00:34:01.440
radio and all that,
that's super fake.
And then you have the new media,

596
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.910
like your podcast,

597
00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:07.911
like what we do online with video that's super real and it's a fascinating

598
00:34:08.431 --> 00:34:12.300
clash.
And old media hates us.
Like they don't,

599
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.030
they don't want to acknowledge for real,

600
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.810
like w even like people that work in media,

601
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.320
they're,
when they're covering it,
like when we say,
okay,
we got this many views,

602
00:34:22.321 --> 00:34:26.530
et cetera,
they're Google verified.
Go check with Google.
They're like,
ah,
I can,

603
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.650
I don't know.
I can't understand Internet numbers.

604
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.750
Well then maybe you shouldn't do that

605
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.730
<v 1>again.
There's then the Internet numbers,
the Internet numbers,</v>

606
00:34:33.731 --> 00:34:36.340
the only numbers that are real when you look at us,
right?

607
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.510
If you look at numbers like the ratings for a television show,

608
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:45.310
if anybody who knows how television shows a ratings,
it's Voodoo.

609
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.050
It's crazy.
There's like,

610
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.740
I don't know how many thousand boxes that are supposed to represent 300 plus

611
00:34:50.741 --> 00:34:53.320
million people,
but it's nonsense.

612
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.340
Those Nielsen ratings are fucking crazy.
Like they really don't know.

613
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.420
Not only that,

614
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.650
the reality of the difference between the Nielsen ratings and the ratings that

615
00:35:02.651 --> 00:35:06.660
they've pulled from digital boxes from dvrs from Saturday,

616
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.900
it's a very different number.

617
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.070
It's a very different number and there's a lot of shows that would benefit from

618
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:17.071
them releasing the numbers that are on a Dvr is the numbers are on a satellite

619
00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:19.030
boxes and cable boxes,

620
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.400
but they can't really do that because they can't acknowledge,

621
00:35:21.401 --> 00:35:24.610
first of all the fact that they keep track of what everybody's watching it all

622
00:35:24.611 --> 00:35:29.050
the time.
And then also like the digital,
the Nielsen system,

623
00:35:29.051 --> 00:35:33.340
it's like a established system that people in benefiting from from a long time

624
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:38.130
until like throw that out and shake it up with millions dollars would change

625
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:38.840
hands.

626
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.790
<v 2>See that's a huge advantage for us though because we can tell them exactly what</v>

627
00:35:43.791 --> 00:35:46.880
they're doing wrong and they can say,
Hey Joe Jank you're right.
That's,

628
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.110
but they can't turn the ship around because they were,

629
00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.820
they already make too much money doing what they do and yes,

630
00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:54.440
they're killing off their audience.
Yes.

631
00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:57.830
Eventually they'll hit that iceberg and sink so quick.
Right.

632
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.940
But they can't stop doing what they're doing cause their ship is too damn big

633
00:36:01.941 --> 00:36:04.970
and they can't turn it around.
So Hey,
Saturday for them.

634
00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.460
<v 1>Isn't that sort of the same thing with politics as well and with corporations as</v>

635
00:36:09.461 --> 00:36:09.821
well.

636
00:36:09.821 --> 00:36:14.500
It's like what they've done for the longest time is just that's how they extract

637
00:36:14.501 --> 00:36:17.500
money.
That's how they get money out of the system.
That's what they do.

638
00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.740
And for the longest time they've done it this way and just to put a pause on it

639
00:36:22.901 --> 00:36:27.820
and sort of reshuffle and redistribute where the money's going,
it's like,
fuck,

640
00:36:27.821 --> 00:36:29.860
that's too hard.
We're just going to crash into the rocks.

641
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.040
Let's just ride this bitch right into the beach,
hit the rocks,

642
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.070
the boat will shatter,
we'll get off.
Whoever survives survives,

643
00:36:36.071 --> 00:36:39.390
we'll make a new boat.
Yeah,
it seems like that's what they're doing.

644
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.060
<v 2>So two things about that now.
First on the radio end,</v>

645
00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.910
do you know how they do radio ratings?
Because it'll blow your mind,
but Tron,

646
00:36:45.911 --> 00:36:49.840
yeah,
those books to send out to people and they were,
what were you listening to?

647
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.970
Oh,
this,
yeah.
I mean,
of course,

648
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.570
99% of the population doesn't know how they get the radio ratings and they send

649
00:36:55.571 --> 00:36:58.060
out these books and you have to fill it out for three months.

650
00:36:58.061 --> 00:37:01.120
What were you listening in 15 minute increments.
So,

651
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.360
and everybody fills it out at the very end when they have to turn it in.

652
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.520
So they're like,
okay.
Um,

653
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.590
month and a half ago at 2:15 PM I dunno,

654
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.010
I think I was listening to rush.
I Dunno.

655
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.720
Did they pay them to fill those books out?
I think like five bucks.

656
00:37:16.721 --> 00:37:19.240
So there's like,
so they're just like,
give me the five bucks.
I don't care.

657
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:23.440
Like it was a comical comical,
right?
How low that they pay.
So,

658
00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:28.750
so everybody makes it up.
So like th the radio numbers are pure fiction,

659
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.920
pure fiction.
So then that was the old days.
Now they're going to people meters,

660
00:37:32.921 --> 00:37:35.780
which is a little bit more accurate.
And then when they went to people meet her,

661
00:37:35.781 --> 00:37:40.120
they're like,
oh my God,
nobody listens to rush Limbaugh.
Nobody.

662
00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.090
Sean Hannity,
Glenn Beck,
nobody listens to them.

663
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.470
And are the numbers like what's the difference?
What they thought was so,
yeah.

664
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.340
So first of all,

665
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:52.410
the number that rush Limbaugh used to go with was he threw out a number of the

666
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.470
fake number.
It just broadcasting,
right?
His fake number was 20 million.

667
00:37:56.471 --> 00:37:58.690
Nobody ever questioned where he got that number.

668
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.100
Nobody even knows if it's per week or per month.
Right?
It's not funny.

669
00:38:03.101 --> 00:38:06.640
Like what do you mean?
That's,
that's a big difference.
He's like 20 million.

670
00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:11.470
That's it.
Okay.
And then talkers magazine did a bullshit guests and they're like,

671
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.660
hmm,
14 million.
Okay.
First of all,

672
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.960
difference between 14 and 20 is pretty substantial,
but it doesn't really matter.

673
00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:20.290
So reporter asked the Michael Harrison Photography magazine,
he's like,

674
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:22.120
where'd you get the 14 million?
He's like,
I guess

675
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.330
they don't know it all.
So I,
you know,

676
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.830
the difference per market between what rush claim to be getting and then what he

677
00:38:32.831 --> 00:38:35.680
got in the people meters.
That level of,
I don't know.

678
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:39.880
I do know the w ABC in New York,
which is the main conservative talk station,

679
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:43.540
is thinking of changing the format because that's how disastrous it was.

680
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:48.370
Glenn Beck loss to like San Francisco or Philly and Philly,
I think immediately,

681
00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.090
um,
soon as they found out the real number,
right?
Uh,

682
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.530
and Sean Hannity is in a tailspin,

683
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.010
so they still got money to milk from that system.
You know,

684
00:38:57.011 --> 00:39:00.070
they still have their contracts that lasts for x number of years,
right?

685
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.380
But they're on their way out.
So those numbers are super fake.

686
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.020
That compared to that.
Now when you go tell a old media writer,

687
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.410
whatever name it,
you know,
New York Times,
whatever,
CNN,

688
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.590
and you say young Turks is bigger than rush Limbaugh,

689
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.850
they'll laugh you out of the room.
No Way.
They believe that.
No Way.
Right?

690
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.530
But the reality is he's nowhere near 14 million listeners a month.

691
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:28.540
Nowhere near it.
And we're Google verified 24 million uniques,

692
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.090
let alone 64 million views,
right?

693
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.640
We're at least twice as large as rush limbo.
But nobody like,

694
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.230
but no,
let it go.

695
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:42.540
<v 1>There's no media hype behind you.
There's no promotion that you will,
you got to,</v>

696
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.920
I got to you from my internet message board.
Just complete word of mouth.

697
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.740
Somebody threw up a video,
check this out.
You know,
I don't,

698
00:39:49.741 --> 00:39:52.260
I don't even remember what was the original thing,
but I remember,
oh,

699
00:39:52.261 --> 00:39:54.510
this is a cool show.
Oh,
I get it.
Boom.

700
00:39:54.511 --> 00:39:58.410
And then I started listening and paying attention and that's how you spread.

701
00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.900
Whereas you know,
if you,
if it's rushed,
limbo,

702
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.890
excellence in broadcasting or Sean Hannity mean there's a whole fucking machine

703
00:40:04.891 --> 00:40:08.340
behind these things and there's a whole,
I mean it's a part of the thing.

704
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.920
The Sean Hannity thing is particularly disturbing to me because what he

705
00:40:10.921 --> 00:40:14.790
represents to me is like this sort of consolidated ignorance,

706
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.350
like this decision to be ignorant about things.
Like we're,
we're,
we're,

707
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.830
we're on the right,
we're in,

708
00:40:19.831 --> 00:40:23.370
we're right wing and we're going to stick with what is American flag behind me

709
00:40:23.371 --> 00:40:26.790
and God bless our troops and cut to commercial and this,
this,

710
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.940
this sort of agreement to not delve into the nuances of very difficult topics

711
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.960
and to,
you know,
to take a hard stance towards the right.

712
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.530
I think that's like one of the most damaging things about the whole paradigm of

713
00:40:40.531 --> 00:40:43.350
the right.
And the left is this hard line,
you know,

714
00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:47.490
almost a religious acceptance of one side or the other.

715
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.490
And it was really personified with Hannity.
Well,
a bunch of things.

716
00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:52.740
But recently by this Bundy ranch incident,

717
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.480
this fucking crazy ass hole in Nevada that these shitheads got behind.

718
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.170
This guy is fucking crazy.
He's crazy.

719
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.660
And he says a bunch of Nutty,
racist shit.

720
00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:07.170
Like black people were better off when they were slaves on the plantation

721
00:41:07.171 --> 00:41:11.310
because now I go to Vegas and I see them running around and they know they're

722
00:41:11.311 --> 00:41:13.630
not going to school and they're getting each other pregnant.
Like,
what?

723
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.620
What you fucking take time off of your ranch.

724
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.930
You drive through a bad neighborhood in Vegas and you decide you've got to

725
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:24.150
fucking a synopsis of black people.
Like,
Holy Shit,

726
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.800
this is the guy you fucking people got behind a guy who's this nutty fuck was

727
00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:31.320
letting his cows roam all over the place eating grass.

728
00:41:31.321 --> 00:41:36.110
He doesn't want to pay for it.
Like it's,
it's bizarre.
It's a very bizarre thing.

729
00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:37.130
But they saw him,

730
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.110
they saw this Bundy character as sort of this poster guy for,
uh,

731
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.300
you know,
the America that's

732
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.250
<v 4>fed up with the intrusion of the federal government into our lives and the</v>

733
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.660
Socialist Obama network.

734
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.640
<v 1>And Hannity jumps on board with this and now it just looks like a complete</v>

735
00:41:56.641 --> 00:42:00.540
fucking idiot when more and more of this information comes out about this guy.

736
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.150
<v 2>So he says black people,
but Bundy does black people mooching off the government.</v>

737
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.250
Dude,
you owe the government 1 million bucks

738
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.910
<v 4>a lot more than that.
It was like 9 million or something crazy like that.</v>

739
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.070
So like more than a decade,
right.

740
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.130
The whole point of this controversy is that you're mooching off the government a

741
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.010
lot more than a welfare person.
Right.

742
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.600
And he like literally a million times before there was ever a person.

743
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.970
<v 2>And then imagine if the situation was reversed,</v>

744
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.410
like they decide that they're not going to pay their taxes and Compton reversed

745
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.600
racially,
right?
And then they're like,
oh,
if the government,

746
00:42:32.601 --> 00:42:35.080
he comes here to collect the taxes,
fees,
whatever,

747
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.770
all the black folks in Compton and grab their guns and then they're going to

748
00:42:38.771 --> 00:42:41.110
point them at the federal government and make 'em back down.

749
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.470
What do you think Hannity's reaction to that would have been like,

750
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:49.000
<v 4>ah,
new Black Panther party destroying the country.
Obama use,</v>

751
00:42:49.001 --> 00:42:50.230
how can he do this?

752
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:54.220
These are good honest cops and your due date or respect authority and all of

753
00:42:54.221 --> 00:42:57.310
these black people in their guns are dangerous.
Right?

754
00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.320
White militia shows up with guns.

755
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.130
<v 2>Fuck the federal government.
It's fascinating.</v>

756
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:06.900
<v 1>Yeah,
it is fascinating.
And those people that did show up,
I,
you know,</v>

757
00:43:06.901 --> 00:43:07.670
I the,

758
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.740
the real problem with any of those subjects is that people have this sort of

759
00:43:10.741 --> 00:43:13.950
knee jerk side.
Did they take this knee jerk reaction they take,

760
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:18.210
you see a bunch of cops with dogs and they're telling us rancher and you think

761
00:43:18.211 --> 00:43:19.380
of a rancher as a farmer,

762
00:43:19.381 --> 00:43:23.190
you think of a farmer is America the backbone of America?
Guy was farming,

763
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.120
you know,
but this is a lot going on here.
This is a,

764
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.150
this is a big fucking long complicated tale and you can't,

765
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.260
you can't describe it in five minutes and you can't break it down to a guy like

766
00:43:34.261 --> 00:43:37.020
Sean Hannity that has a billion other fucking things on his mind.

767
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.970
He just sees it as a category.
Oh,
it's on the right,
right.
Support White people.

768
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.550
Yeah.
They don't want the Obama,
we've got a black president and fuck yeah,

769
00:43:44.551 --> 00:43:45.840
run with it.
You know,
it's like,

770
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:50.870
it's this really complex issue that they just shuffle in and it kind of

771
00:43:51.781 --> 00:43:56.190
highlights why that system sucks.
I mean it's one of the best stories.

772
00:43:56.191 --> 00:43:59.070
One of the best recent stories to highlight why this,

773
00:43:59.071 --> 00:44:03.720
this right left paradigm on,
on television really suck six.

774
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.720
<v 2>So one of my big surprises when I got into the talk show world was how stupid</v>

775
00:44:07.721 --> 00:44:12.220
Sean Hannity's.
And honestly,
because like when I went in,
I was like,

776
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.420
I thought,
okay,
look,

777
00:44:13.421 --> 00:44:16.780
if I get make it on TV and I might have to debate like somebody like Sean

778
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.550
Hannity,
I got to really come correct,
right.

779
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.370
I got to make sure that I've got all my information,

780
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.200
etc. And then as I heard him throughout the years,
I'd be like,
wait,
wait,

781
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:30.220
those two cloths are not connected that there was no logical nexus.
Right.

782
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.820
I'm like,
and then I realize,
oh my God,

783
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:36.420
he's just going from one talking point to another.
He's another news actor,

784
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:40.530
but he's paid to be like conservative Republican propaganda news actor.

785
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.570
He's just reading the shit.
He's just,
he knows like he never makes logical sense.

786
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.350
It's like you could be republican or you could be conservative like Ron Paul.

787
00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:52.800
He makes sense like you agree or disagree,
but he,
you go,
okay,

788
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:55.770
I understand the logical jumps he's making here,
and he's like,
no,

789
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:57.800
this is my talking point on how I hate Obama.

790
00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.580
The next thing sounds like the exact opposite,

791
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.540
but it's still talking boy and about,
I hate Obama,
and so I was like,
Oh wow,

792
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:05.730
these guys are dumb.
Oh,
this is going to be easy.

793
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:12.130
<v 1>I don't know if it's dumb as much as it's not thought out.</v>

794
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.150
It's,
it's,
there's no,
there's a,

795
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:20.320
there's also no motivation to be like open minded or objective or look at it

796
00:45:21.561 --> 00:45:22.430
from a different angle.

797
00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:25.820
The motivation has to fall into a category that's easy to profit off.

798
00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.180
<v 2>Yeah.
So you're right.
And they get paid to be on a certain team.
I mean,
look,</v>

799
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:32.430
I went through that at Msnbc and so

800
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.180
<v 1>what was that like?
Cause that you're uniquely qualified to discuss this,
right?</v>

801
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.580
Cause he'd been behind the scenes.

802
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.960
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
so,
and,
and just to be clear,</v>

803
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.410
they're not all dumb and bill O'Reilly and he's a really smart guy,
you know,

804
00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:47.290
agree or disagree.
I mean,
that guy knows how to do broadcasts.

805
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.230
<v 1>Tide comes in,
the tide comes out.
You can't explain.
You can't explain that.</v>

806
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.050
Not one of his top moments.

807
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.860
Maybe it is because maybe he shows what he's doing.

808
00:45:56.861 --> 00:46:00.460
He's playing all this fucking monkeys out there that agree with them just

809
00:46:00.461 --> 00:46:03.430
sucking money out of their accounts.
But at least he knows how to play to them.

810
00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:04.320
Right.

811
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:09.270
<v 2>So he's bright in that sense.
Unlike Hannah Day thing.
So Repo,</v>

812
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:14.310
so the guys on the right,
they are writing a certain gravy train,

813
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:18.150
right.
Whether it's a conservative talk guys or the Fox News guys.

814
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.990
And you can't get off that gravy train because I remember when we were first

815
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:24.340
starting out,
uh,
sent my,
our tape,

816
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.860
the young Turks tape to a station in Minnesota and guys like,
I loved it,

817
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:32.220
the program director.
I'm like,
oh great.
So what are you thinking?
What time slot?

818
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:35.040
And he's like,
no,
no,
no time slot.
I said,
why?
He said,

819
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.170
everyone we have here is conservative on there.
I can't,
they'll,

820
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.420
if I put you on the air people,

821
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.620
my audience will hate you and then they will hate me.
Right?

822
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.820
So if you want to be on this station,
you have to be conservative.

823
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:52.350
So if those guys had a genuine change of opinion,
right?

824
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.910
Well they did lose their jobs because they couldn't be on that station anymore.

825
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.030
You see what I'm saying?

826
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.990
So if you're a local guy in Minnesota doing conservative talk,

827
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.870
you have to keep doing conservative talk,
otherwise you can't feed your family.

828
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.650
There is no liberal talk station,
you know,
especially back then,
then there was,

829
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:09.300
now there's a couple left around.

830
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.750
So that's one reason why they stay on the team that they're in and they are not

831
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:14.760
interested in listening to your ideas.

832
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.870
Now what I was at Msnbc as I found out,

833
00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:23.150
it turns out they were team Democrat and it's one thing to be conservatives and

834
00:47:23.151 --> 00:47:25.710
the ad or to be progressive.
I think that's totally fine.

835
00:47:25.711 --> 00:47:30.100
The Nation is a progressive magazine.
That's who they are,
right?
Um,

836
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.540
we're progressive.
That's who we are,
but we're not on team Democrat.
Uh,
like,

837
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:36.940
so if a Democrat is not doing something progressive,

838
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:41.260
we're going to call them out.
To me that's like obvious.
I don't even,

839
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.510
I had trouble comprehending that other people didn't think that way.
Right.

840
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.980
To them cares what your ideas are,
man.
Who killed your principals?

841
00:47:50.981 --> 00:47:53.020
What are you talking about?
Right,
right.
No,
no,
no.

842
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.070
This is team Democrat and you stay on this team.
So I mean,

843
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:59.040
I don't know if he ever heard the story,
but like the,

844
00:47:59.041 --> 00:48:03.210
the reason I left Msnbc is I got a speech from the head of the network,

845
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.780
Phil Griffin,
who said,
hey,
look man,
I love to be an outsider.

846
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:11.350
Outsiders wear leather jackets,
they ride motorcycles,
they're super cool.
But

847
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.400
<v 4>I'm like,
oh,
I didn't know that.
I've never written a motorcycle.
Most guys,</v>

848
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:19.970
they kind of scare me,
but I said,
yeah.
He said,

849
00:48:19.971 --> 00:48:20.990
but this is NBC,
right?

850
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.240
<v 2>Were insiders,
and I was just in Washington.</v>

851
00:48:24.241 --> 00:48:29.190
They're not happy with your tone and we're the establishment here and you got to

852
00:48:29.191 --> 00:48:30.090
start acting like it.

853
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:34.680
<v 4>Wow.
Amazing.
It's not just amazing.
It's like a scene in a movie.</v>

854
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.520
Exactly.
That's what I always say.
I felt like I was at a movie and I was like,

855
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.790
I'm like,
dude.
And maybe maybe he got off on that.
Maybe he felt like

856
00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.820
<v 2>he was in a movie and he was going to give this big speech.
Right.</v>

857
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.520
But as I talked to,
I don't want to name the person,

858
00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:51.710
but I talked to another anchor that was there and that we had lunch and that

859
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:56.360
person was like,
why did he say that to you?
Like that's such a,

860
00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:57.530
you're supposed to be more subtle

861
00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.940
<v 4>than that.
Like that was such a stupid thing to say.
And especially you,</v>

862
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:02.350
you came out of the Internet,
you,

863
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:06.280
the whole thing is like truth telling and being super progressive.

864
00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:09.190
Why did he say that to you?
And not even give you a raise?

865
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:12.550
Why he's telling you the way to do it is to say,
listen,
we're in,

866
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.570
you're an insider.
So here's,
I have a new package for you.
Right?

867
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:21.610
And this packages,
you know,
shares and this and see Joe,
that's,
you nailed it.

868
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.390
You nailed it.
Because that's what came next.
No.
Okay.
So,

869
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.800
so in that speech,

870
00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.730
<v 2>uh,
I'm,
uh,</v>

871
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:32.900
I've been working at Msnbc as a host and then Keith urban leaves,

872
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.210
they give me the six o'clock slot,
right?

873
00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:40.310
And I'm on there from January to April.
Okay.
At that point,

874
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:45.350
April,
I get the speech and I think to myself,
fuck that,
I'm not doing that.
Right.

875
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.320
I will go the opposite direction.
I'll criticize Obama more.

876
00:49:48.321 --> 00:49:50.150
I'll criticized the Democrats more,
right?

877
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.870
Because I don't want to play their game.
And then like get mediocre ratings.

878
00:49:53.871 --> 00:49:54.704
And then they say you got,

879
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:58.790
so I turned it on between April and the beginning of July.

880
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.330
I'm murdered in the ratings,
highest ratings they ever got at six o'clock.
Okay.

881
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.400
Cause I was more me.
And so like in stylistically I listened to them.

882
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:10.790
They would say like be more senatorial.
I'm like,
why would you want to do that?

883
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.280
<v 4>My sits or senators or the most boring people I've ever met.</v>

884
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:18.280
Why would you want to do that?
Right.
That's crazy.
Anyway,
so,

885
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:22.250
<v 2>uh,
I open it up and then at the end of June,</v>

886
00:50:22.251 --> 00:50:27.140
Phil calls me back in two to your point.
Right.
And he's like Jank um,

887
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:31.010
we decided we're going to put you on the weekends.
Not on prime time.
It's six.

888
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.490
Okay.
And when you give that to somebody else,
I was like,
oh that's interesting.

889
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.830
Like I thought I was prepared for it because I had gotten the speech a couple of

890
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.260
months earlier about kind of,
yeah.
And I knew that's when I was like,

891
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.450
I'm done with this.
Right.

892
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:47.060
Like if they want to keep me cause I got a kickass readings,
great.
I'd love it.

893
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.980
Okay.
As long as they let me say what I'm going to say.

894
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:53.900
If they don't want to keep me,
fuck.
Okay.
So he pulls me in and I said,
okay,

895
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:58.040
fill.
So let's go through a quick exercise.
Here are my ratings.
Good lollies.

896
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.860
Can't deny it.
They're,
yeah,
they're the best they've gotten at six.
Yeah,

897
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:04.190
they're great.
I'm like,
is anybody,
am I dick?

898
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.340
Like is anybody in the building said Hey genx and dig.
So he's hard to work with,

899
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:11.330
right?
Nope.
Great.
Like everybody likes you in the building,
right?
Yeah.

900
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.160
And every like great relationships,
right?
Um,
I said,

901
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:20.120
so if you put me on the weekends and it's not related to the speech,
right,

902
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.050
then how would I ever get out of the weekends,
right?
Like within,

903
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:27.320
what is it related to like Efi murdered on the weekends.

904
00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:30.920
I already murdered a six o'clock right on the rating,
so we can't,
and I saw,

905
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:34.910
I said,
what is it?
And he stood there for about 30 seconds without any answer.

906
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.110
And I was like,
wow.
And then he said,
I'll double your seller.

907
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:47.180
Oh,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
I'll double your salary.
But what,

908
00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:50.310
I'll double your salary and put you on the weekends still.
Yes.

909
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.600
So you go from prime time to weekends,

910
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:58.630
but they offered me literally double my salary and for three year contract,

911
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.530
so they thought there's no way I'm going to turn that kind of money down.

912
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:07.430
Like I've been a struggling radio hosts and then internet host my whole life at

913
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:08.390
that point.
Right.

914
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.500
There's no way I'm going to turn that down and you know,

915
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:17.420
look,
it's easy to say they don't know me,
Ha,
I'm a tough guy,
Yada Yada.

916
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:21.920
But the reality is what they underestimated was the size of our audience.

917
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.160
I knew that I could go online,
which I never left.

918
00:52:25.161 --> 00:52:27.470
I did the online show while I was at Msac for were like,
well,

919
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:29.720
you already got on TV,
what do you still bothering with online things?

920
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.450
But I'm like,
no,
no,
no.
You schmucks the real deals online.

921
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:37.100
So I had the luxury of being able to go back to this giant audience online and

922
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:41.210
telling them to fuck off.
That's beautiful.
And explaining your story.
Yeah,

923
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.100
you see that's exactly it.

924
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:47.480
You nailed it again because part of the reason they get double your salary is so

925
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:52.160
you shut up.
Okay.
So they say,
oh progressive's,

926
00:52:52.161 --> 00:52:54.320
what are you talking about?
I got this fire breather,

927
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.740
Janky Yoga from the young Turks on on the weekends.
He's part of our staple.

928
00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.710
Ask them,
ask them and then you have to come out and be like,
yes,

929
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:02.210
MSNBC is very good.

930
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:04.790
They like progressing and you're thinking about your boat and you think about

931
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:07.280
your vacation house and you're thinking about your vacations.

932
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.210
You're thinking of all this shit that that money provides you.
Yeah.
Oh,

933
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:15.740
then I got young kids and,
and look,
if you didn't have the luxury that I had,

934
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.100
think about if you're in one in one of the other hosts position,

935
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.850
there is no fall back.
The fallback is a cliff.

936
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.310
You either going to get paid really well going to be a star.

937
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:30.300
They treat you so well when you're there.
Car Rides everywhere,
first class,

938
00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:34.350
everywhere,
etc. Or You faced the abyss.

939
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.080
Nothing.
And Yeah,

940
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.290
<v 1>you were almost,
you become an hireable.
That's right.</v>

941
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:43.340
If you don't work well with MSNBC,
why would CNBC pick you up?

942
00:53:43.341 --> 00:53:46.450
Why would this network or that network pick you up?
They wouldn't.

943
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.790
<v 2>The word goes out in the street.
He doesn't play ball.</v>

944
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:52.160
<v 1>D a Oberman thing was an interesting thing cause I don't,
I don't know.</v>

945
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:56.540
Keith Olbermann I've,
I've heard is difficult,
you know,
in a lot of ways.

946
00:53:56.541 --> 00:54:00.590
But it's fascinating to see him go from being this fireball,

947
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.160
anti government crusader,
this sort of like,

948
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:07.880
I mean he kind of in a,
in a classic sense,

949
00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:12.560
sort of an Edward r Murrow character and then now he's talking about baseball.

950
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:13.970
It's weird.

951
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:18.970
Like I watched him on ESPN and I'm waiting for like these fiery political

952
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.500
statements,
these,
uh,

953
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:25.760
these big strong monologues that he used to cry.
I mean,

954
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.270
they were very long winded.

955
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.580
The monologues could have done with some editing for sure.
Right?
I mean,

956
00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:35.780
some of there was so verbose and obvious and they reeked of ego because it

957
00:54:35.781 --> 00:54:37.190
wasn't just a statement.

958
00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:40.910
It was him trying to make a statement in an eloquent way that would be

959
00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:43.940
impressive.
Like it smelled like that.
Like you picked it.
I'd be like,

960
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.840
I don't think this is good.
You know,
like I get,
I'm with them,

961
00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:50.990
I'm on a lot of shit,
but as Donald like it,
I don't like your monologues.

962
00:54:50.991 --> 00:54:53.210
They just as two d they're too long.
There's too,

963
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.800
there's too much funkiness in him.

964
00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:00.230
<v 2>So Obama,
oh,
oh,
per month over month.
So that's like the Ubermensch.</v>

965
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.380
Yeah.
Um,
he's a complicated character.

966
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.130
Lots of upsides and lots of downsides.
And so,
um,

967
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.380
the upside to what you're discussing,

968
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:14.210
other commentaries that he did was that he changed the face of television before

969
00:55:14.211 --> 00:55:16.730
that it was all conservative.
Okay.

970
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:21.680
And he did it despite MSNBC,
say under penalty of law,

971
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:25.610
do not do that special comment on the show and overcoming being crazy.

972
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.970
That was the upside of crazy.
He's like,
hmm,
that's Kinda your opinion,
man.
Right.

973
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:32.090
My opinion is I'm going to go do this commentary.

974
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.550
And when it worked and it got such great ratings,

975
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.120
then management got behind him and pretended to be on his side the whole time.

976
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:38.550
Like Yelp,

977
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:42.360
<v 1>of course.
Special comments.
Sure.</v>

978
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:46.570
<v 2>And they realized that there was a racket to be had and team Democrat,
right.</v>

979
00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.900
But at least Oberman even the score,
it was like,
okay,

980
00:55:49.901 --> 00:55:54.580
now he had MSNBC doing democratic talking points and I'm not taking anything

981
00:55:54.581 --> 00:55:58.000
away from open up over him and I think he's principled on his politics.
Uh,

982
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.470
and then you had to re Foxton who's doing it.
So that was a huge breakthrough.

983
00:56:02.471 --> 00:56:06.820
So he's kind of a historic figure in that sense.
Um,
on the other hand,
he's crazy.

984
00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.360
Like,
just crazy.
Like in what way?

985
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:16.140
<v 1>Okay.
Folks,
not listening,
genx eyebrow,
but way up.
His eyes got very lucky.</v>

986
00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:21.970
<v 2>And so that's why they put into was ESPN contract and he's not allowed to talk</v>

987
00:56:21.971 --> 00:56:26.950
about politics.
Right?
That's why he's,
and he loves sports.
That's genuine,
right?

988
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:30.220
So he's just doing sports and he's look a great example.

989
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:33.820
It was actually Bandfield back when,
uh,

990
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:38.070
MSNBC was conservative before the Obermann special comments and stuff around the

991
00:56:38.071 --> 00:56:41.440
rack war.
Right,
exactly.
As the Iraq war was happening,

992
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:46.390
she did this speech at a college in Kansas and said,
this is crazy.

993
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:50.830
The Iraq war is,
we shouldn't do this.
And explain why.
Really eloquent,

994
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:54.940
really smart.
MSNBC said,
yeah,
you're off there.
Okay.

995
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.570
And they literally moved her into a closet.
And so,
uh,

996
00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:01.720
they see we're not going to let you out of your contract.

997
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:02.770
You're not allowed to say that.

998
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.550
And they moved her office and do a closet that sent a message to everybody.

999
00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:09.010
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Okay.

1000
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.540
And so if you don't play team ball,
ah,
that's the fate that way too.

1001
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:14.703
And so,

1002
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:16.210
<v 0>okay.</v>

1003
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:20.740
<v 2>Keith has kind of been banished into the closet of sports.</v>

1004
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.820
Like it's a closet we like,
I like sports,
he likes sports,

1005
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.520
but they're not going to let him out again

1006
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.640
<v 1>to talk about politics.
Why does it need go on the online,</v>

1007
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.810
<v 2>right?
Probably too old school.
It's hard for them to figure it out.
I mean,</v>

1008
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:38.920
look man,
you're going to go online like you do a,
we do.
You gotta be hungry,

1009
00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:39.430
right?

1010
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:43.990
You gotta be ready to roll up your sleeves and take a lot of shit and get

1011
00:57:43.991 --> 00:57:46.450
battered and then get back up and stuff.

1012
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.750
Those old school guys who've made a conciliation dollars,

1013
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.823
they don't have it in him.

1014
00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:55.060
<v 1>That's interesting.
That's an interesting comment.
Um,
yeah,
I you,</v>

1015
00:57:55.061 --> 00:57:58.320
you definitely can get too used to that whole system of everything being set up

1016
00:57:58.321 --> 00:57:58.950
for you.

1017
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:03.950
Like I have a buddy who does a podcast and he does a podcast on a network and

1018
00:58:04.501 --> 00:58:07.920
the network is owned by a major television network and they were censoring his

1019
00:58:07.921 --> 00:58:11.910
podcast and I was like,
what the fuck are you doing man?
This is a podcast.

1020
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.330
The last thing you want is someone telling you what you can and can't say and

1021
00:58:15.331 --> 00:58:18.720
taking the bad words out of your mouth on the fucking Internet.
Are you crazy?

1022
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.230
Or you're ruining everything that's great about the Internet and doing it this

1023
00:58:22.231 --> 00:58:26.460
way.
Yeah.
But he was like,
why do I do it?
Outside of that,
I'm like,
oh,
come on man,

1024
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:29.790
you fucking get a microphone.
You plug it into an MP,

1025
00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:33.570
three recorder and you start talking and then you take that and then you throw

1026
00:58:33.571 --> 00:58:36.870
it online.
It's that simple.
And if it grows,
it grows.

1027
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:40.140
You throw seeds out the window.
Some of them won't become trees,
you know,

1028
00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:41.750
it just fucking do it.
Just do it.

1029
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.470
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1030
00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:46.160
<v 1>too much work.
Too much thinking too outside the box.</v>

1031
00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.430
Plus a guy like Keith who's been on TV for,
so I keep calling him Keith,
like I,

1032
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:53.060
we're friends,
but we're not,
I mean,
so do you know him?

1033
00:58:53.061 --> 00:58:54.140
Have you had conversations with him?

1034
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:57.560
I've had a couple conversations with them on a one to 10.
Wackiness

1035
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:04.700
10.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Strong.
Um,
now I want him as a guest.

1036
00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.200
I wouldn't bring him on.

1037
00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.810
Is He allowed to do interviews where he talks about politics,

1038
00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:12.410
where he talks about things?
I would be shocked,
but I dunno.
I bet he's not right.

1039
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:14.210
I bet they'd fucking trapped him.

1040
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.660
<v 2>Plus I bet he doesn't do it.
So like if you are on TV,</v>

1041
00:59:18.661 --> 00:59:21.800
Rachel Maddow gave me a great speech before I ever got on TV.

1042
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.780
A warning me about TV.
Okay.

1043
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:27.530
Because we used to work together to America and then she was really helpful and

1044
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:31.280
stuff at Msnbc and she's like,
just,

1045
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.220
it'll get into your head.
Don't let it get into your head,
man,

1046
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.220
because you take one too many limo rides,

1047
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:40.340
you'll have one too many people telling you how great you are,

1048
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.440
and then you lose track of what reality is.
And so a guy like Overman,

1049
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:48.530
who's been on TV for so long and so successful for so long,

1050
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.070
he spins into an orbit where he thinks he can't do anything wrong.

1051
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:56.570
And then like the ego becomes so gigantic that it can't be punctured.

1052
00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.370
So if he were to go online,
it would get punctured.
Right.
You know,

1053
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:05.810
you like,
there's a lot of compliments online,
but there's a lot of criticism,

1054
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.660
right,
and an ego that large cannot handle that.

1055
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.280
<v 1>Yeah,
I agree.
I think that I find great benefit in that criticism.
I mean,</v>

1056
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:16.550
I know that some of it is completely unfounded and some of it is just a hundred

1057
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.320
percent douche bags that are just assholes.

1058
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:22.400
And you go to their Twitter page and you'll see just them just shitting on one

1059
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:25.970
person after another.
Just random people that they don't know.
Celebrities,

1060
01:00:25.971 --> 01:00:30.860
common ners people on that have blogs,
whatever,
and just,

1061
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:33.800
just hate,
hate,
hate.
Hate,
hate this.
There's folks like that.

1062
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.310
There's also folks that will say something that you don't want to hear,

1063
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:38.270
but you should hear it.

1064
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:42.980
And you take that into consideration and it'll make you better.
It really well.

1065
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.660
And there's the Obor mens are the people that don't want to engage in that.
Your,

1066
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:49.880
yeah,
your ego's going to take a beating,

1067
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:53.480
but your fucking ego should take a beating you.
He goes a dangerous thing.

1068
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:55.880
And if it grows too much,
it can,
it can,

1069
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.840
it can create a canopy that doesn't let all the other things grow underneath it.

1070
01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:05.530
<v 2>That's 100%.
Right.
So,
uh,
some people hate the comments section on Youtube.</v>

1071
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:07.270
I don't,
I love it.
I mean,

1072
01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:11.140
I know there's mental people on there and if you listen to every comment,

1073
01:01:11.141 --> 01:01:15.580
you're gonna lose your mind.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Right?
But overall,

1074
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:20.050
if most people,
if 80% of the is agreeing to something,

1075
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:24.400
it's almost certainly correct.
So if,
if they tell you,
hey,

1076
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:28.780
you're going in this wrong direction,
well,
I take note of that man.
And I just,

1077
01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.690
if you don't adjust,
they're trying to help you.
You know what they are,

1078
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:35.650
they're in the new media,
they're your editor right there,
your editor saying,
Hey,

1079
01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:38.840
don't do that.
You look like an asshole.
Do this.
Okay.

1080
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:42.370
And if 80% of them agree on something,
I've never seen it be wrong.

1081
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:43.490
<v 1>And sometimes there's a,</v>

1082
01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:47.550
there's a thing that you're doing when you're discussing an issue.
Uh,
we're,

1083
01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.750
we're where someone might have a criticism on it and it's one of the things that

1084
01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.170
I like about doing this show is it,

1085
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:55.070
this show is three hours long and one of the things in having a three hour

1086
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:59.840
conversation is that you get to really thoroughly discuss a point because you

1087
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.760
could take snippets out of a lot of things.

1088
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:06.410
Like there was a thing they did on real sports the other day about a Fallon Fox,

1089
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:07.550
you know,
Fallon Fox is,

1090
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.990
she's a woman who used to be a man who decided to get a sex change and then

1091
01:02:11.991 --> 01:02:16.640
fight and women's MMA.
And I,
me as a martial arts expert,

1092
01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:17.090
I was like,

1093
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:22.090
I do not agree with that at all because there's certain undeniable advantages of

1094
01:02:22.381 --> 01:02:25.890
the human frame,
of the male frame and when it comes to combat sports,

1095
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.970
when it comes to being a woman or being transgender,
I'm 100% supportive it.

1096
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.970
I've used to be able to do whatever you want,
man.
If you want to marry your desk,

1097
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.890
I'm,
I'm for it.
If you want to live with cats in the woods,
I don't give a fuck.

1098
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.300
It just don't hurt anybody.

1099
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:42.840
I couldn't care less and if you decide that you identify as a woman,

1100
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:44.940
you want to be a woman,
I'm 100% in support of that.

1101
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.450
I couldn't imagine what it's like to be that person and have these feelings and

1102
01:02:49.451 --> 01:02:53.890
to have them rejected by society.
I'm fully in sympathy and support of it.

1103
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.160
Real sports.
He uses one like five second thing of me saying,
first of all,

1104
01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:03.950
it's not a woman.
It's not.
She has a y chromosome.
I mean,
I'll,

1105
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.650
I'll call her a woman,
but you,

1106
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.090
when science finds her body a thousand years from now,
they're going to go,
oh,

1107
01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:13.200
that was a man.
You know,
and when it comes to combat sports,
when it comes to,

1108
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.290
when it comes to social interaction,
when it comes to culture,

1109
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.130
when it comes to how you treat people,
I'm fully in support of transgenders,

1110
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.400
but as a person who was a professional mixed martial arts commentator and who's

1111
01:03:25.771 --> 01:03:27.720
lived my entire life training in martial arts,

1112
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.590
I'm very aware of the distinct advantages of the male frame.
That's just,

1113
01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:34.740
it's just that simple.
There's a reason why we don't let men fight women.

1114
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.040
And when you didn't disclose the fact that she used to be a man anyway,

1115
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:43.590
real sports takes five seconds of that and throws it out there.

1116
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.250
That's the difference between a podcast and a television show and it television

1117
01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:51.810
show.
That five seconds becomes a three hour discussion where you go over all the

1118
01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:54.840
aspects of the emotional,

1119
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:58.710
the damage that you must get.
Being a child,

1120
01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:02.970
wanting to be a woman and being a man and all the different realities of what

1121
01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:07.650
makes you a person and whether it's a learned experience or whether it's

1122
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:09.190
genetics or all these devices,

1123
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:13.080
subtle variations and trying to put yourself into that mindset.

1124
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.390
There's so much to be said on so many different subjects,

1125
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:17.340
but when you're on a fucking television show,

1126
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.670
you don't get a chance when you're dealing with those seven minute things on red

1127
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:24.990
eye on Fox,
and it's like,
and what's your take on global warming?
Real,
not real.

1128
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:28.500
Jank you know,
and you're like,
well,
the,
the statistics say,

1129
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:31.740
who's making this statistics?
We'll be right back with commercials like you,

1130
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:33.570
fuck you're not,
you're not getting,

1131
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.180
you're not getting to talk about things enough.
There's,

1132
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:38.850
there's too much information.

1133
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:43.970
There's too many subtle variations in thought that need to be sort of explored

1134
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:47.130
when you,
when you delve into any sort of subject.

1135
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:51.960
And I think that when we're talking about this whole right left paradigm and

1136
01:04:51.961 --> 01:04:56.961
this whole team Democrat thing that you faced when you were on MSNBC or the the

1137
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:00.660
team Republican that Sean Hannity is a part of,

1138
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:06.060
that sort of embodies the whole problem with television that really doesn't

1139
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:08.550
exist in the same form on the Internet.

1140
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:12.890
You're going to have people that agree and disagree in the Internet,
but in,

1141
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:14.400
in a format like this,

1142
01:05:14.401 --> 01:05:19.300
you get to really cover a subject and really sort of let down your guard and

1143
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:23.320
explore all the variables that TV doesn't let you do.

1144
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:24.160
<v 2>Look,</v>

1145
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.160
I miss our radio show so much because me Ben and chill pike at the time,

1146
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:33.820
we'd come in and we do a three hour show and we just have the time of our lives.

1147
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:38.530
We can do that.
No,
well it's because every format is different,
right?

1148
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.760
And so our show is built for being online video.

1149
01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:44.830
So I got to squeeze it,

1150
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.720
squeeze in as many topics as I can into the two hours that we do.
Uh,

1151
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:53.740
so we can clip them up and put them up on Youtube.
Okay.
But I can't,

1152
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.370
but I'm not going to do,
I'm going to do them justice.
Right?

1153
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.400
So I'm going to take as long as I need,
but not a second more.

1154
01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:05.580
So I've done like 17 minute explanations of a topic cause it needed 17 minutes.

1155
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:11.050
Right.
It might be the NSA wiretapping whatever.

1156
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:14.530
But I needed to explain that and I explained it so I'm not rushing through

1157
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:16.660
anything.
But at the same time,

1158
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:20.530
I can't have a conversation like this because this is great for a podcast.

1159
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:23.620
That's why your podcast as well and it does great.
Um,

1160
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.860
but if you put this up on Youtube,
people are gonna be like,
wow,
three hours.

1161
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.840
<v 1>Well we do put it on Youtube.
Well,
I hear you.
We just started recently.</v>

1162
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:33.693
Like wait a year ago.

1163
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.140
<v 2>Yeah,
about a year ago.
Yeah.</v>

1164
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:38.110
So it's just a different format and I've done all those different formats,

1165
01:06:38.111 --> 01:06:42.400
but I miss the radio days.
Like we'd walk in in a t shirt,

1166
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.950
like you didn't have to worry about your forehead.

1167
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:49.210
You're 90 you're shining the powder you up for the young Turks.
I on myself

1168
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:53.350
in the beginning.
I remember when I was in Miami,

1169
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.460
I always thought the signal for success was if you got makeup,

1170
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.370
you knew you made it if you were getting makeup.
Okay.
That's great.
Yeah.
And then,

1171
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.820
but then when I was on TV,
I hated makeup because I,
it felt,

1172
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.300
it felt like it was a symbol of the fakeness of television to cake it on you and

1173
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:16.310
then you feel like one of these like Shepard Smith.
Yeah.
You,

1174
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:21.340
if you feel like you're in the capitol,
you know,
in hunger games,
like,
you know,

1175
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:24.760
they've put on this makeup and you go out there and you entertain the masses,

1176
01:07:24.761 --> 01:07:28.390
whatever.
I Dunno.
I,
so now I just put on my own,
I figured out,

1177
01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:32.500
is this a hilarious conversation but what foundation works best for me?

1178
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.810
And so like five minutes before the show,
I'll,
I'll go in the uh,

1179
01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:41.770
in the bathroom and I'll put it on and it's not caked on it just so that my

1180
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:42.970
forehead doesn't shine.

1181
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:47.490
<v 1>Yeah.
I signed like a motherfucker,
but I do also during the,</v>

1182
01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:49.910
the UFC they tried to,
well they don't now,

1183
01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:53.280
but they tried in the early days to powder me up.
You know the,

1184
01:07:53.281 --> 01:07:56.420
the other guys that I work with get powdered up.
They put the makeup on you.

1185
01:07:56.421 --> 01:07:58.430
I'm like behind me,
I'm going to get,

1186
01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:00.770
people are going to get kicked in the fucking face.

1187
01:08:00.771 --> 01:08:02.990
Their head's going to swell up like the elephant man.

1188
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.940
And you're worried if my skin is shiny,

1189
01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:07.940
there's no way I'm letting you touch me with that shit.
We're going to fight.

1190
01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.590
You try to fucking powder me up.

1191
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.590
We're going to have a real problem because this is ridiculous.

1192
01:08:12.591 --> 01:08:16.610
This is what I look like.
All this shit.
If I have a Zit,
I have a Zit.

1193
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.593
So what I look like,

1194
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:22.320
<v 2>my problem is that if you don't put at least something to take the shine off,</v>

1195
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:26.970
it looks like I'm sweating like a maniac.
I'm not,
but it looks like,
right,
right,

1196
01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:31.140
right.
One skin.
You're,
you're oily.
Yeah,
I'm Mediterranean,
so I,
yeah.

1197
01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:35.580
So I once I was super late for an interview,

1198
01:08:35.581 --> 01:08:38.970
I was going to do with some guy who was the rhino hunter or whatever,

1199
01:08:38.971 --> 01:08:41.880
and I jumped in the seat.
I didn't do the foundation.

1200
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.790
And he's conservative and he's a hunter.
Right?

1201
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:48.750
<v 1>Is this the guy who won that?
Oh Wow.</v>

1202
01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.990
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
The guy that was going to kill David and Ryan killed it.
Whoa.
Right.</v>

1203
01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:56.250
So then I come out of the interview and people were like,
Oh yeah,

1204
01:08:56.251 --> 01:08:58.560
I see that guy eat like I scared you.
Right.

1205
01:08:58.561 --> 01:09:01.500
That's why you were sweating like that.
Oh

1206
01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:06.210
yeah.
I'm like,
first of all,
we agreed on like 90% of stuff.

1207
01:09:06.211 --> 01:09:07.230
I don't know what you're talking about,

1208
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.060
but that's the perception that people get.

1209
01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:12.510
So that's why I don't want to seem like I'm sweating like a maniac.

1210
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.300
That's so funny.

1211
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.990
<v 1>They want that perception.
They want that.
They look for that.
They look,
oh,</v>

1212
01:09:16.991 --> 01:09:20.740
he was scared he was skating with every form that opinion before we even sat

1213
01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:21.560
down to talk to them.
Yeah.

1214
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.170
I was scared of what the guy's going to come hunt me down from Texas.
Like,

1215
01:09:25.171 --> 01:09:29.110
you know,
agree with that guys hunting the whole country.
Then if that's the case,

1216
01:09:29.111 --> 01:09:32.650
I mean he's got a hunt 100 million people that are angry at him for wanting to

1217
01:09:32.651 --> 01:09:34.030
shoot that rhino.
Yeah.

1218
01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:36.960
That Rhino story was a very fascinating story because if you,

1219
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:39.050
if you talk to the conservation people that say,

1220
01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:43.480
well at Rhino had to be removed from the herd anyway because it was a larger

1221
01:09:43.481 --> 01:09:47.410
older male and it was trying to kill the young males because it didn't want them

1222
01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:50.470
breeding and it's actually dangerous for the population of the rhinos.

1223
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.390
Like many things,
that whole,
uh,

1224
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.550
African hunting thing is a very confusing and complex issue.

1225
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.870
<v 2>Yep.
He made a really good case for it on the show.</v>

1226
01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.020
<v 1>Well,
we were talking about it with Louis Theroux.
He,
uh,
you know,</v>

1227
01:10:04.021 --> 01:10:08.010
Louis through the documentarian from England,
fascinating guy,

1228
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.090
and he's done some amazing documentaries and one of his best ones was on these

1229
01:10:12.091 --> 01:10:15.420
African hunts and in Africa,

1230
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:20.450
these wild animals that used to be on the verge of extinction are now like in

1231
01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:23.760
the greatest populations we've seen in years.

1232
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.650
Like they're really healthy populations,

1233
01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:29.290
but they're all in these high fence hunting areas,
so their,

1234
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.570
their populations are great,
but people get to pay to kill him.
So I was like,

1235
01:10:33.571 --> 01:10:37.980
Whoa,
that a fucking,
that is humanity in a nutshell right there.

1236
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:39.210
That's society,

1237
01:10:39.211 --> 01:10:43.650
culture and an I just up fucking the weird contradictory nature of the whole

1238
01:10:43.651 --> 01:10:45.390
thing where it's not very black and white.

1239
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.040
There's a lot of weirdness going on there.

1240
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.950
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

1241
01:10:47.951 --> 01:10:51.790
Like I think we get carried away with the conservation mentality.

1242
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:53.830
Here's what I mean by that.
Of course we need conservation,

1243
01:10:53.831 --> 01:10:55.420
but like then they'll be like,
okay,

1244
01:10:55.421 --> 01:11:00.160
well that rhino is an older rhino so he will attack the younger rhinos so it's

1245
01:11:00.161 --> 01:11:03.010
actually better to kill him.
So he doesn't do that.
But I'm like,
wait a minute.

1246
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.510
If we're trying to preserve how they actually live,
that's what older rhinos do.

1247
01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.220
They in fact the younger rhinos,
yes.
They didn't make that up.

1248
01:11:09.221 --> 01:11:10.120
That's in their DNA.

1249
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.500
<v 1>The problem is,
is not enough rhino support that the,
the issue becomes when you,</v>

1250
01:11:14.501 --> 01:11:18.240
you have a large quantity of it,
a large quantity of rhinos,
that's fine.

1251
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.880
That's natural.
It's normal,
right?

1252
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:24.360
But when you have a small herd that could really do some serious damage,

1253
01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.120
<v 2>right?
So that's why it's so complicated.
Like how then,
how do you resolve that?</v>

1254
01:11:29.121 --> 01:11:31.240
Do you let people kill him?
But if you do though,

1255
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:34.820
your whole point was conservation,
why are you letting people execute them?

1256
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:37.340
You know?
But on the other hand in it,
if you don't,

1257
01:11:37.341 --> 01:11:40.700
then maybe you cost yourself three younger rhinos.
And that's a real problem.

1258
01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.480
So the problem is that is humans,
right?

1259
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.710
We've taken over everything.
We're the virus,
right?
Yeah.

1260
01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.510
And so since we've taken over everything,
we've got these,

1261
01:11:50.511 --> 01:11:54.500
all these little things in artificial cages,
it might be a small cage in a zoo,

1262
01:11:54.501 --> 01:11:58.180
or it might be a large cage in one of those preserves in Africa.
But essence,

1263
01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.800
we've killed what quote unquote naturally happen.

1264
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:05.430
<v 1>Well,
we've become the stewards of the,
of nature itself.
And we've decided that,</v>

1265
01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:09.060
I mean,
after this point that I've been talking about a lot lately about zoos,

1266
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:12.870
about how terrible it is for the genetics of all these animals,

1267
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:16.380
for them to be isolated.
The idea is that you're preserving these animals.

1268
01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:19.920
You can come see in them,
oh,
we've let these pandas breed that.
Well,
you know,

1269
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.010
here's the reality.
Pan Is they're supposed to breathe if they can,

1270
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.250
if they don't get eaten by tigers because you're supposed to be tigers around

1271
01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:28.220
the pan is or whatever the fuck their natural Predator is.

1272
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:32.100
It's supposed to be jaguars around the monkeys and they're supposed to be lions

1273
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:34.200
around the,
the,
the giraffes.

1274
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:38.400
I mean that's just what happens in nature and when we have them all segregated

1275
01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:40.170
in these apartments and you know,

1276
01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.130
we've slide food under the tray and the tray underneath the door.

1277
01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:48.180
Like why the fuck are we doing here?
Like we're,
we're anti nature here.

1278
01:12:48.181 --> 01:12:52.320
This is everything against,
I mean these things are surviving period.

1279
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.910
No matter what they're surviving.

1280
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.130
<v 2>We're not trying to preserve nature.
We're trying to preserve at time frozen.
Hmm.</v>

1281
01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:02.550
You know,
like nature frozen in time at that time,
right?

1282
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.700
This is what we're used to.
We liked the drafts like this.

1283
01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:09.450
We like the pandas like that and we'd like to preserve it.
But in reality,

1284
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:14.490
nature is not in the conservation business.
No,
it's in the struggle business.

1285
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.030
Right.

1286
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:20.030
And so oftentimes things will go extinct because that's what happened.

1287
01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:23.040
Cause the tigers ate all the pandas Saturday.

1288
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.430
And what'll happen is the panda will then breed with a Koala or whatever.

1289
01:13:26.431 --> 01:13:31.410
I mean to speak incredibly ignorantly and then you'll get a new species.

1290
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:31.600
Right?

1291
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.670
But that's what's awesome about nature because like you don't know what's going

1292
01:13:35.671 --> 01:13:38.640
to happen.
There'll be destruction,
there'll be creation,

1293
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:42.750
but we have short circuited that.
So there is no good answer.
Right?

1294
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.170
The answer isn't a fuck them.
Let them all die.
That's not the answer.

1295
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:50.970
And the answer isn't let's stop all progress in all creation right now.
Right.

1296
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.300
And try to preserve it as it is today.
That's not the answer either.

1297
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.650
So I don't know what the answer is.

1298
01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:55.841
<v 1>Well,</v>

1299
01:13:55.841 --> 01:14:00.100
the answer is also that human beings are a part of nature and that our nature is

1300
01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:01.120
to fuck with things.

1301
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:05.080
And that is nature and it's a very strange thing for us to think about in that

1302
01:14:05.081 --> 01:14:06.760
way.
But all human behavior,

1303
01:14:06.761 --> 01:14:11.761
everything from computers to pollution to t to communication through cell

1304
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:18.220
phones,
all that stuff is natural.
It's just natural with human beings.

1305
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.750
And it's a,
it's a very strange,

1306
01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:24.640
just as natural as a macaw and making weird noises.
And that's natural too.

1307
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:28.000
It just is natural for you to send a Dick pic through your fucking cell phone.

1308
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.070
These are natural things.
It's just,

1309
01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:35.071
it's so complex and so outside of the norm for every other multi-celled species

1310
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:38.410
on the planet that we don't like to think of it.
It's natural.
We look,

1311
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.850
think of it as human created,

1312
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.390
but everything human created is just as natural as a beehive,

1313
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.540
just as natural as an ant hill.
Those are natural as well.

1314
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.800
<v 2>You know,
I never thought about it that way.
But you're right,</v>

1315
01:14:48.801 --> 01:14:52.900
there's nothing more natural than a dick pic because,
no,

1316
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.530
but like literally like,
you know,
Eh,

1317
01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.640
we have larger penises than other primates do because that's part of how we

1318
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.070
attract women.
We swing our dicker rat.

1319
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:07.670
So that's us swinging our dick around over the internet and saying,
Hey,

1320
01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:11.600
anybody interested?
And there's also a direct correlation between the,

1321
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.900
<v 1>the amount of promiscuous females and the size of the male penis.
So it's,</v>

1322
01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:20.310
there's all these slutty women,
God damn problem.
That's why Dick pics exist.

1323
01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:21.950
<v 2>It gets better.
So my,</v>

1324
01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.390
so my favorite thing is just discussing the genetic reasons for the male anatomy

1325
01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:29.160
and female anatomy.
But the,

1326
01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:34.140
so our penis is designed both like a shovel and as a vacuum.

1327
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.250
Okay.

1328
01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.780
And the reason for that is that there is intra-vaginal sperm competition.

1329
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.540
So within the vagina you,

1330
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:47.870
there is an expectation that several different men in the same rough time period

1331
01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:50.010
have ejaculated.

1332
01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:55.340
So our penis is designed to get our seamen n and the other guy's semen out.

1333
01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.140
So that's why our penis is designed like a shovel to shovel out the other guy's

1334
01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:03.300
semen and like a suction.

1335
01:16:03.301 --> 01:16:07.740
So it takes all of the semen that it finds in the vagina before it entered and

1336
01:16:07.741 --> 01:16:12.390
suctions it back out.
So if you think women are monogamous,

1337
01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.900
mm Rdna would tell you otherwise.

1338
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:19.300
<v 1>Yeah.
In small groups and not very monogamous at all.</v>

1339
01:16:19.301 --> 01:16:23.230
That is an interesting thing that the head is designed in that way to plunge out

1340
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.000
sort of as a plunger.
Right.

1341
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.900
And the size of the testicles are in direct correlation to the amount of

1342
01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:31.690
promiscuity females that are around like the with,

1343
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:34.110
with men and tribes that have larger testicles.

1344
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:35.890
Usually the women are more promiscuous.

1345
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.070
That's why chimpanzees have large testicles.
But gorillas,

1346
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:43.240
small testicles and small penises.
Grills have a one inch penis.
Yup.

1347
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.320
Tiny little penis.
It falls out all the time.
You're watched.
Grill is mate.
I have,

1348
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.740
when you watch gorillas mate,
they uh,
they have a hard time keeping it in there.

1349
01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:53.140
There's not a lot of,
a lot of length to work with.

1350
01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:56.320
It's because they have complete total control over the females that are around

1351
01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.220
them.
They have a whole Harem.

1352
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.810
<v 2>Yeah.
Who needs a large penis.
When,
uh,
you know,
if you got any male competition,</v>

1353
01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.710
just crushed her skull.
Yeah.

1354
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:07.930
<v 1>My friend Kevin has a little Dick and he's,
he always admits to it and uh,
he,</v>

1355
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:11.450
he jokes around about it goes,
hey man,
it feels good for me.
I don't care.

1356
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:15.790
<v 2>That's sort of how the girl feels.
Yeah.</v>

1357
01:17:15.791 --> 01:17:20.290
So we have large balls and that means of course the males are also not

1358
01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:22.390
monogamous.
And so we live in this,

1359
01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:27.070
in our own little preserve where we are in monogamous relationships for a

1360
01:17:27.071 --> 01:17:31.480
lifetime,
which is clearly not natural.
And I had a,
um,

1361
01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.240
a guy who does porn on the show last week,

1362
01:17:34.241 --> 01:17:37.300
his name is Dave pounder and he wrote a book about his real name.
Oh,

1363
01:17:37.301 --> 01:17:38.134
of course not.

1364
01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:42.010
He said when he was getting into the porn business is two choices where Dave

1365
01:17:42.011 --> 01:17:46.750
pounder and Dave impaler,
any thought,
eh,
pounder is a little better than impaler.

1366
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:49.180
Okay.
So,
uh,

1367
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:52.240
he did a documentary and a book is a really smart guy.

1368
01:17:52.241 --> 01:17:56.800
Super Smart Guy and he said a guy who's in a longterm relationship that's

1369
01:17:56.801 --> 01:18:01.180
monogamous is like a gay guy in a closet.
Right?
The gay guys at Gay,

1370
01:18:01.181 --> 01:18:05.260
whether he admits it or he doesn't.
Right.
And in your monogamous relationship,

1371
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.960
you're actually polygamous.
Whether he admitted or you don't,

1372
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.090
you're just in the closet about it.
Right?

1373
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:14.320
Cause there's nobody who's actually monogamous.
Do you see what I'm saying?

1374
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:16.840
You can act monogamous,
but you're not monogamous in your mind.

1375
01:18:16.841 --> 01:18:18.280
You're not monogamous in your nature.

1376
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:21.460
So when you don't admit that to your wife or your girlfriend,

1377
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.910
you're just like a gay guy in the closet.
You don't admit what your true nature.

1378
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.480
<v 1>Right.
That's a very fascinating way of putting it.
There's a good friend of mine,</v>

1379
01:18:28.481 --> 01:18:31.150
his doctor,
Chris Ryan,
he has a,
I'm going to call him doctor.

1380
01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.360
I call him Doc Chris Ryan.
I had him on the show sex at dawn.

1381
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.690
We do a podcast together once a month.
It's awesome.

1382
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:41.800
He a Duncan Trussell and myself,
we do this.
We come up with,

1383
01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:44.110
we don't have a name for it.
We call it the shrimp parade sometimes.

1384
01:18:44.111 --> 01:18:48.190
Sometimes it's called the old men and snow because that's what Chris used to

1385
01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:49.930
think about,
to keep himself from orgasming.

1386
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:55.330
He's thinking about old eastern bloc men walking painfully in the snow and that

1387
01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:57.610
would keep him from having an orgasm.
Always having sex.

1388
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.551
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1389
01:18:58.551 --> 01:19:01.370
I'm now going to tell you something I've never told anybody and then I shouldn't

1390
01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:05.150
tell you.
Okay.
But I think that's partly the point of the Joe Rogan podcast.
Okay.

1391
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:08.900
So,
um,
I,
you got to come up with something,
right?
Yeah.

1392
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:11.630
So I used to think about football,
but I'd get really conflicted.

1393
01:19:11.631 --> 01:19:12.980
I'd always think about the chargers,
right?

1394
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.750
Cause I really liked the charge back then,

1395
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.710
but then I'm thinking about dudes and then I was like,
and I'm like,

1396
01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:22.100
I gotta get this Outta my head.
Okay.
But it worked because then I wouldn't come.

1397
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.800
So as partly how you know you're straight with,

1398
01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.690
<v 1>it's also like is a fine line.</v>

1399
01:19:28.691 --> 01:19:30.670
You don't want to think it's about something too fucked up.

1400
01:19:30.671 --> 01:19:33.430
We start to lose your bone and then you're like,
oh no,

1401
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.190
<v 2>exactly.
So you've got all these crazy things going on in your head.
But yes.</v>

1402
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:42.920
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
so,
uh,
Chris Ryan had this conversation where it was,</v>

1403
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.010
we were on the podcast,
he was talking to someone.
It was,
someone was saying,
well,

1404
01:19:46.011 --> 01:19:49.820
look,
I'm monogamous.
And the guy was like,
okay,
we're,
Chris was like,
you're okay.

1405
01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:53.330
Your mom goes,
do you jerk off to porn?
And the guy said,
yes.
He goes,

1406
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.520
well then you're not monogamous unless you're jerking off to porn,

1407
01:19:55.521 --> 01:19:58.610
only have your wife.
You're not monogamous.
You're just,

1408
01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:01.070
you're just monogamous in your actions.
Your mind,

1409
01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:05.330
you have your fantasies are of these other women,
you know?
And that's undeniable.

1410
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:07.890
It's human nature.
It's just,
it's a part being a primate,

1411
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.360
<v 2>even if it's not your wife.</v>

1412
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.420
Does anybody jerk off to this same picture or video in porn to the same woman

1413
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:17.790
every time there's gotta be a guy?
I mean,
I,
yeah,

1414
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.720
there's probably like one or a couple of guys,
but I kind of feel bad for him.

1415
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.410
Dude.
It's a fantasy.
Go nuts.

1416
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:29.130
3 billion women out there as part of having an imagination,
but

1417
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:34.540
<v 1>explore it.
Yeah.
It's a,
it's a,
it's a very fascinating topic because,</v>

1418
01:20:34.541 --> 01:20:38.080
uh,
you know,
with Chris Ryan's book,
sex at dawn,

1419
01:20:38.410 --> 01:20:40.180
he goes into the,

1420
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:45.270
what sort of explores what started out as these tribes of small people,

1421
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.870
you know,

1422
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:51.310
or small groups of 5,150 people that are all living together and you know,

1423
01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:54.340
exchanging sexual partners.
And it was very commonplace.

1424
01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:58.900
And as agriculture gets established and as these populations grow larger and

1425
01:20:58.901 --> 01:21:01.720
larger,
it becomes weirder and weirder.
And then it stops.

1426
01:21:01.721 --> 01:21:05.020
And then we start realizing that our sperm creates that kid.

1427
01:21:05.021 --> 01:21:08.170
And that kid is my kid and I don't want anybody else near my wife who made my

1428
01:21:08.171 --> 01:21:12.120
kid.
And then mail paternity line gets established.
And then,
you know,

1429
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:15.340
the dominance of the breed and really real weird,

1430
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:19.320
weird stuff with human beings when it comes to sexuality and monogamy.
But,

1431
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.330
but fascinating too.
And again,
it's,
you know,
it's more,

1432
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.390
more evidence as to how contradictory are our nature is and how strange.

1433
01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:31.790
<v 2>Yeah.
Being humans trippy.
I mean like where'd these animals,
right?</v>

1434
01:21:31.791 --> 01:21:35.180
That's where we are.
We're animals and we have a certain programming,
you know,

1435
01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.960
we'd sell our DNA is like we're a computer with a program,

1436
01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:42.950
but we're also like animals.
Like we wanna fuck.

1437
01:21:42.951 --> 01:21:47.180
We want to sometimes rip somebody's head off and we have all these urges and we

1438
01:21:47.181 --> 01:21:48.320
have these passions,

1439
01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.680
but yet we're conscious of it all so we can step back and see the animal that we

1440
01:21:53.901 --> 01:21:58.610
are and the robot that we are.
And that's really mind bending.

1441
01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:03.150
<v 1>Yeah,
it is mind bending because it's unique to the,
the,</v>

1442
01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.100
the actual life on this planet.

1443
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:08.970
There's only one at all the animals and the planet.

1444
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:12.840
There might be other animals that are conscious like dolphins and Orca as they

1445
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:14.220
might communicate with each other.

1446
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:18.000
They might have family groups and dialects and all that,

1447
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:21.870
but they don't alter their environment the way we do.
So we're conscious,

1448
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:25.680
we're aware,
we communicate,
we alter our environment and we keep records.

1449
01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.860
You know,
I don't know how much dolphins know about their great,
great,

1450
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:32.580
great grandfathers,
but we know a Shitload,
you know,

1451
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:35.970
and we will quote [inaudible] or we'll,
you know,
we'll,

1452
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:38.490
we'll talk about homer and you know,
we'll,

1453
01:22:38.491 --> 01:22:43.170
we'll discuss people that lived a thousand years ago as if,
you know,

1454
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.280
we know exactly what they were like.
And that is very uniquely human.

1455
01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:52.200
So we sorta chart how retarded we used to be in comparison to how retarded we

1456
01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:55.020
currently are and see this progress.

1457
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:59.630
<v 2>Yeah.
And our nature is oftentimes very much at war with itself.
Uh,</v>

1458
01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.980
and it's a hell of a balanced the pull off.
So yes,
we're polygamists,

1459
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.030
there's no question about that.

1460
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:08.830
The flip side of that is then why does almost every celebrity,

1461
01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.450
and finally we lost George Clooney.

1462
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:15.100
So I can now I think saying every celebrity still get married because if we were

1463
01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:19.600
just polygamous,
you'd be crazy to get married.
If you're a celebrity,

1464
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:22.840
if you're a guy,
right?
You get a hundred girls,
you get a thousand girls,

1465
01:23:22.841 --> 01:23:23.770
why would you get stay?

1466
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.100
Because there's also a part of our nature that wants to nest.

1467
01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:30.880
And that once have a one on one relationship.

1468
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.850
So good luck trying to balance that out.

1469
01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.700
And that's what we struggle with through our whole lives.

1470
01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:42.450
And then you've got our competitive nature and our nature where we cooperate.

1471
01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:47.260
Right?
And everybody makes a mistake of going on one side or another.

1472
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:51.130
Like there'll be a group that thinks no,
people are competitive.
They want to,

1473
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:51.964
you know,

1474
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:55.060
and you're crazy if you're thinking that they were ever going to cooperate.

1475
01:23:55.061 --> 01:23:56.650
And then there's the guys who were like,
Hey,
no,

1476
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.500
people hold their hands together and sing Kumbaya.

1477
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.780
And normally they'd be no war and all that stuff.
No.
Well that's no,

1478
01:24:04.781 --> 01:24:06.370
neither side is true.
No,

1479
01:24:06.371 --> 01:24:09.700
we're sometimes incredibly competitive and want to rip each other's heads off.

1480
01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:13.210
And sometimes we're incredibly cooperative and we worked together to create

1481
01:24:13.211 --> 01:24:16.030
great things.
It's a balance.
So look,

1482
01:24:16.031 --> 01:24:21.031
in a lot of ways it's awesome because if the world was black and white,

1483
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.780
it'd be too easy.

1484
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.771
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1485
01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:28.771
I agree 100% and I think that that conflict is sort of what fuels thinking and

1486
01:24:30.701 --> 01:24:34.710
what few,
I think that's the Yin and Yang of life.
You,

1487
01:24:34.711 --> 01:24:39.711
you almost need conflict to try to sort of motivate you to work things out and

1488
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.290
motivate you to improve,

1489
01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:46.291
motivate you to evolve and change and to grow and to take into consideration all

1490
01:24:46.301 --> 01:24:49.120
these different facets of,
of,
of life itself.

1491
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:53.430
And I think that we all want everything to be this perfect,
you know,

1492
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.660
golden age of,
of you know,

1493
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.780
love and sharing and compassion.

1494
01:24:58.781 --> 01:25:01.690
But in order to really truly appreciate that,

1495
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:04.720
you kind of have to have some shit around to,

1496
01:25:04.721 --> 01:25:07.930
to compare it to some just like people that grow up rich,

1497
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:12.100
they'll never understand how beautiful it is to have enough money to not worry

1498
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:14.710
about money,
but so true.
Yeah.

1499
01:25:14.711 --> 01:25:19.040
It's like if you grow up in a family where you,

1500
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.140
everyone's being driven around in limousines and there's money everywhere and

1501
01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:27.640
you have servants and it's got to be incredibly difficult to understand the true

1502
01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:30.480
struggle.
Whereas if you grow up like you are like,
I don't know,

1503
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.370
you know what your childhood was like,
but my childhood,
very poor.

1504
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.710
I appreciate every dollar I have.

1505
01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:39.580
I appreciate the freedom that it gives me in that I don't have to worry about

1506
01:25:39.581 --> 01:25:43.960
money because that weight of constantly worrying about your bills is one of the

1507
01:25:43.961 --> 01:25:47.320
worst things that people have.
I cut a lot of people,

1508
01:25:47.321 --> 01:25:52.321
a lot of slack that do fucked up things for money that are broke because I

1509
01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:56.450
remember what it was like to feel that weight.
Like,
God,

1510
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.910
I don't know how I'm gonna pay my bills this month.

1511
01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.580
I don't know what's next month's going to be.
What if I get sick?

1512
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:02.770
I don't have health insurance.
I kind of foreign health insurance.

1513
01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:06.620
What if this happens?
What if that happens?
How do I take care of that?

1514
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.760
How am I ever going to stop?
Where's my glow?
Golden years is going to come from,

1515
01:26:10.761 --> 01:26:13.490
where's the retirement?
There's no fucking retirement for a lot of people.

1516
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.580
It's a joke.
This idea that you're going to get to one point,

1517
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:19.640
we're going to settle down and everything's going to be great.
You know,

1518
01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:23.420
work hard to the end of the day and the end of the day it's Miller time and they

1519
01:26:23.421 --> 01:26:27.050
look at life like there's a Miller time for life.
There's no fucking Miller time,

1520
01:26:27.051 --> 01:26:28.310
man.
It's not happening.

1521
01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.950
You're going to get to a certain point and then you're going to go now what?

1522
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:32.090
And then your heart's going to stop.

1523
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:37.370
<v 2>Yeah.
Uh,
so is a million things to say about it,</v>

1524
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:40.490
but first you should,
you should coin that.
There is no fucking Miller time.

1525
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:45.110
No Miller time for life.
Um,

1526
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.040
I remember when I was a struggling talk show host on the radio and I remember

1527
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:54.800
looking at a Snapple for like five straight minutes,

1528
01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:58.280
but I mean like literally five minutes and it was a dollar.
And I'm like,

1529
01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.730
I could just have water with my breakfast.
I don't need that Snapple.
But God,

1530
01:27:01.731 --> 01:27:03.800
I really want that Snapple.
And I,

1531
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:08.890
and I always remember that like a dollar meant extra enjoyment that day for me

1532
01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:15.830
and I,
so I value it.
But,
so that leads to a ironic conclusion.

1533
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:19.820
I actually feel bad for people who grew up rich like this.

1534
01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:24.800
Kind of a funny thing to say.
Um,
like Russell Simmons is always talking about,

1535
01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:28.670
oh,
you should meditate and don't worry about money.
I'm like,
yeah,
Russell,

1536
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:32.210
but you got $300 million.
Right?
It's easy to say,

1537
01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:35.420
don't worry about money when you have $300 million.
Right?
Yeah.

1538
01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.780
It's harder for a person who trying to pay the rent and figuring out where

1539
01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:43.400
they're going to get food for their kids and stuff like that,
and I know that,

1540
01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:48.401
I know that feeling of like being super stressed out about not having money and

1541
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:52.340
the effects of that,
but when you get a little bit,

1542
01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.570
it feels a thousand times better because if you grew up rich,

1543
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:00.890
you just,
you,
it's not your fault.
You just take it for granted.

1544
01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.490
There's because you never had any other contexts like you don't know.

1545
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:09.440
You have no idea how phenomenal it is to fly first class or business class or to

1546
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:13.040
get driven around in limos.
You like,
you take it as well,
that's normal.

1547
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:16.640
So you can only go down if you lose that stuff.
Oh,
then you're like,

1548
01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:21.590
oh my God,
my world has exploded.
How can anyone live like this?

1549
01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:26.750
Right?
But you,
it's hard to go up and it's hard to have that context.
So look,

1550
01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:29.510
I think I'm the lucky sky a lot because I grew up middle class,

1551
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:34.190
so I had enough that I can get an education and I didn't have to,

1552
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:38.840
you know,
sell drugs.
I didn't have to do any crazy shit to get money.
Right.

1553
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:41.240
So my dad provided that for me,

1554
01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.160
but I grew up middle class enough that I value money and I,

1555
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.601
you know,

1556
01:28:47.601 --> 01:28:51.410
and it means the world's like anybody who says that money is an important,

1557
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:53.540
doesn't know what they're talking about,

1558
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:57.360
hasn't been poor enough to understand that yes,
money's fucking important.
Bored.

1559
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:02.250
<v 1>I totally agree with you about being unfortunate.
If you grow up rich,</v>

1560
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:04.040
I really do.
I think that,
uh,

1561
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:09.110
especially if you grow up rich with ignorant parents and parents that don't sort

1562
01:29:09.301 --> 01:29:14.301
of explain to you in great detail how fortunate you are to be in the situation

1563
01:29:14.311 --> 01:29:18.630
and the importance of appreciating the struggle.

1564
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:22.260
But I have this weird relationship with money and uh,

1565
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:27.160
it's gotten weirder and weirder over the last few years where it's going to

1566
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.620
sound really crazy and it sounds crazy even to me,
but I,

1567
01:29:29.621 --> 01:29:34.320
I objectively look at humans and I look at what we're doing and I look at this

1568
01:29:34.321 --> 01:29:38.820
sort of system that we set up and we think it's just this is the way people

1569
01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:41.850
operate you,
you exchanged money for goods and this is,

1570
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:45.240
our society is based on money and it's all about trying to earn money.

1571
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.360
But I look at it and I go,
well,
that's just a creation.

1572
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:51.750
That's just a man made creation.
And what else is going on?
Well,

1573
01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:56.730
what else is going on is there's this slow but inevitable

1574
01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:03.620
sort of dissolving of the boundaries between human beings and information and

1575
01:30:04.411 --> 01:30:09.120
whether that information is the secrets about the NSA or that information is,

1576
01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.190
you know,
things that are on the internet,
emails,
photographs.

1577
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:15.800
There's the,

1578
01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:20.800
the trend is to have a ultimate access to all information for everyone and I

1579
01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:28.410
think that we're going to come to a bottleneck and the bottleneck is going to be

1580
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.250
that.
What is money exactly?
Well,
at this point in time it's,

1581
01:30:32.251 --> 01:30:34.800
it's just ones and Zeros.
It's just information.

1582
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:38.520
Money now is broken down to when I'm a gold standard anymore.

1583
01:30:38.521 --> 01:30:40.590
Our monies based entirely on information.

1584
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.080
It's information in a database somewhere.
Well,

1585
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:47.520
there's going to be a point in time where we have to decide as a civilization

1586
01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:52.050
that the only way to continue to move forward with our innovation to can you

1587
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.210
continue to move forward with technology.

1588
01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:58.080
We're going to have to dissolve the boundary between human beings and the

1589
01:30:58.081 --> 01:31:01.710
information that is money.
The money's not going to be worth anything anymore.

1590
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:02.581
It's going to be a weird,

1591
01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:06.660
we're going to have to come up with some new way in order to transfer wealth or

1592
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:11.661
to determine wealth or to determine reward for effort or you know,

1593
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:15.510
whatever you're doing.
Because if,

1594
01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.290
if we're just basing it on what we're basing it on now,

1595
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:23.370
it's inevitable that it comes to this point where you're not going to be able to

1596
01:31:23.371 --> 01:31:25.950
protect your money.
You're not going to be able to,

1597
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:28.060
it's not going to be able to store it.
You're not going to build,

1598
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.930
it's not going to it.
It's not going to be anywhere.

1599
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:33.930
And if it's just ones and Zeros,
everyone's going to have access to it.

1600
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:36.810
It's getting the distribution of it is going to get very weird.

1601
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:38.520
<v 2>So I'm trying to understand that.</v>

1602
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:42.330
So is the main problem there you think if you follow that to it's natural

1603
01:31:42.331 --> 01:31:44.580
conclusion that it's going to get hacked?

1604
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:48.210
<v 1>No,
I don't even think it's going to be,
I think we're calling it hacked now,</v>

1605
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:53.280
but I think the trend seems to be too,
no secrets,
no secrets.

1606
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:54.660
Complete transparency.

1607
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:59.990
I think the ultimate hive mind state you that is talked about in sort of eastern

1608
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:02.920
mysticism that we are all one.

1609
01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.950
I think we are all one and I think we're going to achieve that through

1610
01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:10.120
technology and I think that's something that no one saw coming.
I think that the,

1611
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:13.270
the hive mind is going to come through something that the,

1612
01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:17.800
this cellular mine events and then there's going to be some sort of a connection

1613
01:32:17.801 --> 01:32:22.480
between all the people all the time and we experienced it that we're

1614
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:27.481
experiencing that now by being able to access the database of human knowledge on

1615
01:32:27.761 --> 01:32:31.270
your cell phone to be able to ask Siri what the answer to a question is.

1616
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:34.480
You know,
use as Google and boom,
you get answers.

1617
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:38.860
I mean that's unprecedented in human history,
but that to me is just like,

1618
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.980
that's like one of those old school he photographs so they have to throw the

1619
01:32:41.981 --> 01:32:44.920
cape over and everybody stands still for a minute and poof.

1620
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:48.970
They press that button and the thing flashes and everybody has to stand still

1621
01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:51.280
and then you get this weird black and white image,

1622
01:32:51.281 --> 01:32:55.330
which was magic in 1850 or whenever the fuck the camera was invented.

1623
01:32:56.050 --> 01:33:01.050
I think that that's this step that you've gotten to now where I have thousands

1624
01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:06.550
of photos on my phone,
thousands and I take them instantly.

1625
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.100
I could press a button and goes,
come on,

1626
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:11.500
and they'll take a a series of pictures in a row.
That's,

1627
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.550
that's madness in comparison.
That big stupid Cape.
Well,

1628
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:20.260
I think that the access to information that we enjoy today by being able to

1629
01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:24.520
Google search something but need being able to go to your phone and find the

1630
01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:27.310
information,
it's going to get closer than that.

1631
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:30.640
It's going to be something where it's a chip that you put in your,
in your,

1632
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.880
in your body and it interfaces with your mind.
It's going to be,

1633
01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:36.820
there's going to be something,
whether it's nanotechnology,
whatever it is,

1634
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:38.170
they're going to continue to innovate.

1635
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:40.510
They're going to continue to expand on technology.

1636
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:45.750
And the trend is that there is no boundary at one point,

1637
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:47.440
at the zero point,

1638
01:33:47.441 --> 01:33:51.820
there's going to be no boundary between human beings and information and money's

1639
01:33:51.821 --> 01:33:53.920
just information.
It's all it is.

1640
01:33:53.921 --> 01:33:56.830
It's an information on a database somewhere and you're going to,

1641
01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:58.200
there's going to be a bottleneck.
Well,
we,

1642
01:33:58.230 --> 01:34:01.870
we have to decide how we manage that database,

1643
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:05.500
how we manage the access to that information.
Because if,

1644
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.740
if the ultimate trend of this technology is to erode all these boundaries and

1645
01:34:11.071 --> 01:34:14.620
to,
to have us all communicating in sync,

1646
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:17.380
you're not going to be able to have anything restricted.

1647
01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:21.790
You're not going to have anything that is outside of the access of everyone.

1648
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.380
And money is that thing.

1649
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:27.220
So we're going to come to a point in time where we're going to have to evolve as

1650
01:34:27.221 --> 01:34:29.500
a culture,
as a race,
as a species.

1651
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:33.040
And part of that evolution is to restructure ideas of wealth,

1652
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.910
restructure our ideals of the distribution of wealth.

1653
01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:40.690
What it means to have wealth.
This might,
well,
we're in talking about now,

1654
01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:42.430
I grew up poor,
you know,

1655
01:34:42.431 --> 01:34:46.060
you grew up middle class and then now I appreciate money and you appreciate

1656
01:34:46.061 --> 01:34:46.540
money.

1657
01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.650
That ain't going to even be an issue a thousand years from now because it will

1658
01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:55.390
have been dissolved by technology,
first of all.

1659
01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:58.160
Fascinating.
And,
uh,
and

1660
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:01.340
<v 2>I like,
I like your vision of like,</v>

1661
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:05.810
I dunno if you're kneel there in melting the matrix,
Jay.
But,

1662
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:08.240
um,
it,
it's,
um,

1663
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.440
so money is a,
is a tool,
right?
And so in your ultimate vision,

1664
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:18.890
I don't know how that tool is then applied.
So in our current society,

1665
01:35:18.891 --> 01:35:21.620
we make this huge mistake of thinking that it's the end,

1666
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:25.640
but it's not the end goal.
It's only a tool.
If you think it's end goal,

1667
01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.470
you're gonna make yourself miserable,
right?

1668
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.060
Cause then there's never enough of it.

1669
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:32.120
And the point of the money was to make you're happy.

1670
01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:35.540
But if you've replaced happiness with the end goal of money,

1671
01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.730
there's no winning that fight.
Right?

1672
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:41.390
So it would be really interesting to see how

1673
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:47.390
that paradigm would be in your transit,
dental world.
So,
and,

1674
01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:52.440
and there's this great fascinating circle there because everybody being one is

1675
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:57.290
something that I largely believe in as well.
Um,

1676
01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:02.710
and it's what almost everybody that thinks it through once they get past

1677
01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:06.860
religion gets too.
So whether it's the Taoists you know,

1678
01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:09.560
that you're referring to in eastern philosophy,

1679
01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:13.160
it's a transcendentalist here in the u s the Ralph Waldo Emerson,

1680
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:18.110
Henry David Thoreau's.
Um,
it's the Sioux fees in a,

1681
01:36:18.130 --> 01:36:22.250
in Muslim tradition,
they all come to the same conclusion.
We're all one,

1682
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.110
it's not necessarily a god above us.

1683
01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:26.750
It's that we're all United in some way that's,

1684
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:30.560
we can't tell them the physical space that we're in.
Right.

1685
01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.230
And the physical space that we're in,
we all seem divided.

1686
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:37.400
Like you're right there and I'm right here.
But if you break it down,
you know,

1687
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.900
on a cellular level,

1688
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:44.050
you realize that that's actually not necessarily the case because everything is

1689
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.270
not stable.
It,
it revolves.

1690
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:52.300
And so the difference between the air and my hand is not nearly as distinct as

1691
01:36:52.461 --> 01:36:56.900
we think it is.
Right?
But what would be interesting is if the oldest,
you know,

1692
01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:57.801
philosophy,

1693
01:36:57.801 --> 01:37:02.540
we have the Dallas philosophy of everyone being one and United at some point met

1694
01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:07.541
with the future where everything is United in it's Zeros and ones and zeroes,

1695
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:13.930
non-existence and one is existence.
And we are all one right in the,

1696
01:37:13.931 --> 01:37:17.450
in the vision that you have.
And I think that you might be right that we,

1697
01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.530
but that's really hard for our minds to grasp.
Like then what happens?
The money,

1698
01:37:21.531 --> 01:37:22.860
what happens to individuals,

1699
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:26.480
what happens to all those things that are so important to us now?

1700
01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.120
And how is that part of our nature now?

1701
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:33.350
But it's not necessarily part of our eternal nature.
So those answers,

1702
01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:34.184
I don't know.

1703
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:39.390
<v 1>I think that everything works to ultimately become more and more complex.</v>

1704
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:44.770
Um,
our society becomes more and more complex.

1705
01:37:44.771 --> 01:37:46.900
Our technology becomes more and more complex.

1706
01:37:46.901 --> 01:37:50.110
Our language or understanding of each other becomes more and more complex.

1707
01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:55.030
And when I look at what human beings used to be and what we are now,

1708
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:58.530
and then I just just take myself out of the situation that I've become so

1709
01:37:58.531 --> 01:37:59.580
accustomed to,
you know,

1710
01:37:59.581 --> 01:38:04.581
modern life in 2014 with the language being noises that come out of your mouth

1711
01:38:05.941 --> 01:38:10.010
and typing on a keyboard and I sort of extrapolate like,
what,

1712
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.660
where's this gonna go?
Were where is it ultimately going to go?

1713
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:17.520
That's where I came up with this idea of the money bottleneck because I really

1714
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:22.521
think that money is ultimately just that it's just information and our idea that

1715
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:27.090
we have to exchange money and the way that we do now in order to stay alive.

1716
01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.510
But that's not true because there was times and there's cultures right now where

1717
01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:32.220
they don't have money.
They have a barter system.
You know,

1718
01:38:32.221 --> 01:38:35.940
there's people that you ever watch that show life a life below zero.
Nope.

1719
01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.950
It's a show on,
um,
God,
I want to say discovery channel.
Um,
but it's a,

1720
01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:45.950
these people living in Alaska,
they all live above the arctic circle.
And um,

1721
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:49.860
a great deal of them don't use money.
They just barter,

1722
01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.900
they give each other a Caribou and this guy has a belt for your snowmobile.

1723
01:38:54.901 --> 01:38:59.790
And then they exchange like this and quite fascinating and very,

1724
01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:03.810
very friendly,
happy,
healthy people,
at least how they're portrayed on the show.

1725
01:39:03.811 --> 01:39:07.470
And it gives you this kind of,
this thought process of like,
well,
what is money?

1726
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.150
You know,
what,
what,
what is money to these,

1727
01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:11.790
these people that they don't really buy things.
They,

1728
01:39:11.791 --> 01:39:14.910
everything they get is from fishing or from hunting.

1729
01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.600
And then using that fit you like,
I'll give you this,
you give me that.

1730
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:19.570
<v 2>I am,</v>

1731
01:39:19.570 --> 01:39:22.750
but I might disagree with you on this one because to me that sounds miserable.

1732
01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:28.210
Well like I want to go grab a burger,
right?
Fried Friday.

1733
01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.130
And so,
so look in small communities that can work.

1734
01:39:33.131 --> 01:39:37.460
And of course that's the essence of monies.
Border trade.
I do this,
I do like,

1735
01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.150
I do a talk show and I get paid a certain amount of money for that.

1736
01:39:40.151 --> 01:39:44.140
And then I exchange it for burgers and rent and all that stuff.
Right?

1737
01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.850
So I think money is a good tool as long as you realize what it is.

1738
01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:51.940
It's just makes things more efficient in a larger society.

1739
01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:54.630
So I don't want to go back to living like Eskimos,

1740
01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:57.910
<v 1>nor do I.
But I think the,
when I'm looking at the complexity,</v>

1741
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I view these people that are living in this sort of a barter situation as a step

1742
01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:04.960
along the way.

1743
01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:09.490
And money simplified the entire process of exchanging goods.

1744
01:40:09.491 --> 01:40:11.050
And it simplified everything.
Well,

1745
01:40:11.051 --> 01:40:15.850
let's just agree upon coins that equal this and we'll have a bank of these

1746
01:40:15.851 --> 01:40:20.320
things.
But then somewhere along the line that bank became a fucking hard drive

1747
01:40:20.321 --> 01:40:23.620
somewhere and that gold is like,
where's Fort Knox?

1748
01:40:23.621 --> 01:40:25.990
Is it even fucking exist anymore?
What's in there?

1749
01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:31.020
It was under wt seven fucking open up a door and you see this empty room,

1750
01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:34.810
like dust on the ground.
You're like,
what the fuck?
Where's the gold?
Yeah,
I,
yeah,

1751
01:40:34.811 --> 01:40:36.070
it was under wt seven.
Right.

1752
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:40.530
<v 2>Okay.
And by the way,
I'm choking everybody calmed down.
He knows,
he knows things.</v>

1753
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.650
Okay.
I,
they think

1754
01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:46.960
<v 1>that what,
what we have established today is,</v>

1755
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:50.240
is functional.
It works.
It's great.
In a certain sense,

1756
01:40:50.241 --> 01:40:54.370
it is good to be able to use a credit card and buy a,
if you need to television,

1757
01:40:54.371 --> 01:40:56.440
you don't want to have to fucking figure out,
you know,

1758
01:40:56.441 --> 01:41:00.370
how many trees you have to chop down in order to give a guy to get a television

1759
01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:02.320
back.
It's way simpler process.

1760
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:06.850
But this is just a step along the way and this process,

1761
01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:10.750
it's not going to maintain,
it's not going to stay the way it is now.
It does.

1762
01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.521
This is not the way,

1763
01:41:11.521 --> 01:41:15.220
it wasn't the Roman days and it's not the way it was even a hundred years ago.

1764
01:41:15.221 --> 01:41:17.380
When we're on the gold standard,
it's going to change.

1765
01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.020
<v 2>So,
okay.
On that note,
uh,
I've talked to like,
I dunno,</v>

1766
01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.240
countless financial experts on the show because,
well,

1767
01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.800
there was part of the TV show or the online show.

1768
01:41:28.801 --> 01:41:31.950
I mean over the course of the last 12 years that I've been doing the young
Turks,

1769
01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:35.580
I've talked to guys who've written books about the Fed guys who were in the Fed.

1770
01:41:35.610 --> 01:41:40.290
Just everybody,
first of all,
let me just state,
no one knows what the Fed is,

1771
01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:45.180
right?
Like you get me the top financial expert on the Fed,

1772
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:49.890
I will break them down in a matter of maximum six questions.
Okay,

1773
01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:55.010
so the point where he will say,
Oh yeah,
no,
I don't really know how that,

1774
01:41:57.210 --> 01:42:02.100
like they don't like no one knows.
They know as much as I do.
They know the,
okay,

1775
01:42:02.101 --> 01:42:05.880
all right,
this is what the Fed kind of roughly does,
but where's the money?

1776
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:09.990
Who Prints it?
And then once it's printed,
why do they give it to the banks?

1777
01:42:09.991 --> 01:42:11.790
Why does it have to be given to the banks?

1778
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:16.680
Why can't it be given to the American people?
Well,
who controls the Fed?

1779
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:19.260
I mean,
look,
some of those things have simple answers,

1780
01:42:19.261 --> 01:42:23.370
but when you start going deeper down into that rabbit hole,

1781
01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:27.540
no like no one knows.
And it's really scary.
And by the way,

1782
01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:30.720
is almost in my mind,

1783
01:42:30.721 --> 01:42:34.590
it's indisputable that we will have a massive global meltdown,

1784
01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:38.580
a economic meltdown and indisputable.
Like I think,

1785
01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:42.000
I don't know if it's a year and a half from now,
I don't know.
Jesus.

1786
01:42:42.001 --> 01:42:44.130
Maybe they keep it together for 12 years,
15 years,

1787
01:42:44.131 --> 01:42:49.131
but at some point this whole thing will melt down because it's just one giant

1788
01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:53.310
pyramid scheme.
Yeah.
It's built on a foundation of unfixable bullshit.

1789
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.120
That's how I describe it.
It's just,
yeah,
there's that plus the system.
It's like,

1790
01:42:57.121 --> 01:42:57.421
you know,

1791
01:42:57.421 --> 01:42:59.670
earlier we were talking about why do we have the politicians that we do?

1792
01:42:59.671 --> 01:43:02.730
Why do we have the media will do it?
It's all based on the system that you build.

1793
01:43:02.731 --> 01:43:05.300
Why do we have the humans that we do?
It's in our DNA.
It's,

1794
01:43:05.370 --> 01:43:09.300
that's what was programmed into us and we have programmed our politics to be

1795
01:43:09.301 --> 01:43:13.920
fucked up.
Uh,
we program politics to be,
politicians need money to get elected.

1796
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:18.300
Uh,
so they will do the bidding of the people who give them money.

1797
01:43:18.930 --> 01:43:22.080
Now that's why do we build it that way?
That's ridiculous.
That's so stupid.

1798
01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.550
Then they're never going to represent you.

1799
01:43:23.551 --> 01:43:25.080
They're going to represent the people who give them the money.

1800
01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:27.600
Like we should fix the system.
That's what I want to do.

1801
01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:31.470
That's why I set up a super pac called the wolf pack to basically obliterate all

1802
01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:35.070
the other superpacs.
Right?
Because as long as there's money in politics,

1803
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.560
we're fucked it.
They will never represent us.

1804
01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:39.000
That's not how the machine is built.

1805
01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.690
The machine is built to represent the donors.
95% of the time,

1806
01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:44.490
the person with more money wins.
Right.

1807
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:48.420
Incorporations and this is what leads to the global economic meltdown.

1808
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:51.860
As soon as a corporation is born,
it's Oedipus.

1809
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:56.690
It wants to kill it's dad capitalism and fucking swamp democracy.
Okay.

1810
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:59.600
And because he doesn't want the free market,

1811
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:03.860
a corporation wants a monopoly,
it wants ultimate growth.

1812
01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:08.920
[inaudible] wants maximum expansion and wants to destroy everything in its path.

1813
01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.680
And I don't mean like in some like environmental way or they'll destroy things.

1814
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:16.010
I mean,
no,
no,
like destroy the competition so that there's no one left.

1815
01:44:16.011 --> 01:44:19.850
So they make money easier.
Right.
And okay,
I get that.

1816
01:44:19.851 --> 01:44:23.570
And I understand the need for corporations,
but you've got to write,

1817
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:26.390
rewrite one line of code there.

1818
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:30.050
You can't let public corporations,
uh,

1819
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.710
run a muck the way that we have.
Here's,
here's what I mean,

1820
01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.120
just a little bit more specific.

1821
01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.900
If you're a public corporation in you're an executive at that public
corporation,

1822
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:43.490
you have no,
you don't even care what happens to that corporation.

1823
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:47.600
All you care about is your short term benefit as long as you're an executive in

1824
01:44:47.601 --> 01:44:52.580
that corporation.
So you will do what ever it takes to make short term money,

1825
01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:54.620
including especially if you're at a bank,

1826
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:58.760
a public bank take as much risk as humanly possible,

1827
01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:02.090
cause more risk equals more short term reward.

1828
01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:05.030
That system is built to explode.

1829
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:10.160
You will eventually take so much risk that the bank will collapse.

1830
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:15.230
It happened in 2008 and they were barely able to piece it back together the next

1831
01:45:15.231 --> 01:45:19.550
time the day.
Want to do maximum risk,
maximum risk.
If you're a Gambler,

1832
01:45:19.551 --> 01:45:23.480
I'm a gambler.
If you gamble,
you know,
you take maximum risk for long enough.

1833
01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:27.680
It's a fact.
It's a certainty that you will lose all of your money.

1834
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:29.990
That's what they're going to do.
Because there's a,

1835
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:35.200
there's a wrong line of code in there where the executives of the public

1836
01:45:35.721 --> 01:45:38.090
corporations don't care about the public corporations.

1837
01:45:38.091 --> 01:45:41.900
They don't care about the American democracy and American people,
et Cetera.

1838
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:44.690
And then we let them buy our politicians.

1839
01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:51.110
<v 1>Yeah.
The representative democracy that we exist in right now too.
It's,
I don't,
I,</v>

1840
01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:51.910
I,
it's,

1841
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:55.180
I think it's a terribly flawed system and I don't think you need to represent

1842
01:45:55.181 --> 01:45:56.590
people that can speak for themselves.

1843
01:45:56.950 --> 01:46:01.060
It seems to be that what we used to need and the w the way it used to be

1844
01:46:01.061 --> 01:46:04.720
established was back when communication was incredibly difficult.
It was,

1845
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:09.520
you couldn't just vote online.
You couldn't just talk online.
You couldn't just,

1846
01:46:09.521 --> 01:46:14.200
you know,
answer questions or express your opinions on things.
But now you can.

1847
01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.820
And so to have this antiquated system representing us and then the fact that

1848
01:46:19.150 --> 01:46:24.150
this transparency that we're seeing evolve before our eyes change rapidly on a

1849
01:46:24.730 --> 01:46:28.150
day to day basis.
I mean there's new revelations that come,

1850
01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:32.110
like the NSA spying thing,
like within a year,

1851
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:36.350
the whole world attitude about email and and and,

1852
01:46:36.351 --> 01:46:41.351
and transactions and doing things online completely changed within a year.

1853
01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:46.000
Everyone assumes that everything that you put online,
whether it's a,

1854
01:46:46.001 --> 01:46:47.470
an email you send to a friend,

1855
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:50.010
whether it's a text message that you received from a lover,

1856
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.770
all those things are public.
All those things,

1857
01:46:52.771 --> 01:46:57.771
if not public now very well may be public one day and at the very least are

1858
01:46:59.041 --> 01:47:03.690
accessible by the government who may or may not use that to intimidate and or

1859
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:04.524
manipulate you.

1860
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:09.000
So we've changed the way we think and then ultimately intimidate and or

1861
01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:12.420
manipulate them because just like technology,

1862
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:16.860
when technology first enters into the human arena,

1863
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.300
it becomes a tool of the wealthy and the privileged like cell phones.

1864
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.810
It's what you go to the old rapper videos,
you see rappers with those giant,

1865
01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.280
big stupid brick cell phones.

1866
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:28.410
They were letting you know that they are wealthy and privileged.

1867
01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:30.240
That's part of the whole rap culture.

1868
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:34.500
But now you can go to South America and the jungle and you'll see someone with a

1869
01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:37.440
fucking iPhone.
I mean it,
it spreads,

1870
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.560
and I think that that technology is the spreading of that technology.

1871
01:47:42.811 --> 01:47:47.610
It just indicative of this constant ripple effect of progress,

1872
01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.770
of,
of technological progress rather,

1873
01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.190
and that this is ultimately going to happen with transparency as well.

1874
01:47:53.191 --> 01:47:57.480
What the government has the ability to do now with this NSA spying spy,

1875
01:47:57.690 --> 01:48:00.450
this gent guy's got a fucking big mouth.
He likes to tell,

1876
01:48:00.451 --> 01:48:03.210
let's find out what he's doing.
Let's get into his email,

1877
01:48:03.211 --> 01:48:06.300
see if he's got some gay porn that we could blackmail him with or something.

1878
01:48:06.301 --> 01:48:06.700
Let's,

1879
01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:07.860
<v 2>let's don't,
I definitely don't.</v>

1880
01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.340
I don't know why you would say that because I don't,

1881
01:48:12.090 --> 01:48:13.900
I don't know why that came up because I definitely don't.

1882
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:16.280
<v 1>It's just an example.
You know,
let's,
let's,</v>

1883
01:48:16.281 --> 01:48:19.880
let's dig into this guy's life and what we're going to be able to dig into their

1884
01:48:19.881 --> 01:48:23.810
lives too.
It's just right now we can't,
but we will be able to,

1885
01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.540
everyone will be able to dig in to everything everybody else has.

1886
01:48:26.630 --> 01:48:29.480
<v 2>Okay.
Now that you,
you're going down that road.</v>

1887
01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.400
I realize that and I just came upon this as you were talking,

1888
01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:36.260
cause this,
you were making a really interesting point.

1889
01:48:36.261 --> 01:48:38.780
It's not just that we can go into their lives,

1890
01:48:39.050 --> 01:48:42.920
it's like going into our lives is going to be a really valuable asset for them

1891
01:48:42.921 --> 01:48:45.100
for limited window.
Right.

1892
01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.570
Until we all realize how fucked up we all are.
Yes.

1893
01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:52.520
So they'll be able to go into it and say,
ha ha gay porn.
Ah Ha this.

1894
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.330
And then eventually we're gonna be like,
wait a minute.
Everybody's how,

1895
01:48:55.331 --> 01:48:58.820
how this or how,
how that,
yes.
So then who gives a shit?
All right.
Fuck it.

1896
01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:02.880
<v 1>Exactly.
I think that's a very important point.
And that,
you know,
uh,</v>

1897
01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:06.530
Ana Kasparian had that exact same point.
We were on the podcast,

1898
01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.370
we were sorta talking about transparency.
We're,

1899
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:10.950
we're saying that it a certain point in time we're going to,

1900
01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:13.740
everybody's got to look at everybody else's bullshit and it's not going to

1901
01:49:13.741 --> 01:49:17.770
matter anymore cause it's gonna it's gonna go away the same way.
You know,

1902
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:20.220
during the Victorian era,
they had fucking,

1903
01:49:20.221 --> 01:49:24.240
they were putting dresses over the legs of tables because they were freaked out

1904
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:27.060
that people were going to be sexually aroused by table legs.

1905
01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:28.283
<v 2>No,
I didn't know that.</v>

1906
01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.560
<v 1>Oh yeah.
That's awesome.
He's to do with piano legs.
I mean,</v>

1907
01:49:31.561 --> 01:49:32.670
they were fucking crazy.

1908
01:49:32.671 --> 01:49:36.120
They thought people were going to get sexually aroused by the legs of chairs.

1909
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:39.510
<v 2>But I mean,
on the other hand,
have you seen piano legs pretty hot?
Yeah.</v>

1910
01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.750
<v 1>It depends if you're alone and during the Victorian era,</v>

1911
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:46.390
everybody smelled pianola legs.
Probably a healthy alternative.
But I think

1912
01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.180
<v 2>stay with Muslims down.
I mean,
sure.</v>

1913
01:49:48.210 --> 01:49:50.770
<v 1>You're like,
oh my God,
if you see someone's ankle,</v>

1914
01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:54.910
well obviously you're gonna want to fuck that ankle.
I'm not sure how I it is,

1915
01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:59.560
but if you cover everybody up,
you know,
is that crazy that we live in a world,

1916
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:02.980
it's 2014 we're talking about technology and how it's going to change the world

1917
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:05.620
and,
and full transparency.

1918
01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:10.390
And we've got a significant percentage of the world walking around with curtains

1919
01:50:10.391 --> 01:50:14.220
on their head.
[inaudible] fascinating.
And not only that,
doing it on television,

1920
01:50:14.221 --> 01:50:16.980
like you watch them on television,
he could see it through,

1921
01:50:16.981 --> 01:50:21.180
transmitted through this incredible medium,
this technology,

1922
01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:26.181
the internet and video is displaying these people that are wearing these crazy

1923
01:50:26.491 --> 01:50:31.290
medieval outfits or pre medieval.
It's,
it's,
it's,

1924
01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:35.700
it's hard to imagine that in 2014 we live in a world where you have Google

1925
01:50:35.701 --> 01:50:39.720
search and women aren't allowed to drive and they're not supposed to learn.

1926
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:44.070
There's a significant population that thinks that women shouldn't read,

1927
01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.650
that they shouldn't be allowed to go to school.

1928
01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.550
<v 2>Cool.
Well look,</v>

1929
01:50:46.551 --> 01:50:49.910
anything that wants to hold onto the past is going to fight education.

1930
01:50:49.911 --> 01:50:51.980
Tooth and nail is going to fight knowledge,
tooth and nail.

1931
01:50:51.981 --> 01:50:56.600
That's why the very first chapter of the Bible is don't eat from the tree of

1932
01:50:56.601 --> 01:51:00.650
knowledge.
That is the biggest sin you could ever.
Uh,
in fact,

1933
01:51:00.651 --> 01:51:03.350
we got expelled from heaven because we ate from the tree of knowledge.

1934
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:04.670
That's what Adam and eve did.

1935
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.990
So if you've got your old way of doing things and it ain't right,

1936
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:13.040
well the first thing you want people to make sure they don't do is find out what

1937
01:51:13.041 --> 01:51:16.610
is right.
Yeah.
Right.
So they block your attempt to get knowledge,
but,

1938
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:19.710
but to your point,
Joe there,
fuck yeah.

1939
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:23.930
I mean knowledge is flooding in like a tsunami and they can't stop.

1940
01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:26.120
<v 1>You can't stop it.
There's no way to stop it.</v>

1941
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:29.340
And I think ultimately that knowledge will,

1942
01:51:29.370 --> 01:51:34.370
will transcend just simply being able to Google things and read things.

1943
01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.530
And it'll be some sort of,
and,
and scientists have speculated about this,

1944
01:51:39.531 --> 01:51:40.670
not just a knucklehead like me,

1945
01:51:40.671 --> 01:51:44.540
but the scientists have speculated that what we're going to be deal with in the

1946
01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:45.860
probably near future,

1947
01:51:45.861 --> 01:51:49.490
within the next hundred years is instant access to information directly through

1948
01:51:49.491 --> 01:51:50.870
some sort of a neural interface.

1949
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:56.180
And I believe that the exchange of tapping into something like that is that I'm

1950
01:51:56.181 --> 01:51:57.920
going to be able to get into genx mind too.

1951
01:51:58.040 --> 01:51:59.150
You're going to be able to get into mind,

1952
01:51:59.151 --> 01:52:00.400
but I'm going to be able to get into yours.

1953
01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:03.190
We're all going to be able to get into each other's minds and then that's going

1954
01:52:03.191 --> 01:52:06.350
to progress to that.
Ultimately that'll progress to some new level.

1955
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:09.380
And I think that in a sense,

1956
01:52:09.381 --> 01:52:14.381
I mean there's a lot of people that they look at the Utopian version of a,

1957
01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:19.710
a modern technologically advanced society like becoming,
you know,

1958
01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:20.301
this uh,

1959
01:52:20.301 --> 01:52:24.100
the singularity is near type thing where we're going to reach some sort of a,

1960
01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:26.300
a beautiful place because of technology.

1961
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:30.730
I think if any way that that is the way the,
the,
the,

1962
01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:33.510
the way is not going to be necessarily through artificial intelligence but

1963
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:37.250
through artificial interface of intelligence where we create something that

1964
01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:42.251
allows us to instantly access each other and we truly dive into this like

1965
01:52:44.210 --> 01:52:47.690
joining like,
like a fucking world of Warcraft server,

1966
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.840
but the world of Warcraft server,
instead of running around playing a game,

1967
01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:52.910
we're going to be thinking in each other's minds.

1968
01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:57.240
<v 2>Well,
if that day comes the first time that you go into other people's heads,</v>

1969
01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:02.550
there is going to be initial period of time,
five minutes,
five days,
five weeks,

1970
01:53:02.551 --> 01:53:06.960
whatever it is,
where you will run into darkness before you see the light.

1971
01:53:07.230 --> 01:53:10.500
Okay,
sure.
Like you're going to be like,
oh my God,

1972
01:53:10.501 --> 01:53:14.740
that dude is thinking of the most fucked up things I,
no,
no,
no.

1973
01:53:16.050 --> 01:53:18.030
He went there.
Holy Shit.
Right?

1974
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:20.700
And then you're going to move on to the next mind and you're going to think the

1975
01:53:20.701 --> 01:53:22.350
same thing and the neck,
spine,

1976
01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:26.100
and you're going to be amazed at the darkness of humanity,
right?

1977
01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.400
But then eventually you realize,
oh,
we all think that.

1978
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:31.530
But then we also think all these wonderful things,

1979
01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:35.160
and then it does like you don't necessarily mean bad by it,
right?

1980
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.050
And then you'll get to the light of knowledge that knowing that we're all the

1981
01:53:40.051 --> 01:53:44.010
same.
So that guy,
that the first guy who's thoughts you read,

1982
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:46.260
who you thought was the most fucked up guy on earth,

1983
01:53:46.530 --> 01:53:49.000
it turns out we're all just as fucked up.
Well or

1984
01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:54.110
<v 1>it will just be the first steps to the next level that gets</v>

1985
01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.120
<v 2>like the next</v>

1986
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.500
<v 1>generation of human beings that grows up with that technology.</v>

1987
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:04.980
Like I look at my kids now and I look at the Internet and I'm like,
wow,

1988
01:54:04.981 --> 01:54:08.520
what a weird world it is that these little children,

1989
01:54:08.670 --> 01:54:13.410
they're growing up with no access or no knowledge of what it was like to exist

1990
01:54:13.411 --> 01:54:15.570
in a world where there was no internet.
Well,

1991
01:54:15.571 --> 01:54:19.980
I think that the people that first experience this mind meld technology,

1992
01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:23.070
we were all read each other's minds to them and be this crazy alien concept,

1993
01:54:23.071 --> 01:54:27.120
but they're going to have to somehow or another reconcile it with the biological

1994
01:54:27.121 --> 01:54:30.600
existence that we were born into and grew up with.
And then all of a sudden,
boom,

1995
01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:34.440
connected to each other.
But the people that those people give birth to,

1996
01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:39.510
they will grow up in a world where everyone reads everyone's mind from the jump.

1997
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:42.270
And that's when things would get really fucking weird.

1998
01:54:42.271 --> 01:54:45.360
And that's when I think the money thing will become the bottleneck.

1999
01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:48.290
<v 2>So,
uh,
Joe,</v>

2000
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:51.290
you and I are at this point so old that

2001
01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:56.690
<v 1>before it happens.
Well,
sure.
They'll come up with some new shit that gets you to,</v>

2002
01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:57.421
I mean they've,

2003
01:54:57.421 --> 01:55:02.421
they've already figured out a way to use a young blood to rejuvenate mice like

2004
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:07.030
essentially of MVC that,
that article,
oh my God,
it's essentially a,

2005
01:55:07.031 --> 01:55:08.420
a vampire strategy.

2006
01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.040
They're injecting young blood into mice and they're finding that it reverses the

2007
01:55:13.041 --> 01:55:14.030
aging process.

2008
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:18.630
<v 2>Yeah.
So it looks all that's going to happen.
Like I love when America debates,</v>

2009
01:55:18.631 --> 01:55:21.570
like is this ethical and moral to do x,
Y or z?

2010
01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:25.560
Like whatever you're debating China's already in the middle of day.
Yeah.
Right.

2011
01:55:25.561 --> 01:55:29.400
Like they don't give a shit.
You know who the story Yao Ming,
yes.

2012
01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:32.200
The Chinese government took the tallest,
uh,

2013
01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:37.020
male basketball player and female basketball player and had them get married and

2014
01:55:37.110 --> 01:55:38.790
that's,
yeah.
Ming's parents.
Yeah.

2015
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.870
So like you think the Chinese aren't going to do it.
Yeah.
They created a guy.

2016
01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.033
Right.

2017
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:48.420
So there are certain DNA you're going to have to give you super strength.

2018
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.700
There's like a German baby born a couple of years ago.

2019
01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:52.830
That's like huge muscular kid

2020
01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:57.320
<v 1>myostatin inhibitors,
myostatin inhibitors,
what regulate the growth of muscles.</v>

2021
01:55:57.321 --> 01:56:00.440
And he's born without them.
So he does not have an,

2022
01:56:00.441 --> 01:56:04.790
an inhibition to keep his muscles grown within a certain certain size.

2023
01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:08.270
They existed whippets which is a dog and exists as a,

2024
01:56:08.271 --> 01:56:13.271
a genetic anomaly that just happens because of probably overbreeding and also in

2025
01:56:13.281 --> 01:56:14.840
cows occasionally in cows.

2026
01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.210
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Yeah,
we've seen it.
I've seen the cows too.
Crazy.</v>

2027
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:22.660
You think that they're not trying that in labs in China right now?
Oh yeah,

2028
01:56:22.690 --> 01:56:27.010
they are.
Okay.
So,
and you think they're not going to succeed?
They are.

2029
01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.420
They are going to succeed.
Yeah.
And then at some,

2030
01:56:29.530 --> 01:56:33.370
and then we will have the superhuman race and then we'll have us.
Yup.
Okay.

2031
01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:34.940
And then she gets really good.

2032
01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:39.030
<v 1>Yeah.
They're going to fuck us going to hold this down.
I'm going to fuck us.
This,</v>

2033
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:41.770
this China thing or this,
excuse me.
This nice thing is,

2034
01:56:41.771 --> 01:56:45.340
is quite fascinating and a,
the way to,
there's an,

2035
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:49.710
you can just Google it.
Um,
just look,
there's an article on CNN health,

2036
01:56:49.711 --> 01:56:53.090
young blood makes old mice more youthful,
but um,

2037
01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:57.720
they've essentially found out that when they take the blood of young mice,

2038
01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:01.500
it rejuvenates brain and muscle tissue in older mice,

2039
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:06.150
which is a fucking vampire strategy.
I mean it's,
it's really crazy,

2040
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:08.540
but that is what we're going,
we're going,

2041
01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:12.210
this is step one and step one is ultimately going to lead to,
you know,

2042
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:15.300
step 1000 which is going to be in mortality.

2043
01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:19.940
<v 2>So what I was saying is that we're old enough that we remember a time when there</v>

2044
01:57:19.941 --> 01:57:23.060
was no internet.
When I tried to explain that the younger people,
they just,

2045
01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:25.670
they have a hard time grasping what that means.

2046
01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:27.740
That we had to actually go to a library,

2047
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:32.420
try to look up a book that had knowledge on that topic,
read the book.

2048
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.140
They,

2049
01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:36.560
that seems like the Victorian legs that people wanted to have sex with to them.

2050
01:57:36.561 --> 01:57:41.120
I mean,
that seems like it's,
you know,
2000 years before Jesus,

2051
01:57:41.121 --> 01:57:44.750
like that's crazy to them.
That was in our lifetime.

2052
01:57:45.230 --> 01:57:50.230
And so we're naturally inclined to believe that change isn't going to happen,

2053
01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:54.770
that things are going to always be the way they are today.
Right?

2054
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:59.030
That's natural human instinct,
but that is indisputably not true.

2055
01:57:59.390 --> 01:58:03.800
So we've got a lot more change ahead of us and it's,

2056
01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:07.760
it might change things in ways that are so revolutionary.

2057
01:58:07.761 --> 01:58:09.890
It's hard to comprehend.
I think it is hard to come by

2058
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:12.650
<v 1>for hand.
I think we are the caterpillar that gives birth to the butterfly.</v>

2059
01:58:12.651 --> 01:58:15.890
We just don't realize it.
We're,
we're going to become something that we don't,

2060
01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:18.670
we don't even see coming we have right now.

2061
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:23.840
<v 2>So you're super optimistic.
You think we're going to get to be butterflies?</v>

2062
01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:26.850
<v 1>Well,
I'm optimistic,
period.
I'm a pretty optimistic person.</v>

2063
01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.590
I see negativity and I see positivity and I feel like you could dwell on the

2064
01:58:31.591 --> 01:58:32.424
negativity,

2065
01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.773
<v 2>but</v>

2066
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:37.160
<v 1>you could also dwell on the positivity.
You,
I'm aware of all the negativity.</v>

2067
01:58:37.161 --> 01:58:40.160
I'm aware of all the terrible behavior that human beings exhibited.

2068
01:58:40.161 --> 01:58:42.070
I'm aware of crime where violence,

2069
01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:46.810
but I'm also aware of beauty and I'm also aware of information being passed in a

2070
01:58:46.811 --> 01:58:51.250
way that's never been possible before.
And because of that,

2071
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.720
I talked to kids today,

2072
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:55.240
I'll talk to 20 year old kids today and they're smart as fuck.

2073
01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:58.810
And I remember how stupid I was when I was 20 and I was like,
this kid's weight.

2074
01:58:58.811 --> 01:59:00.740
I tell that to my 17 year old all the time.

2075
01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:03.640
Like you are so much smarter than I was when I was your age.

2076
01:59:03.641 --> 01:59:07.300
You you have access to so much more information.
Your,
the,

2077
01:59:07.530 --> 01:59:09.970
the conversations that you're having are so much different than the

2078
01:59:09.971 --> 01:59:13.030
conversations I was having.
This is a different world.

2079
01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:17.700
We're living it and just enjoy it.
Take,
just take action,
you know,
in,
in,
in,

2080
01:59:17.710 --> 01:59:20.220
in exploring your own interests and,

2081
01:59:20.221 --> 01:59:24.610
and following your passions and soak up as much as this information as you

2082
01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:28.540
possibly can.
Enjoy it.
Take it all in.
Don't look at it as a chore.
Like it's a,

2083
01:59:28.541 --> 01:59:30.460
it's a curiosity.
It's amazing.

2084
01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:34.570
So I don't know how anybody could look at it in a negative way.

2085
01:59:34.571 --> 01:59:36.580
I see all the negatives,
I see the pollution,

2086
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:39.270
I see the destruction of the environment.
I see all this,
the,
the,

2087
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:43.450
the potential global catastrophes left and right.
Both environmental and natural.

2088
01:59:44.050 --> 01:59:44.950
I see all that shit.

2089
01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:49.560
But I also see this crazy fucking monkey that knows how to fix things and,

2090
01:59:49.561 --> 01:59:52.840
and knows how to make videos fly through space,
you know?

2091
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:56.200
And I think that crazy monkey is going to come up with some new shit and going

2092
01:59:56.201 --> 01:59:57.034
to continue to,

2093
01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:59.500
<v 2>okay.
I 100% agree with you.
Uh,</v>

2094
01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:02.910
and it's funny because if you watch our show,

2095
02:00:02.911 --> 02:00:07.500
the news is so bad so often that it's hard not to be pessimistic and I think

2096
02:00:07.501 --> 02:00:09.930
things are actually going to get worse before they get better.
Right?

2097
02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:13.530
So we're going to have the economic meltdown,
we're going to be a dark,

2098
02:00:13.531 --> 02:00:17.040
dark caterpillar for a while before we turn into a butterfly.
But longterm,

2099
02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:21.920
I'm super optimistic.
So like if you,
one of the things that I loved,
uh,

2100
02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:26.190
I think it was BBC put together this time chart where they showed life

2101
02:00:26.191 --> 02:00:30.750
expectancy over the last 200 years and you just see it go take off,
right?

2102
02:00:31.110 --> 02:00:35.730
Like we're also the species that went from being,
you know,

2103
02:00:35.731 --> 02:00:40.731
living to the average age of 30 or whatever it was to now 70 something,

2104
02:00:40.921 --> 02:00:44.460
you know,
from tea or,
I don't remember the exact numbers,
but it's amazing.

2105
02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:49.200
And we only did it in 200 years.
Life got so much better.

2106
02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:52.500
Like sometimes they'll last question,
a time travel,
would you go forward?

2107
02:00:52.501 --> 02:00:56.880
Would you go backward?
I'm like,
you're nuts.
If you go backwards,
are you crazy?

2108
02:00:56.881 --> 02:01:00.840
Like you think,
oh my God,
Oh,
Jane Austin time.
No,
no,
no.
You're going to go,

2109
02:01:00.841 --> 02:01:05.140
they're just going to ignore her conditioning.
Okay.
You're fuck you can't based,

2110
02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:08.250
yeah.
You want to go,
you want to go to in London?
Yeah.

2111
02:01:08.251 --> 02:01:10.260
We'll take a couple of months out of your life.
Right?

2112
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:14.130
And you're lucky if you don't die on the way.
No,
don't travel backwards.
Set.

2113
02:01:14.131 --> 02:01:16.830
Terrible idea.
So things have gotten much,

2114
02:01:16.831 --> 02:01:19.860
much better as we have also deteriorated things.

2115
02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.580
And so I think there'll be a collision that is bad,

2116
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:26.610
but then we'll get into the light and I,
I'm,

2117
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:30.480
because we're ingenious little fuckers and we're going to figure it out.

2118
02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:33.650
<v 1>I agree,
but we might not be us anymore.
And that's the real problem.</v>

2119
02:01:33.651 --> 02:01:37.490
The real problem is clinging to this biological idea of what a person is.

2120
02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:41.510
I was looking at a who was being interviewed and he had been attacked by a shark

2121
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:45.290
and he had a carbon fiber arm and a carbon fiber leg and his,

2122
02:01:45.291 --> 02:01:49.970
he could articulate his fingers and his,
he was standing there with no crutches,

2123
02:01:49.971 --> 02:01:51.080
no anything with this.

2124
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:55.400
He was wearing shorts on and so from his knee down was this artificial leg and

2125
02:01:55.401 --> 02:01:58.430
it worked on an artificial hinge and he could walk around with no limp.

2126
02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.400
I mean it was amazing.
It was perfectly measured to the size of his body.

2127
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:05.450
And I'm looking at this guy and this guy's happy to have this artificial hand,

2128
02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:09.770
this artificial leg.
And I'm like,
okay,
what if it's two legs and two hands?

2129
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:14.180
What if it's a whole body?
What if you're paralyzed,
but they say,
okay,

2130
02:02:14.181 --> 02:02:15.140
you are paralyzed,

2131
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:18.740
but we can take your brain and we can put it in this artificial body and you can

2132
02:02:18.741 --> 02:02:21.530
move around.
You're like,
fuck yeah,
give me an artificial body.
Well,
you know,

2133
02:02:21.531 --> 02:02:24.290
you won't be able to have sex anymore,
but,
but,
but,
but yeah,
I understand,

2134
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.620
but I'll still be able to joy almost everything else that other people do.
Yes,

2135
02:02:27.621 --> 02:02:30.560
you will.
Boom,
you're in an artificial body.
Well,
they say,
well look,

2136
02:02:30.561 --> 02:02:33.140
we've got a problem.
Your brain is developing Alzheimer's,

2137
02:02:33.141 --> 02:02:34.370
but here's the good news.

2138
02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.120
We can take your brain and we can download all the contents of it into this

2139
02:02:38.121 --> 02:02:42.020
artificial brain and you can essentially live forever in this artificial body.

2140
02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.110
Whoa.
Now what?
With what the fuck are you?

2141
02:02:45.111 --> 02:02:49.100
Then when you become a program that's inside something that a human being

2142
02:02:49.101 --> 02:02:49.934
created,

2143
02:02:50.010 --> 02:02:52.650
<v 2>then Johnny Depp just make that move that I didn't see it.</v>

2144
02:02:52.651 --> 02:02:55.830
It looked like a piece of shit,
but two,

2145
02:02:55.831 --> 02:02:59.820
two robots that are already on their way to doing your vision to some degree.

2146
02:02:59.910 --> 02:03:04.320
Right?
I saw,
they were just demonstrating to chuck Hagle like two weeks ago.

2147
02:03:04.590 --> 02:03:07.400
Uh,
some,
uh,
Defense Department,
they,
the,

2148
02:03:07.401 --> 02:03:11.370
the apartment within the Pentagon that creates everything like the microwave,

2149
02:03:11.371 --> 02:03:15.240
all that side of the Internet.
So that department,
they've created the robots.
Uh,

2150
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:18.810
and now you can control the robots from a distance.
Okay.

2151
02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:22.620
This is what was the controller does this,
the robot does this.
Right?

2152
02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:26.400
And so they already exist.
It's just a matter of perfecting them.
Right.

2153
02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:29.520
And then whatever's in your head,
the robot does,

2154
02:03:29.970 --> 02:03:33.480
that's both incredibly scary and incredibly promising.
Right.

2155
02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.400
And then there's the robots that are the sex robots right now.
They kind of suck.

2156
02:03:38.401 --> 02:03:41.700
Right.
But eventually they'll be awesome.
Yeah.

2157
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.200
Then you can create any sex robot you like to have them look like anyone you

2158
02:03:46.201 --> 02:03:49.560
like.
Okay.
And that's a whole different world.
Right?

2159
02:03:50.070 --> 02:03:53.400
And so that stuff gets dark before it gets better.
Right.

2160
02:03:53.730 --> 02:03:56.190
Because when your wife catches you with her sisters,

2161
02:03:56.191 --> 02:03:58.380
robot is going to be trouble.

2162
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2163
02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.090
If you have a robot of your wife's sister that you keep in a box somewhere and

2164
02:04:02.091 --> 02:04:04.610
your wife's like my fucking sister,
you made a robot out of my sister.

2165
02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:09.310
<v 2>Yeah,
so that's going to happen to,</v>

2166
02:04:09.850 --> 02:04:14.850
that connects back to our initial conversation about nature and animals,

2167
02:04:15.061 --> 02:04:16.620
right?
We're trying to preserve something.

2168
02:04:16.621 --> 02:04:20.300
They cannot be preserved because nature is bigger than that you get,

2169
02:04:20.301 --> 02:04:24.330
it's more uncontrollable than that.
Right?
But that's also true of us.

2170
02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:29.690
So we are going to evolve into something that is different than what we have now

2171
02:04:30.030 --> 02:04:32.670
and that's going to trip us out because we don't like change.

2172
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:34.110
<v 1>We won't even exist anymore.</v>

2173
02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:36.810
It's not just that we will evolve into something that we don't like.

2174
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:39.610
It's we won't even be an option.
And I,

2175
02:04:39.611 --> 02:04:42.750
I really truly believe that that scenario that I took,

2176
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:46.470
that I depicted about the guy with one arm and one leg that's happy to have that

2177
02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:49.830
artificial arm and artificial leg that's going to happen with the body.

2178
02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:51.910
It's going to happen with the whole body.
They're going to have a,

2179
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:56.820
they already developed an artificial skin in a test tube that they combined with

2180
02:04:56.821 --> 02:05:00.330
spider web,
spider silk that is bulletproof.

2181
02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.010
They've used artificial skin cells or skin cells that they have somehow or

2182
02:05:05.011 --> 02:05:08.670
another to sue some scientific process that a moron like me will never be able

2183
02:05:08.671 --> 02:05:12.420
to truly describe,
but they've been able to,
at least in theory,

2184
02:05:12.421 --> 02:05:17.421
developed this bulletproof fucking skin who's not going to get bulletproof skin.

2185
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:19.860
And not only that,
what,
what is skin get?

2186
02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.800
I mean you see these poor people like there's a fucking Vegas commercial that

2187
02:05:22.801 --> 02:05:26.400
they're airing these days with Wayne Newton.
It's a,
you know,

2188
02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:32.120
getting people excited about Vegas and Wayne Newton has this rubber face man,

2189
02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:33.420
this poor fucker,

2190
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:38.870
his face is pulled back and it's shot up with Botox and fillers meets some of

2191
02:05:39.781 --> 02:05:43.530
these to tell him just be an older man.
It's way better than what you're doing,

2192
02:05:43.531 --> 02:05:46.410
what you're doing.
Yeah,
you're terrifying to look at,

2193
02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:49.680
but we're going to be able to just replace your fucking skin.

2194
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:53.490
Forget about all that,
stretching this and pulling that and injecting into that.

2195
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.990
How about we just take all that stupid shit off and just like we can give you an

2196
02:05:57.991 --> 02:06:02.490
artificial hand,
we'll give you a whole fucking,
a whole Oregon,

2197
02:06:02.491 --> 02:06:06.600
a whole skin Oregon that can't get cancer and it's fucking bulletproof.

2198
02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:09.920
<v 2>Okay?
So people think,
oh,
well that's unethical.
We're not going to do that.</v>

2199
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:14.260
What does that mean?
Right?
Except when,
again,
I keep going back to China.

2200
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:16.050
No,
nothing against the,

2201
02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:18.990
it's just they have an unscrupulous government at this point,
right?

2202
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:23.810
And my wife's Chinese,
my kids are Chinese.
Okay.
So there you go.
Okay.
So,
uh,

2203
02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:26.030
when the Chinese start making super babies,

2204
02:06:26.090 --> 02:06:29.270
would that are super strong like we talked about and they have a spider skin

2205
02:06:29.271 --> 02:06:32.480
that's bulletproof and then they start messing with the mind and the kid's

2206
02:06:32.481 --> 02:06:35.210
smarter than average kid.
Now what are you going to do?

2207
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:37.610
You're going to have your kids be dumber than those kids.

2208
02:06:37.670 --> 02:06:40.670
You're gonna make the decision.
No,
no,
no.

2209
02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:42.900
I don't want the super babies now.

2210
02:06:42.901 --> 02:06:46.670
Or then the super babies will be 1% then there'll be 10% and then there'll be

2211
02:06:46.671 --> 02:06:50.870
30% and when they're 70% you're still going to be in that percentage saying,
oh,

2212
02:06:50.871 --> 02:06:54.260
no,
no,
no.
It's okay.
I'm happy that the other kids are smarter,
stronger,

2213
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:58.370
have bulletproof skin,
but mine won't.
Maybe,

2214
02:06:59.000 --> 02:06:59.870
but maybe not.

2215
02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:04.230
<v 1>I'm the much more likely scenario will be that we will be,</v>

2216
02:07:04.290 --> 02:07:08.240
or I say we,
the people that choose to go the route of,

2217
02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:12.660
of innovation and to accept what technology is capable of,

2218
02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:17.070
the ways that it's capable of advancing the mind will treat everyone else the

2219
02:07:17.071 --> 02:07:21.270
way we treat chimps,
though they're not gonna let them dominate the earth.

2220
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:22.650
They're going to confine them to zoos.

2221
02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:25.440
They're gonna keep them locked up in certain places where they don't interfere

2222
02:07:25.441 --> 02:07:29.190
with the,
the,
the new evolved race and species of people.

2223
02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:29.731
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2224
02:07:29.731 --> 02:07:34.260
I think one of the scientists said that they're worried about if aliens find our

2225
02:07:34.261 --> 02:07:38.720
planet,
because it's incredibly,
I think that's right,
Steve Hawks,
right.
Uh,

2226
02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:42.040
incredibly likely that there are,
there's other life on other planets.

2227
02:07:42.250 --> 02:07:46.390
Statistically speaking,
it would be crazy if there wasn't.
And if they get here,

2228
02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:51.340
I mean they could easily view us as we view the ants.
I mean,

2229
02:07:51.341 --> 02:07:55.330
how much regard do we have for the,
for the wellbeing events?
We think,
well,

2230
02:07:55.331 --> 02:07:59.080
they're not that conscious who gives a shit.
Right.
And we're not that conscious.

2231
02:07:59.081 --> 02:08:00.910
We're not that,
you know,
evolved.

2232
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:05.350
And so the future us might feel the same way about us.

2233
02:08:05.490 --> 02:08:09.480
<v 1>Yeah,
unquestionably.
I mean,
look at what we allow ourselves to do.</v>

2234
02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:13.200
Two intelligent species like dolphins.
I mean,
we don't give a fuck.

2235
02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:15.660
We know the dolphins are smart,
but we don't know what they're saying.

2236
02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:18.840
So because we don't know what they're saying,
we're like,
um,
here's the fish.

2237
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:22.410
Do you want to flip?
If you flip,
I'll give you the fit.
You want to leave?
Oh No,

2238
02:08:22.411 --> 02:08:25.860
you can't leave.
You're in the tank.
This is where you live and we're,
we're happy.

2239
02:08:25.861 --> 02:08:26.161
You know,

2240
02:08:26.161 --> 02:08:29.280
taking our kids to seaworld and watch these fucking things jumped through hoops.

2241
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:34.360
<v 2>No,
we're,
we're both great.
A species,
you know,
have this,</v>

2242
02:08:34.361 --> 02:08:38.020
like you said,
we figured all this stuff out.
We figured out how to live longer.

2243
02:08:38.021 --> 02:08:40.900
We forget.
We're also vicious.

2244
02:08:40.901 --> 02:08:45.901
We're vicious species and don't give a damn about anybody else or anything else.

2245
02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:50.990
So,
um,
what happens when you amp that up?
Yeah,
well,

2246
02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:53.900
<v 1>we're realizing that we're vicious.
We're aware that we're vicious,</v>

2247
02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:58.400
but we've spent millions and millions of years developing in a world filled with

2248
02:08:58.401 --> 02:09:02.000
lions and tigers and bears.
Oh my,
I mean,
that's the world that we live in.

2249
02:09:02.001 --> 02:09:05.150
That's the reality of the world.
And that's what our DNA has developed in.

2250
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:08.000
And then all of a sudden we reached this point,
whether it's a hundred years,

2251
02:09:08.001 --> 02:09:09.950
at 300 years ago,
whatever it is,
we,
we,

2252
02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:13.730
we've reached this point where started being aware of how crazy it is,

2253
02:09:13.731 --> 02:09:16.160
our dominance over the rest of the species on this planet.

2254
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:20.660
But it's a fairly recent thing.
I mean,
we talked about on the podcast many times,

2255
02:09:20.661 --> 02:09:24.980
I have this thing about wolves kind of obsessed with wolves and also obsessed

2256
02:09:24.981 --> 02:09:28.820
with this romanticized vision of wolves that most people have.

2257
02:09:29.090 --> 02:09:32.440
And the reason why this Little Red Riding Hood,
you know,

2258
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:36.230
the reason why I was the big bad wolf wolves used to fucking eat people on a

2259
02:09:36.231 --> 02:09:40.380
regular basis.
And in Paris in the 14 hundreds there was a,

2260
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:45.470
an instance where wolves had killed 40 people in Paris.

2261
02:09:45.710 --> 02:09:46.151
So the,

2262
02:09:46.151 --> 02:09:51.151
the people that lived in Paris had to band together to fight this pack of wolves

2263
02:09:51.411 --> 02:09:55.070
that hadn't invaded Paris during World War One,

2264
02:09:55.190 --> 02:10:00.190
the Russians and the Germans made a truce so that they could kill wolves because

2265
02:10:00.801 --> 02:10:01.880
they were in Russia.

2266
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.320
And when Germany and the German troops and the Russian troops would go on

2267
02:10:06.321 --> 02:10:08.510
patrol,
they would get killed by wolves.

2268
02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:12.050
They ran into a super PAC and the super pack of wolves was like a hundred plus

2269
02:10:12.051 --> 02:10:12.740
wolves.

2270
02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:16.130
And they would find these people that were on patrol and they would kill them.

2271
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.671
So they,

2272
02:10:16.671 --> 02:10:20.630
these Russian soldiers and German soldiers would come upon these bodies that

2273
02:10:20.631 --> 02:10:21.441
were ripped apart.

2274
02:10:21.441 --> 02:10:25.740
They would find like shoes and like some tattered clothes and the fucking
femurs,

2275
02:10:25.741 --> 02:10:27.920
it'd be snapped in half.
They'd suck the marrow out.

2276
02:10:27.921 --> 02:10:29.780
Like they had a real God damn problem.

2277
02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:33.170
So they had to make a truce to kill these fucking wolves.

2278
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:35.120
They had to make a trip.
This is the world.

2279
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:37.130
This is the real world that we live in.

2280
02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:40.610
This is that it's not a world where the wolves rescue the baby and bring it back

2281
02:10:40.611 --> 02:10:43.880
to the doorstep and wink at the family and then run off into the woods to be

2282
02:10:43.881 --> 02:10:47.210
with nature and Chirp around with butterflies and chipmunks.
No,

2283
02:10:47.211 --> 02:10:51.590
it's a fucking vicious,
horrible world of predators and prey.

2284
02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.840
And that's the world that we developed in.

2285
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:56.420
And so we still have these cruel instincts because of that.

2286
02:10:56.421 --> 02:10:58.010
And we still have this,
this,

2287
02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.160
this ability to sort of block off our ideas that we apply to humans that we love

2288
02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:08.960
and in sort of alienate humans that we don't love,
decide that this is the enemy,

2289
02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:13.610
make these separations with,
with humans.
So of course we do it with animals.

2290
02:11:13.611 --> 02:11:15.620
Of course we deal with dolphins.
Of course,

2291
02:11:15.621 --> 02:11:17.330
we do it with almost everything we get a chance to

2292
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:22.290
<v 2>do.
So I've now even happier than I named my Superpac Wolf Pack.</v>

2293
02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:25.200
That's great wolves,
a mother fuckers man,

2294
02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:29.690
<v 1>smartest of all the predators because of the only ones of the super predators</v>

2295
02:11:29.691 --> 02:11:30.524
that act as a group.

2296
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.610
<v 2>That's exactly why we called a wolf man.
Good.
Good name.</v>

2297
02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:38.210
So like everybody tells us impossible to get a constitutional amendment to get

2298
02:11:38.211 --> 02:11:40.250
money out of politics and all that stuff.
Oh,

2299
02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:43.790
except that every generation of Americans has gotten an amendment except us.

2300
02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:45.680
Right?
So it's not impossible.
Right?

2301
02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.740
Women got the right to vote when they couldn't vote in the first place.

2302
02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:53.510
That was impossible.
[inaudible] right.
This is doable.
But when people ask me,

2303
02:11:53.511 --> 02:11:56.870
they're like,
dude packs her name,
like fluffy things,
like a better tomorrow,

2304
02:11:56.871 --> 02:12:00.650
tomorrow,
stuff like that.
Americans for America,
you know that whole thing.

2305
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:03.140
What the fuck you named it?
Wolf Pac man.

2306
02:12:03.141 --> 02:12:07.370
Nobody like rich people are going to get discombobulated by that.

2307
02:12:07.371 --> 02:12:10.100
And I don't want to give money to something called Wolf Pack.

2308
02:12:10.101 --> 02:12:13.630
That sounds fucking dangerous,
right?
I'm like,
exactly.

2309
02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:16.610
We're not trying to get money from rich people.

2310
02:12:16.730 --> 02:12:21.730
We're trying to form a pack of a group that works together and that is super

2311
02:12:22.731 --> 02:12:26.090
aggressive and that is not gonna stop until we get this amendment.

2312
02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:27.680
And if you stand in our way,

2313
02:12:27.681 --> 02:12:30.920
we are going to chew you up and we're going to drink your femur.

2314
02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:38.150
So sad day for you and look and people get the message man,

2315
02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:41.660
the whether you like it or not,
we're coming,
we're in the woods and we're coming.

2316
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:42.470
Well,

2317
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:47.470
<v 1>much like the Internet has given people the ability to access information and in</v>

2318
02:12:47.631 --> 02:12:49.550
a way that was never possible before.

2319
02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.860
I think that the Internet is also going to give people the ability to express

2320
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:57.470
influence in a way that's never been available before.

2321
02:12:57.710 --> 02:13:02.710
And a group of 300 million people mean when you say the 1% that they have,

2322
02:13:04.311 --> 02:13:08.930
you know,
more money than you know,
x amount of people put together and you know,

2323
02:13:08.931 --> 02:13:11.300
you can buy,
you take them the wealthy,

2324
02:13:11.301 --> 02:13:13.910
1% in this country and you combine their wealth.

2325
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:16.550
But how many people that that's all well and good,

2326
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:18.650
but they compete against each other.

2327
02:13:19.130 --> 02:13:23.750
And if you can get 300 million people in this country to recognize what a

2328
02:13:23.751 --> 02:13:28.010
fucking shell game it really truly is,
and then say,
look,

2329
02:13:28.011 --> 02:13:30.020
there's only one way to stop the shell game.

2330
02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:34.890
You've got to remove money from politics and you have to have politicians that

2331
02:13:34.891 --> 02:13:38.730
act for the people,
which is what did it initially,

2332
02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:41.760
the whole idea of a representative government was supposed to be about.

2333
02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.470
It was supposed to be about having people that represent the rest of us so that

2334
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:47.760
everything remains fair,

2335
02:13:47.761 --> 02:13:52.110
that we're allowed to prosper without being pulled down by the weight of an

2336
02:13:52.111 --> 02:13:54.450
oppressive government like we were in Europe.

2337
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:57.300
So whole reason why people came to America in the first place.

2338
02:13:58.210 --> 02:14:01.900
<v 2>What's amazing is that in our efforts to reclaim democracy,</v>

2339
02:14:01.901 --> 02:14:03.910
because it just doesn't exist on national level anymore.

2340
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:08.030
Just one quick thing about that.
Princeton just did a research study.
Uh,

2341
02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:13.290
they went back to like I think 1981 and studied 1800 policy positions and they

2342
02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:17.260
looked at public opinion and elite opinion and lobbyists opinion.

2343
02:14:17.530 --> 02:14:20.020
Public opinion had no effect,

2344
02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:23.980
no effect on what our so-called representatives did at the national level.

2345
02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:28.780
It did not affect policy at all.
Elite opinion,
lobbyists,
donor opinion,

2346
02:14:29.230 --> 02:14:30.320
complete correlation.

2347
02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:35.650
What they wanted is exactly the policy that uh,
we got.
Okay.

2348
02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:40.000
So we lost the democracy at the national level and people are super discouraged

2349
02:14:40.001 --> 02:14:40.600
by that.

2350
02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:44.740
But what's interesting is that we have learned that it actually still exists at

2351
02:14:44.741 --> 02:14:48.520
the state level.
And so we'll go into Maine and in Maine,

2352
02:14:48.610 --> 02:14:52.840
one of the state reps,
it runs the cash register at her local grocery store.

2353
02:14:53.410 --> 02:14:55.000
She doesn't own the grocery store.

2354
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:58.900
She's the cashier just sorta later it took her 250 bucks a winter seat.
Okay.

2355
02:14:59.330 --> 02:15:01.630
And so,
and they have public financing in Maine,

2356
02:15:01.631 --> 02:15:06.400
so she got the 250 from that public financing thing.
And you know what she does?

2357
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:09.370
She gives a shit about the people in her district.

2358
02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.030
She represents them cause she sees them everyday at the cash register when

2359
02:15:13.031 --> 02:15:15.490
they're taking their cucumbers and their orange juice and stuff.

2360
02:15:15.730 --> 02:15:18.070
And so she doesn't want the kids poison in that area.

2361
02:15:18.071 --> 02:15:19.450
So she's just stopped to pollution.

2362
02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:22.750
She also doesn't want business to leave because business hires her,
right?

2363
02:15:22.930 --> 02:15:27.610
So she represents the people.
And when you find democracy,
it's like,

2364
02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:32.290
wow,
that's mind bending.
That's amazing.

2365
02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:33.790
She represents us.

2366
02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:39.040
And so it's a beautiful thing we're trying to rebuild.
Right?

2367
02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:41.080
And it actually existed here,
right.

2368
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:44.620
And it seems like now we never had democracy here.
Oh,

2369
02:15:44.621 --> 02:15:47.350
the coups that we did and all the terrible things we did,
Yada Yada.

2370
02:15:47.351 --> 02:15:48.610
But on the domestic level,

2371
02:15:48.970 --> 02:15:53.970
Ralph Nader got Richard Nixon to set up the environmental protection agency.

2372
02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:57.850
Isn't that amazing?
Like right now,

2373
02:15:57.851 --> 02:16:01.150
Ralph Nader couldn't get Ralph Nader to put on his shoes.
Right?

2374
02:16:01.151 --> 02:16:04.570
Like he can't eat.
He's no way.
That seems like crazy.

2375
02:16:04.571 --> 02:16:07.300
And Richard Nixon was a bad ass mother fucker.
Right?

2376
02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.120
And he was like as right wing as it gets.
And he was like,
Oh my God,

2377
02:16:10.121 --> 02:16:13.720
I'm so sorry Ralph.
I'm so cal.
Do,
oh,
shall do.
EPA.
I'll do seat belts.

2378
02:16:13.721 --> 02:16:14.680
What do you need me to do?

2379
02:16:15.070 --> 02:16:20.070
That's how strong a populous movement was when we weren't swamped with money in

2380
02:16:20.231 --> 02:16:22.450
politics.
And we can get back to that.

2381
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:25.960
We didn't have a major banking collapse for 50 years.

2382
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:30.640
Isn't that amazing?
For 50 years,
didn't have a major bank close.
Why?

2383
02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:32.200
Because we actually had a democracy.

2384
02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:38.100
It all changed in 1976 and 1978 it was before Reagan and 76 supreme court said

2385
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:43.270
in Buckley,
Valeo,
money is speech.
In 1978 in Bellatti,
they said,

2386
02:16:43.510 --> 02:16:47.860
corporations are human beings and hence have first amendment right to spend

2387
02:16:47.861 --> 02:16:52.510
money in politics.
Downhill from that moment on,
it was over.

2388
02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:54.250
And I talked to Nader and I said,
look,

2389
02:16:54.610 --> 02:16:57.580
Raiders Nader's or run a rough shot through the country,
right?

2390
02:16:57.610 --> 02:17:02.610
You're the original wolf pack and you're bending Nixon to your will and then you

2391
02:17:02.651 --> 02:17:06.700
run into a brick wall.
He said,
well,
I said,
what happened?
He said,
it was 1978.

2392
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:11.470
Funny enough,
same year,
right?
And Tony Coy,
Aao,
uh,
is what happened.
I said,

2393
02:17:11.471 --> 02:17:15.400
who the fuck's Tony Coy?
I didn't know him at the time.
He said,
he's a democratic,

2394
02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:20.020
uh,
representative.
He's in the house who went to the Democratic Party and said,

2395
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.640
oh,
because of these new Supreme Court decisions,
we can take corporate money too.

2396
02:17:25.450 --> 02:17:26.590
So fuck it.

2397
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:30.460
We can't compete with the Republicans because they're just taking corporate

2398
02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:33.160
money.
Let's take corporate money too.
He said from then on,

2399
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:35.830
we never had any progress.
Wow.

2400
02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:38.350
It's incredible that that doesn't get recognized.

2401
02:17:38.351 --> 02:17:40.120
Like the supreme courts recent decision,

2402
02:17:40.530 --> 02:17:44.830
the explain that decision for folks who don't understand what happened and how

2403
02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:49.150
devastating it is.
So there's two recent decision citizens United and MCCUTCHEON,

2404
02:17:49.151 --> 02:17:53.330
right?
So citizens United is universally recognized as the thing that,
you know,

2405
02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:56.410
killed our democracy,
but it isn't.
It actually shot a dead horse.

2406
02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:00.940
It took this system that was already super fucked and just put it up on
steroids.

2407
02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:05.080
So once corporations could spend money in politics,
we were fucked.

2408
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:09.370
And that's when the Princeton study starts as in 1981 and from then on,

2409
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:14.470
even back then,
we had no effect when in fact we,
in the previous 50 years,

2410
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:19.240
we were correlated.
Our positions did matter.
Our government did represent us,

2411
02:18:19.241 --> 02:18:24.070
right?
So,
and then citizens United,
they just lifted all caps and they said,
oh,

2412
02:18:24.071 --> 02:18:28.150
if it's an independent expenditure,
like Joe Rogan is running for Congress,

2413
02:18:28.151 --> 02:18:31.510
I'm not given to Joe Rogan.
I'm giving to the Joe Rogan pack.
Okay.

2414
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:36.870
Or Friends of Joe Rogan pack and the naked spent a gazillion dollars supporting

2415
02:18:37.271 --> 02:18:41.080
you guy just in,
I think it's in Montana,

2416
02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:45.400
set up a PAC raise all this money left the pack,

2417
02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:48.490
started running for Congress and that pack then just gave them all the month.

2418
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:50.740
I mean,
it's a joke,
it's a fucking joke,
right?

2419
02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:55.210
It's just a way of giving you the money through one thin layer of legal
loophole.

2420
02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:58.120
And then in McCutchen they said,
yeah,
you know,

2421
02:18:58.121 --> 02:19:01.120
at least then you couldn't give unlimited money to the parties and there were

2422
02:19:01.121 --> 02:19:04.150
still some rules.
I fucked those rules.
Okay.

2423
02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:09.390
Now the old limit was $123,000 that you could give in any one cycle,

2424
02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:13.900
right?
Not through the,
the super pacs,
but to individual campaigns.

2425
02:19:14.390 --> 02:19:17.320
They're like 123,000 is too little.

2426
02:19:18.370 --> 02:19:21.730
So now you can give unlimited money to the political parties.

2427
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:25.390
And so there's no limits.
You can do an independent expenditure.

2428
02:19:25.391 --> 02:19:28.640
You can do a super pack,
you can give to the,
uh,
politicians.

2429
02:19:28.641 --> 02:19:31.940
This tiny little things left,
but they're just a joke.

2430
02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:36.590
There are veneer left there to pretend that there are limits when in fact it's

2431
02:19:36.591 --> 02:19:39.440
limitless auction.
We don't have a democracy anymore.

2432
02:19:39.441 --> 02:19:41.330
We have an open auction for our politicians.

2433
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:44.660
It's so credible that they're not accountable for that decision because that

2434
02:19:44.661 --> 02:19:47.600
seems like such a fucking crazy thing to decide.

2435
02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:50.210
It seems like such a damaging,

2436
02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:54.680
devastating blow to what this country was supposed to be in the first place.

2437
02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:59.510
I mean,
it's,
it's amazing.
I wonder how they justify that.
Look,

2438
02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:02.840
nobody ever wakes up in the morning.
I interviewed Larry King recently.

2439
02:20:02.841 --> 02:20:06.260
I went on his show him before that he came on my show and I,
he says something,

2440
02:20:06.261 --> 02:20:08.550
I totally agree with it.
Nobody ever wakes up in the morning,

2441
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:11.960
thinks that they're evil.
They think they're like the greatest person ever.
Like,

2442
02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:13.100
like he said,
you know,

2443
02:20:13.101 --> 02:20:16.760
Hitler got up and he combed his hair and was thinking like,
you're looking good,

2444
02:20:16.761 --> 02:20:17.810
doing good.
Right?

2445
02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:24.940
And so these guys have convinced themselves through a series of reading papers

2446
02:20:25.281 --> 02:20:28.910
from American Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation.
These think tanks,

2447
02:20:28.911 --> 02:20:31.160
venerable think tanks that they're doing the right thing.

2448
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:36.290
Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy say that giving unlimited money like this

2449
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:41.590
doesn't even lead to the appearance of corruption on what fucking planet.

2450
02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:44.270
I mean literally there was a recent poll,

2451
02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:48.530
96% of Americans thinks that there's too much money,

2452
02:20:48.531 --> 02:20:52.700
has too much influence in politics there in the supreme courts in the 4% who

2453
02:20:52.701 --> 02:20:57.290
thinks,
nope,
nope,
no,
I don't see it so credible.
It's incredible.
It's like,

2454
02:20:58.410 --> 02:20:58.990
wow,

2455
02:20:58.990 --> 02:21:03.620
that's just an amazing thing to say that they don't think that it creates

2456
02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:06.020
corruption.
It's a,
it's a really an amazing thing to say.

2457
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:09.710
What do you think is going on behind the scenes?
I mean,
do they,

2458
02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:14.420
does someone sit down the way,
the MSNBC exact sit down with you?
I mean,

2459
02:21:14.421 --> 02:21:18.500
is that really the same kind of a conversation?
No,
look,
I think obviously the,

2460
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:20.600
those conversations happened from time to time,

2461
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:22.730
but usually it doesn't have to get to that conversation.

2462
02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.240
I think that the system creates the things that it wants.

2463
02:21:26.241 --> 02:21:31.241
So for in 1971 guy named Lewis Powell writes a memo to the Chamber of Commerce

2464
02:21:31.681 --> 02:21:32.870
and it says,
Hey,

2465
02:21:32.930 --> 02:21:37.580
corporations should basically go in and affect every part of our society.

2466
02:21:37.581 --> 02:21:41.060
We should spend a lot of money effecting education,
affecting politics,

2467
02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:45.860
and effecting the supreme court.
Okay.
And Richard Nixon reads that,

2468
02:21:45.861 --> 02:21:48.790
and as he's getting his ass handed to them by Ralph Nader says,

2469
02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:52.370
maybe there's a good longterm way of fighting back.
It takes Lewis Powell,

2470
02:21:52.371 --> 02:21:56.330
who wrote that memo on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and puts them on the

2471
02:21:56.330 --> 02:22:00.620
Supreme Court.
And then Powell is the one who has the deciding vote in Buckley,

2472
02:22:00.621 --> 02:22:05.150
Viva la on Bellatti that then spins us off into this nightmare that we're in
now.

2473
02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.470
So it was simply Nixon getting money from businessmen.

2474
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:12.680
Businessmen wanted Lewis Powell who figured out how to,

2475
02:22:13.430 --> 02:22:17.270
for businessmen to take over the country.
They wanted him on the supreme court.

2476
02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:20.510
Nixon does them that favor because that's where he gets his money.

2477
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:25.010
It's just a self perpetuating system where like Barack Obama,

2478
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:28.500
he thinks he's like a lovely guy,
right?
He thinks he brought us change and he's,

2479
02:22:28.501 --> 02:22:32.070
you know,
oh I got you.
5% change.
You still busting my ass over this.

2480
02:22:32.071 --> 02:22:35.190
What the fuck?
Right?
But in reality,

2481
02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:39.360
what he doesn't know is that he loves the system.
He,

2482
02:22:39.361 --> 02:22:41.610
this system made him president of the United States of America,

2483
02:22:41.611 --> 02:22:44.640
the most powerful man on earth.
He,
if he was a wrestler,

2484
02:22:44.641 --> 02:22:46.740
his nickname would be the establishment,
right?

2485
02:22:47.130 --> 02:22:50.430
So Obama does what is natural to them.
What is,

2486
02:22:50.431 --> 02:22:54.030
how has he gotten successful this whole time?
Take corporate donations,

2487
02:22:54.031 --> 02:22:57.420
take donations from Goldman Sachs and give a veneer of change.

2488
02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:01.410
So people are placated and they keep the system going exactly as it is.

2489
02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:04.800
He thinks that's the right thing to do.
You know?

2490
02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:10.040
So Justice Roberts worked for corporations for before he was a judge,

2491
02:23:10.181 --> 02:23:13.710
had set up all these people that grew up in an atmosphere and in a context,

2492
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:15.330
just like we were talking about with rich people,

2493
02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:18.570
it's the context you grew up in.
They always had money.
They didn't know.

2494
02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:22.920
These guys always grew up in a,
in a world where corporations were always right,

2495
02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:26.940
and if you argued with that,
you're a villager,
you are a barbarian,

2496
02:23:26.941 --> 02:23:28.830
you are a simpleton.
You didn't understand.

2497
02:23:28.831 --> 02:23:31.560
You need corporations to run the world and you need,

2498
02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:35.190
if you're a sophisticated person,
you would bow down to the Fed and a,

2499
02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:37.470
and a multinational corporations,

2500
02:23:37.471 --> 02:23:42.180
you're very unsophisticated if you don't realize that corporations are human

2501
02:23:42.181 --> 02:23:46.320
beings and should be able to spend unlimited money in politics.
I mean,

2502
02:23:46.321 --> 02:23:47.640
look at that.
That's the other thing,
right?

2503
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:51.510
They all think the corporations are human beings.
I mean,

2504
02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:55.170
there's only three words that,
what the fuck?

2505
02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:57.630
<v 1>Yeah.
The idea that you do that and not,</v>

2506
02:23:58.110 --> 02:24:03.110
not address the diffusion of responsibility that comes with large groups act as

2507
02:24:03.481 --> 02:24:07.230
a large group.
The people inside that large group go,
well,
you know,

2508
02:24:07.231 --> 02:24:10.640
I'm just a part of this company now that is businesses,
businesses and a well I,

2509
02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:12.720
when we're moving to Mexico,
you know,

2510
02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:13.541
<v 2>and if you look,</v>

2511
02:24:13.541 --> 02:24:18.400
there's a woman and that was part of a insurance company in California.

2512
02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:20.770
She was a high level executive.
They raised the rates.

2513
02:24:20.771 --> 02:24:25.120
So when you're 39% on individual insurance,
and she said,
that's inhumane,

2514
02:24:25.121 --> 02:24:28.810
you can't do that.
People will lose their insurance and they'll die.
Right?

2515
02:24:28.811 --> 02:24:32.260
This was before Obamacare and they said,
oh,
that's really interesting opinion.

2516
02:24:32.261 --> 02:24:34.270
You're fired.
Okay,

2517
02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:37.990
so the machine will replace anyone with a conscience.

2518
02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:42.100
She had a conscious and she was immediately replaced with someone who does not

2519
02:24:42.101 --> 02:24:44.920
have a conscience because if they had a conscious they'd be replaced.

2520
02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:49.360
So we liked the media that people who are at the top levels of the media today

2521
02:24:49.390 --> 02:24:51.280
on the old media,
television,
et Cetera,

2522
02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:54.070
they didn't get there by being the smartest,
the most successful,

2523
02:24:54.071 --> 02:24:56.350
the best investigative reporters.
No,
no.

2524
02:24:56.380 --> 02:24:59.830
They got there because they were the ones who are willing to play ball.

2525
02:24:59.890 --> 02:25:04.360
The system rewards people willing to perpetuate the system.
Okay.

2526
02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:07.300
Now,
like we talked about a couple of hours ago,

2527
02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:11.530
that is now running into the wolf pack of the Internet,
right?

2528
02:25:11.890 --> 02:25:15.700
So there's a wolf pack literally that we've formed for politics,

2529
02:25:15.701 --> 02:25:19.900
but like the Internet is a pack in and of itself and their hate that shit.

2530
02:25:19.901 --> 02:25:24.400
And they're tired of that shit.
So when those two forces collide,
well,

2531
02:25:24.401 --> 02:25:25.480
they're colliding right now.

2532
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:26.550
<v 1>They are colliding right now.</v>

2533
02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:30.720
And the Internet also realizes that this is the first time maybe ever that

2534
02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:34.530
people truly have had a voice in the ability to influence things like this.

2535
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:37.650
It really didn't exist before.
You can't really,
you know,

2536
02:25:37.651 --> 02:25:40.650
you couldn't get on reddit and just start a thread and that thread becomes a

2537
02:25:40.651 --> 02:25:44.380
fucking revolution.
It didn't,
there was no access before there.

2538
02:25:44.430 --> 02:25:46.350
Nothing you need to,
he could start a protest,

2539
02:25:46.351 --> 02:25:49.620
you could meet in Washington DC and they would fucking turn the hydrants on you

2540
02:25:49.621 --> 02:25:53.190
and,
and sick dogs on you and shut that shit down.
And then the news would give a,

2541
02:25:53.191 --> 02:25:57.660
a really distorted account of what actually happened.
And for most Americans,

2542
02:25:57.661 --> 02:26:01.620
that would be their version of the truth.
They would,
you know,
Kent State,

2543
02:26:01.650 --> 02:26:05.700
perfect example,
you know,
they shot a bunch of kids and that were protesting.

2544
02:26:05.850 --> 02:26:09.620
The National Guard comes in,
shoots these fucking kids and what,
what it that,

2545
02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:13.380
I mean there was outrage because people got shot.
But w what was the,
the,

2546
02:26:13.381 --> 02:26:16.800
the official story that got broadcast on the news?
I mean,

2547
02:26:16.801 --> 02:26:18.520
what was the story that most American,

2548
02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:21.990
it took years before people deciphered it and saw what was really going on.

2549
02:26:22.350 --> 02:26:26.310
I mean,
that has been the,
the media has had the ability to do that forever.

2550
02:26:26.311 --> 02:26:26.491
I mean,

2551
02:26:26.491 --> 02:26:30.330
that's how they pulled off the Gulf of Tonkin when they got on TV and said that,

2552
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:31.800
you know,
the North Vietnamese,

2553
02:26:31.801 --> 02:26:36.450
I've shot American submarines and sunk them off the Gulf of Tonkin.
Holy Shit.

2554
02:26:36.451 --> 02:26:38.790
Where or the v meanwhile didn't even happen.

2555
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:41.850
They just broadcast something on television.

2556
02:26:41.851 --> 02:26:46.620
That didn't even happen that it's very difficult to do that today.
Very,

2557
02:26:46.621 --> 02:26:47.630
very difficult to do that

2558
02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.870
<v 2>today.
So from time to time,</v>

2559
02:26:49.871 --> 02:26:52.210
people in the mainstream media will criticize like Rto,

2560
02:26:52.211 --> 02:26:54.900
they're run by the Russian government or Al Jazeera.

2561
02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:58.570
They're run by the government of Qatar.
So that,
that,
that has validity,
right?

2562
02:26:58.850 --> 02:27:02.530
Flip side is what CNN run by.
So thinking about this,

2563
02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:06.460
when's the last time you heard CNN say the Pentagon is lying?

2564
02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:12.420
Never.
Never.
Never.
Right.
So the pen,

2565
02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:17.070
does anyone in America actually believe that the Pentagon has never told a lie?

2566
02:27:17.490 --> 02:27:19.860
Really?
Just anyone.
Could anyone possibly believe that?

2567
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:22.470
So if the CNN never reports the truth,

2568
02:27:22.471 --> 02:27:25.140
it just reports whatever the Pentagon is saying,

2569
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:28.020
then how are they better than providence?

2570
02:27:28.050 --> 02:27:31.620
Let alone our tea or I'll just zero right there.

2571
02:27:31.890 --> 02:27:36.780
But in fact they're more devious in a sense because they have the veneer of

2572
02:27:36.810 --> 02:27:39.840
being a real media organization and journalists,

2573
02:27:39.841 --> 02:27:42.840
etc. But when you look past that,

2574
02:27:42.841 --> 02:27:45.990
vineer did do a better job than providence.
It's supporting the government.

2575
02:27:47.430 --> 02:27:47.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2576
02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:52.090
<v 2>Yeah,
that's creepy.
Okay.
And think about this.
What,
what,</v>

2577
02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:55.770
what's the last investigative reports CNM broke about the gun?

2578
02:27:59.010 --> 02:28:01.590
They don't even have MSK to reporters.
Is that amazing?

2579
02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:04.870
Largest cable news channel.
They're not anymore.
But they used to be right.

2580
02:28:04.871 --> 02:28:08.730
The most trusted name in news.
They don't actually want to know the news.

2581
02:28:09.330 --> 02:28:12.210
If you had an investigative reporters,
if I was running CNN,

2582
02:28:12.211 --> 02:28:13.800
I'd have an army of investigator.

2583
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:16.230
I've had a wolf pack of investigative reporters.
Right.

2584
02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:20.700
And I'd be a watchdog and I'd,
why don't they do that?

2585
02:28:20.701 --> 02:28:24.380
Cause they want to know they're going to get themselves in trouble if they find

2586
02:28:24.381 --> 02:28:25.550
out what the government's doing wrong.

2587
02:28:25.970 --> 02:28:27.770
That's why they don't have any investigative reporters.

2588
02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:30.320
Have you ever talked to Amber Lyon?
No.

2589
02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:32.360
<v 1>Uh,
used to work for CNN.</v>

2590
02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:37.370
She did this a detailed piece on Bahrain and then they turned it into

2591
02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:40.970
essentially an infomercial to get tourists to go to Bahrain mean she was,

2592
02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:42.590
<v 2>I just heard about that.
Yeah.</v>

2593
02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:45.740
<v 1>Spring snipers shooting protestors.</v>

2594
02:28:45.741 --> 02:28:49.580
And the whole thing was just a fucked system where you know,

2595
02:28:49.581 --> 02:28:51.200
you had an oligarchy,
you had this,

2596
02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:55.700
this guy who is in control of this country and just,
it was,

2597
02:28:55.730 --> 02:29:00.020
it was a very repressive government and very repressive scenario,

2598
02:29:00.021 --> 02:29:05.021
but it was also near Iran and we wanted to use their ports and we wanted it to

2599
02:29:06.051 --> 02:29:07.340
be able to control their ports.

2600
02:29:07.341 --> 02:29:09.620
So they had this relationship with the United States government.

2601
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:14.630
So they essentially bought time on CNN.
Did they squashed her piece,

2602
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:19.640
bought time on CNN and made like a tourist piece about Bahrain.

2603
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:24.020
<v 2>Look our beloved allies in the Gulf,
like Saudi Arabia.
What are they?</v>

2604
02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:26.710
They're the worst governments in the world.
Yeah.
I mean,

2605
02:29:26.711 --> 02:29:30.070
they're the most oppressive for 50% of their population,

2606
02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:33.700
let alone everything else.
50% are women drive.
Can't drive,

2607
02:29:33.940 --> 02:29:36.600
need permission to go outside from a male.

2608
02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:41.590
How fucked up is that?
Right.
And,
and by the way,

2609
02:29:41.591 --> 02:29:45.520
15 out of the 19 hijackers on nine 11 were Saudis.

2610
02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:49.660
They weren't Afghans.
They weren't Iraqis.
They were Saudis,
right?
Yeah.

2611
02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:53.470
And we never touched him.
Saudis are lovely.

2612
02:29:53.471 --> 02:29:55.720
The Saudis are great at if,

2613
02:29:55.721 --> 02:29:59.290
because as long as you're on the side of the Pentagon,
everybody just salutes.

2614
02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:02.800
It's a weird world we live in,
man.
One of the,

2615
02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:06.730
<v 1>the influence of money in politics is a,
it's so,</v>

2616
02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:10.450
it's so deep and so intertwined that there's parts of it that people ignore.

2617
02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:14.080
And one of the ones that I bring up all the time is cigarettes.

2618
02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:17.620
That you've never heard a politician ever say.

2619
02:30:17.650 --> 02:30:21.220
We have to make cigarettes illegal.
We have to stop cigarettes.

2620
02:30:21.221 --> 02:30:25.750
Cigarettes are killing almost a half a million Americans prematurely every year.

2621
02:30:25.751 --> 02:30:30.190
They die in horrible,
painful,
agonizing deaths.
We need to stop this.

2622
02:30:30.191 --> 02:30:31.390
This is a plague.

2623
02:30:31.570 --> 02:30:34.480
If there was a terrorist that came to our country and killed a half a million

2624
02:30:34.481 --> 02:30:38.170
people a year,
it would be our number one priority to eliminate that terrorist.

2625
02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:43.090
But meanwhile,
we have this public health problem.
You don't hear that ever.

2626
02:30:43.240 --> 02:30:46.420
You don't hear a peep out of these people with full knowledge.

2627
02:30:46.421 --> 02:30:49.810
Everyone has full knowledge of this,
but it's because the cigarette companies,

2628
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:54.990
the tobacco companies have given them untold billions of dollars of influence.

2629
02:30:55.210 --> 02:30:58.600
So because of that,
everybody shuts the fuck up when it comes to cigarettes.

2630
02:30:58.600 --> 02:30:59.010
That's my

2631
02:30:59.010 --> 02:31:02.730
<v 2>nickname for John Bayner used to be tobacco checks.
John Tobacco,
Czech Spain.</v>

2632
02:31:03.250 --> 02:31:06.480
Because early on in his career he got an a tiny bit of trouble.

2633
02:31:06.481 --> 02:31:10.680
Not that it mattered at all because he eventually now runs the house.
Right.
Uh,

2634
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:15.120
because he was literally handing out checks from the tobacco lobby on the floor

2635
02:31:15.121 --> 02:31:18.390
of the house as they were about to vote on a tobacco bill.

2636
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.180
<v 1>Wow.
Checks.
How much would the checks scores?
I don't remember that part,</v>

2637
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:29.310
but I would like to know the number yet.
Oh,
fuck you.
It's like a million.

2638
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:33.900
But isn't that like the picture of corruption?
Yes,
it is.

2639
02:31:33.901 --> 02:31:35.160
The picture of corruption that is it.

2640
02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:38.920
<v 2>And look at and look at what the system did.
It took that picture of corruption.</v>

2641
02:31:38.921 --> 02:31:42.940
The guy who was doing that,
John Tobacco checks Bainer and it put them to that

2642
02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:47.100
<v 1>top of the heap.
It didn't punish him at it,
rewarded him for that.</v>

2643
02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:48.270
Even the way he looks,

2644
02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:51.330
he looks like a character in a Batman movie that's about to make a terrible

2645
02:31:51.331 --> 02:31:55.830
decision.
You know,
it's got to allow some evil,
superior.
Look at that guy,

2646
02:31:56.530 --> 02:31:57.690
that fucking picture of him.

2647
02:31:57.790 --> 02:32:01.790
It just looks like a guy who's just about to fuck over everybody just when he's

2648
02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:03.420
got that look about them.
But you know,

2649
02:32:03.421 --> 02:32:06.960
if you become that guy and you exist in that world for that long,

2650
02:32:06.961 --> 02:32:10.740
you take on that look and you can just almost look through his eyes,

2651
02:32:10.741 --> 02:32:15.330
the window to the soul and see like this motherfucker needs,
oh Jesus.

2652
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:18.510
What's he doing in there?
And there's a lot of those guys,

2653
02:32:18.690 --> 02:32:21.960
a lot of those fucking guys,
lots of them.
It's amazing.

2654
02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.810
It's amazing how intertwined the system is.

2655
02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:28.170
And I wonder what it's going to take to untangle it.

2656
02:32:28.570 --> 02:32:32.820
I wonder if we're going to be able to see that in our lifetime.
Well,
I'm trying.

2657
02:32:32.970 --> 02:32:33.803
I know you are.

2658
02:32:33.810 --> 02:32:36.480
I know you are and I respect that very much and I support that very much.

2659
02:32:36.481 --> 02:32:39.300
I think it's an amazing thing and I think that even,
you know,

2660
02:32:39.390 --> 02:32:40.890
without the your wolf pack,

2661
02:32:40.891 --> 02:32:45.210
I think you're trying just by distributed information and by letting people know

2662
02:32:45.211 --> 02:32:45.681
the,
the,

2663
02:32:45.681 --> 02:32:50.681
the actual roots of it and you just get sort of getting to a points that are

2664
02:32:51.871 --> 02:32:56.010
being ignored by these influenced networks.
You know,

2665
02:32:56.290 --> 02:32:58.920
because the fact that you're not influenced by anything other than your own

2666
02:32:58.921 --> 02:33:02.100
opinions and the facts that at that present themselves to you.

2667
02:33:02.460 --> 02:33:05.440
That's super important,
man.
It's probably one of the most important things.

2668
02:33:05.441 --> 02:33:08.250
And I think when,
when history is,
you know,

2669
02:33:08.251 --> 02:33:11.220
written down in the future and we go over this era,

2670
02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:14.040
this will be the era of the Internet.
I really do believe that.

2671
02:33:14.041 --> 02:33:16.950
I believe that these decades,
this,
this,
you know,
30,

2672
02:33:16.951 --> 02:33:19.890
40 years from the point of,
you know,

2673
02:33:19.891 --> 02:33:24.870
the first initial introduction like the early nineties when it really became a

2674
02:33:24.871 --> 02:33:28.560
part of America to a where it eventually is going to go to.

2675
02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:31.800
I think this is going to be an incredible era of,
of,
of,

2676
02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:35.160
of change and have influence in a way that I don't think it's ever existed

2677
02:33:35.161 --> 02:33:38.400
before.
We're a part of it.
We're in the middle of it right now.

2678
02:33:38.401 --> 02:33:40.830
So I don't think we recognize it as my,
I think we do kind of,

2679
02:33:40.831 --> 02:33:43.860
we talk about it cause we were,
you know,
we literally are in it.

2680
02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:45.430
I mean we are one of the,

2681
02:33:45.431 --> 02:33:49.380
the people that's taking full advantage of this strange new time.
But I think,

2682
02:33:49.381 --> 02:33:50.880
well history looks back on it,
man.

2683
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:54.300
They're going to look back at it like this is a crazy fucking time.

2684
02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:58.500
And then they invented the Internet and the whole class goes,
ah,

2685
02:33:59.210 --> 02:34:02.160
<v 2>I know.
Yeah.
And so,
you know,</v>

2686
02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:05.550
to bring it back to our conversation about darkness and light.

2687
02:34:05.551 --> 02:34:09.780
And so the Pentagon,
that is this force of darkness for so many things,

2688
02:34:09.781 --> 02:34:13.480
unfortunately in the world invented the Internet.
Right?

2689
02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:18.460
<v 1>They fucked up.
So the overall</v>

2690
02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:21.460
<v 2>story is a little bit more complicated than that,
but they had a huge role in it.</v>

2691
02:34:21.490 --> 02:34:24.220
And so how's that for irony?
It's hilarious.

2692
02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:28.230
<v 1>I don't think anybody could have ever possibly saw this coming.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

2693
02:34:28.231 --> 02:34:31.260
I think if they could pull it back,
they probably would.
You know,

2694
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:36.650
that is the number one biggest problem to govern is,
is the,

2695
02:34:36.651 --> 02:34:41.040
the ability that people have today to express themselves and exchange

2696
02:34:41.041 --> 02:34:46.041
information and the access to that information being almost completely permeated

2697
02:34:46.861 --> 02:34:49.560
into our society.
I mean,
it's almost complete.
It's almost everywhere.
I mean,

2698
02:34:49.770 --> 02:34:52.330
you basically get the news on your fucking microwave now.
I mean,
it's just,

2699
02:34:52.331 --> 02:34:55.770
it's too much,
too much information now.
She can't hold it back.

2700
02:34:55.890 --> 02:34:58.560
<v 2>So that's the thing,
you know,
what does the government always tried to do?</v>

2701
02:34:58.561 --> 02:35:01.890
Because it most important thing is information and knowledge.

2702
02:35:01.891 --> 02:35:03.900
So they try to collect all the information on you.

2703
02:35:03.901 --> 02:35:07.440
That's why they do wiretapping of 300 million Americans.
Right?

2704
02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:11.100
Because they want all the info on you.
But like today,

2705
02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:15.520
a story we're going to do on the young Turks,
a woman getting arrested,
uh,

2706
02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:20.590
winds up a audio recording,
they'll arrest the cops.
Say That,

2707
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.880
well you did not get our permission.
You wire tapped us.

2708
02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:26.670
So they put an extra charge on her.
Okay,

2709
02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:29.610
we're allowed to wiretap the fuck out of you.
Right.

2710
02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:32.730
But if you dare record us arresting you,

2711
02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:35.430
you're broken a wire tapping laws credible.
Yup.

2712
02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:38.820
That's because the government knows how powerful information is.

2713
02:35:39.090 --> 02:35:42.450
That's why they think we must have access to that tool.

2714
02:35:42.451 --> 02:35:46.260
And you can't have access to that tool.
Right.
But they fucked up.

2715
02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:48.750
Now the Internet's out there and,

2716
02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:53.610
and that's why they do net neutrality cause they want to kill net neutrality so

2717
02:35:53.611 --> 02:35:56.130
they can try to put the genie back in the bottle.

2718
02:35:56.310 --> 02:35:57.410
<v 1>Did you hear about this?
Uh,</v>

2719
02:35:57.490 --> 02:36:02.490
this guy who is some net administrator that cut the fccs a pipe to the internet.

2720
02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:08.980
<v 2>Love that state date.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What was the website?
Shoot,
I forgot,</v>

2721
02:36:10.210 --> 02:36:12.770
but he's like,
oh no,
no,
it's no big deal.
You're right.

2722
02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:15.470
Let's make it a transaction.
You know,
you guys like transactions,

2723
02:36:15.471 --> 02:36:19.370
you want Verizon to have the ability and Comcast have the ability to bring it

2724
02:36:19.371 --> 02:36:20.410
down for,
uh,

2725
02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:24.890
my speed on the Internet and then pay more in order to speed it back up.
Great.

2726
02:36:24.891 --> 02:36:29.090
So give me 1000 bucks and I'll speed it back up for you.
Your FCC website,

2727
02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:31.850
like outrageous.
What do you mean outrageous?
That's the system you want.

2728
02:36:32.590 --> 02:36:33.530
It's fucking brilliant.

2729
02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:35.410
<v 1>Yeah,
it is fucking brilliant.
Yeah.</v>

2730
02:36:35.411 --> 02:36:39.080
And then this net neutrality thing to try to get rid of that is,

2731
02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:43.570
is a very creepy precedent because to give anybody in,
in control,

2732
02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:47.410
anybody with power and influence the control of the distribution of information,

2733
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:50.350
that's the very thing that's,
that's endangering their,

2734
02:36:50.351 --> 02:36:54.610
their power and control that distribution of information and that transparency

2735
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:58.210
that's showing what these fuckers are up to.
I mean,

2736
02:36:58.330 --> 02:37:01.780
not enough people are up in arms,
in my opinion.
It seems to be a thing that's a,

2737
02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.920
it's escaped largely because it's being ignored by the mainstream media.

2738
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:07.180
You're not seeing these stores,

2739
02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:12.070
you're not seeing these horrible stories of outrage all over CNN and Fox News.

2740
02:37:12.090 --> 02:37:14.560
You're not seeing them.
You're not,
you're not saying people freak out.

2741
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:15.853
<v 2>You want to know why.</v>

2742
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:18.860
<v 1>Okay,
so number one,</v>

2743
02:37:20.170 --> 02:37:23.600
internet is direct competition to old media like television.

2744
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:27.560
Why would they want to support it?
Okay,
so that's one.
But more importantly,

2745
02:37:28.310 --> 02:37:30.830
all the dirty money in politics.
Where does it go?

2746
02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:36.530
He goes to buying TV ads.
So you think TV,

2747
02:37:36.531 --> 02:37:38.120
is it going to be against money in politics?

2748
02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:40.250
You think TV is going to be open to the Internet,

2749
02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:44.450
bring you that information so the politicians aren't hooked on the TV ads?

2750
02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:47.330
Hell No.
Hell No.

2751
02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:50.600
Nothing wants to eliminate the internet,

2752
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:55.250
the free flow of information and keep money in politics more than television

2753
02:37:55.251 --> 02:38:00.180
does.
Hmm,
amazing.
It's your doom TV.

2754
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:04.520
It's not gonna make it and now going to make it.
It's not gonna last.
It's gonna.

2755
02:38:04.530 --> 02:38:07.860
It's also you're,
you're,
you're going to be able to,
like,

2756
02:38:07.861 --> 02:38:10.180
you see these new shows that are being developed.

2757
02:38:10.181 --> 02:38:13.950
The school is over for the Internet,
like house of cards on Netflix.
And you're,

2758
02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.290
that's just the beginning.
It's the tip of the iceberg.

2759
02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:19.040
And I think shows like yours and,
and,

2760
02:38:19.050 --> 02:38:22.230
and these all these various shows that just popping up on the Internet,

2761
02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:25.920
they're going to replace everything you see on television except big budget.

2762
02:38:25.921 --> 02:38:27.890
Things like maybe game of Thrones that'll,
that'll,

2763
02:38:27.930 --> 02:38:31.010
those things we'll hang on first of all because they're awesome.
And two,

2764
02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:35.250
because it's really fucking expensive to make these gigantic,
huge,

2765
02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:36.480
you know,

2766
02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.920
shows where you have special effects and just incredible theatrical productions.

2767
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:44.040
Those are going to be the most difficult to replace the captain America movies,

2768
02:38:44.041 --> 02:38:46.560
things along those lines.
But everything else.

2769
02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:51.470
<v 2>So first of all,
if Edwards no,
never gets caught,
uh,
it's no problem.
She just,</v>

2770
02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:55.880
Amanda come a trial by combat and then we can solve this whole thing.

2771
02:38:55.881 --> 02:38:58.700
Did you watch the last episode of Game of Thrones?
Don't say anything.
No,

2772
02:38:58.701 --> 02:39:03.150
I haven't.
Okay.
Last night.
Alright.
Nothing.
Well they say a word.
Okay.
All right.

2773
02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:08.360
Sorry,
I didn't know what you just said.
La,
la,
la,
la La.

2774
02:39:09.290 --> 02:39:11.490
Okay.
Sorry.
Too much information there.

2775
02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:16.790
So they're trying to hold things at bay.
Right?

2776
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:19.960
But it's like a Zombie movie with the things that you know,

2777
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:21.770
we're going to crawl over the walls.

2778
02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:26.780
You can't build a wall a large enough and they're fighting a losing battle,

2779
02:39:26.781 --> 02:39:29.900
but they don't know it.
So of course like here,
I'll give you my example.

2780
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:34.970
When I was at MSNBC,
I was getting about 700,009 700,000 people at night.

2781
02:39:34.971 --> 02:39:36.410
That was a very good number back then.

2782
02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:40.130
It's still a very good number right on our network.

2783
02:39:40.131 --> 02:39:42.410
We get about 2.1 million views a day,

2784
02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:47.600
so three times larger than our cable news show.

2785
02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:50.330
Ooh,
Cable News,
MSNBC,
wow.

2786
02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:53.780
700002.1 million now without TV.

2787
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:58.250
So they can keep wishing it away,
but it isn't going away.

2788
02:39:58.310 --> 02:40:02.470
And every day TV gets smaller,
we get larger.
Well

2789
02:40:02.490 --> 02:40:02.800
<v 1>use.</v>

2790
02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:07.000
You're also available instantaneously on a cell phone while you're on a subway.

2791
02:40:07.330 --> 02:40:10.780
That's the difference.
Like do you could get you so much easier.

2792
02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:14.280
The audio version of your show,
the video version,
that youtube,

2793
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:15.930
you can get it anywhere.
You know,

2794
02:40:15.931 --> 02:40:17.850
you could get it while you were on a fucking plane.

2795
02:40:18.270 --> 02:40:22.020
You could watch the youtube clips while you're on a plane flying over the
planet.

2796
02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:26.100
He can't really do that is,
no,
they don't.
They're,
they're model is so antiquated.

2797
02:40:26.101 --> 02:40:28.200
They acts as the on demand access is really,

2798
02:40:28.530 --> 02:40:31.260
it's very limited in comparison to what's available on the Internet.

2799
02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:35.440
<v 2>And then when they tried to compete with us on the Internet,
look at CNN,</v>

2800
02:40:35.441 --> 02:40:38.710
puts out a news clip,
like who cares what you think man?

2801
02:40:39.070 --> 02:40:43.420
Like Wolf Blitzer,
if you take away the CNN stuff and put them on the Internet,

2802
02:40:43.421 --> 02:40:47.050
and I said,
okay,
go get 'em wolf.
You're going to fail miserably.

2803
02:40:47.250 --> 02:40:49.360
We get like negative 17 views.
Yeah,

2804
02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:53.970
<v 1>like in a fail miserably and there's no way you're going to have enough</v>

2805
02:40:53.971 --> 02:40:58.050
personalities that are willing to freely express themselves.
They don't exist.

2806
02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:02.280
They just don't exist on TV.
No,
they don't exist.
So what are you going to do?

2807
02:41:02.281 --> 02:41:05.520
You're going to find Internet people that are going to just work for you and

2808
02:41:05.521 --> 02:41:06.780
then what are they going that you're going to mold

2809
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:10.110
<v 2>them?
Joe Again,
you nailed it.
That's exactly what they're trying to do.</v>

2810
02:41:10.111 --> 02:41:14.880
Now they've are,
they,
we've gotten offers,
uh,
at at least three of our hosts,

2811
02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:18.900
two of them,
uh,
who've taken it cause so much more money to go to TV,
et Cetera.

2812
02:41:18.901 --> 02:41:20.490
Right?
Cause they think,
oh great,

2813
02:41:20.491 --> 02:41:24.570
we'll take the internet host and then we'll mold them to be TV and then we'll,

2814
02:41:24.571 --> 02:41:28.410
they'll be just as popular.
Right?
But that's what Msnbc did with me.
Oh,

2815
02:41:28.411 --> 02:41:30.000
incredibly popular guy online.

2816
02:41:30.001 --> 02:41:33.350
We'll just make him senatorial and establishment and,

2817
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:35.880
but that's not what made me popular in the first place.

2818
02:41:35.881 --> 02:41:39.960
You miss the whole fucking point,
right?
And Look,
I love my host there.

2819
02:41:39.961 --> 02:41:40.920
We've got a great,

2820
02:41:41.250 --> 02:41:45.780
like set a host on the TYT network and I'm one of them.

2821
02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:49.620
It's not us,
it's not the host.
It's the idea.
And if it wasn't us,

2822
02:41:49.621 --> 02:41:51.150
it'd be somebody else,
right?

2823
02:41:51.330 --> 02:41:54.120
It's the idea that we're not going to serve the advertisers.

2824
02:41:54.121 --> 02:41:56.400
We're not going to serve the corporate parents.

2825
02:41:56.401 --> 02:41:59.880
We're not going to serve the politicians for access to celebrities for access.

2826
02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:03.390
We're going to serve the audience,
we're going to serve the audience.

2827
02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:05.220
And so how are they going to compete with,

2828
02:42:05.221 --> 02:42:06.240
they're not going to compete with that.

2829
02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:08.150
<v 1>They're not.
Because someone can just set up a desk,</v>

2830
02:42:08.151 --> 02:42:09.440
put a camera in front of that desk,

2831
02:42:09.441 --> 02:42:14.120
connect that camera to the Internet ready roll.
And they could do just as good.

2832
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:15.440
I mean,
they can have a show.

2833
02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:19.070
You did it from your fucking living room 12 years ago and look at you today.

2834
02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:23.170
<v 2>And if let's say that they somehow coopt us and we sell out,
right?</v>

2835
02:42:23.690 --> 02:42:27.180
<v 4>Someone else,
somebody else will replace Alex Jones.
He's waiting.
He's in Austin,</v>

2836
02:42:27.181 --> 02:42:30.270
Texas.
You say you're the number one,
but I've got the statistics.

2837
02:42:30.330 --> 02:42:32.970
I've got the documents right here and show you a liar.

2838
02:42:32.971 --> 02:42:35.730
Jank you're a new world order puppet.

2839
02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:39.030
He seems like he's out there working for the people.

2840
02:42:39.031 --> 02:42:42.390
He's not working for the people he went for MSNBC.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2841
02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:47.190
you don't get to Msnbc unless you sell your soul to David dykes.
Reptilians

2842
02:42:48.330 --> 02:42:49.620
<v 2>that was awesome.</v>

2843
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.690
<v 4>I've never,
I've never,
I never heard you do that.
That's,
that was amazing.</v>

2844
02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:58.110
<v 1>I've known that dude for a long time.
Alex Jones.
I in,
uh,</v>

2845
02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:02.870
1999,
I did a,
a,
a DVD in Austin,

2846
02:43:02.871 --> 02:43:07.250
Texas and Alex Jones and I put on Bush masks.
I was a Bush Jr.

2847
02:43:07.251 --> 02:43:09.340
He was Bush senior and we,
uh,
we,

2848
02:43:09.341 --> 02:43:13.870
we wear these outfits and ran around the Capitol and it was called the live from

2849
02:43:13.871 --> 02:43:18.220
the belly of the beast.
It was right before Bush senior got elected.
And,
uh,
I've,

2850
02:43:18.221 --> 02:43:21.520
I've known him for even before then.
I've known that guy for a long time.

2851
02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:26.490
<v 2>My theory is that Alex is a false flag operation.
Really?
Yeah.
Is that a real,</v>

2852
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:29.580
a real theory?
Kind of.
I'm half kidding.
Half serious.

2853
02:43:29.970 --> 02:43:31.800
You say that because you're trying to fuck with me.

2854
02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:35.730
What he's trying to do right now is co-op my mind.
I'm sitting here in Austin,

2855
02:43:35.731 --> 02:43:38.070
Texas.
I'm smoking cigarettes,
I'm drinking whiskey.

2856
02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:41.790
I'm getting fucking crazy trying to protect people from the government as black

2857
02:43:41.791 --> 02:43:44.550
helicopters.
They're flying over my dodge charger.

2858
02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:50.540
So that is as good an impersonation of anyone that anyone has ever done.

2859
02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:55.050
Well,
I've been around the dude,
like I said,
for a long time.
I know him very well.

2860
02:43:55.051 --> 02:43:59.640
So here's the false flag.
A conspiracy on Alex.
Okay,
let me hear the conspiracy.

2861
02:43:59.641 --> 02:44:01.740
If you were gonna do a bunch of conspiracies,

2862
02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:04.680
but you wanted to discredit the idea that conspiracies happen,

2863
02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:10.160
you would create someone like Alex Jones who would say plausible things like 25%

2864
02:44:10.531 --> 02:44:14.130
33% of it makes perfect sense.
And then on top of that,

2865
02:44:14.131 --> 02:44:18.390
you would add reptilians so that people will go,
oh,

2866
02:44:18.391 --> 02:44:22.590
that's just crazy talk.
Oh yeah.
A Gulf of Tonkin.

2867
02:44:22.591 --> 02:44:26.190
You think the government sat that up?
Oh,
you also think there's loser people.

2868
02:44:26.370 --> 02:44:29.730
You're one of those Alex goes guys chem trails.

2869
02:44:31.570 --> 02:44:33.380
<v 1>You see what I'm saying?
I um,</v>

2870
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:38.380
I know him too well to believe that I,
I'm,
I'm friends with Alex.

2871
02:44:38.381 --> 02:44:40.330
I know him very well.
I would love to get the two of you together.

2872
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:43.250
<v 2>It'd be a fascinating conversation.
No,
I've gone on his show.</v>

2873
02:44:43.251 --> 02:44:45.560
He's come on my show and like,

2874
02:44:46.190 --> 02:44:51.140
<v 1>he's not what you think he is.
He's,
he's a little,
he's definitely crazy.</v>

2875
02:44:51.470 --> 02:44:55.790
He's a little unhinged,
but uh,
he really,
um,

2876
02:44:56.990 --> 02:45:01.880
he believes what he's saying.
He really does.
He might not be right.

2877
02:45:02.030 --> 02:45:06.230
And he might jump to conclusions too often and he might cite statistics.

2878
02:45:06.231 --> 02:45:09.350
It may or may not actually exist or be factual,

2879
02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:13.120
but he's right a lot of the time.
And that's what's really fucking crazy.
He,

2880
02:45:13.260 --> 02:45:16.890
he made a video a long time ago,
um,

2881
02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:21.710
and it was a nine one one the road to conspiracy or the road to tyranny and it

2882
02:45:21.711 --> 02:45:26.330
wasn't just about nine 11 what it was about,
not just false flag operations,

2883
02:45:26.331 --> 02:45:29.990
but it was a lot agent provocateurs that I really wasn't aware of.

2884
02:45:30.170 --> 02:45:34.550
I wasn't aware that they will use hired people,

2885
02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:37.940
whether,
you know,
calm government agents,
call them soldiers,
whatever.
They,

2886
02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:43.360
they used people where they paid these people to infiltrate peaceful protests

2887
02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:48.470
and start chaos,
break windows,
light fires,

2888
02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:53.510
do all these things so that they would have the motivation or the,
uh,
the,

2889
02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:53.980
they,
they,

2890
02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:58.980
they would have the green light to send in the troops to stop all these protests

2891
02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:00.680
because the protest turned violent.

2892
02:46:00.890 --> 02:46:03.740
So they turned the protest violence and I was like,
wow,
that is crazy.

2893
02:46:03.741 --> 02:46:07.250
And then the expression agent provocateur,
I'd never heard of it at the time,

2894
02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:12.380
but he does a job of detailing it in his video and,
and showing it,

2895
02:46:12.381 --> 02:46:14.450
not just step by step along the way,

2896
02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.140
videotaping these people that were wearing fucking,
there weren't ski masks.

2897
02:46:18.141 --> 02:46:22.510
They wear a military order boots.
I mean the military issue boots.
I mean they,

2898
02:46:22.511 --> 02:46:25.220
they,
he shows the photos of the bottoms of these boots.
He's like,

2899
02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:27.770
these people are all wearing the same boots,
ladies and gentlemen.

2900
02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:30.710
These boots are the same boots you will see on soldiers.

2901
02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:35.240
You'll see on police officers.
And he also detailed how they were all let off,

2902
02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:37.010
how they all,
they,
they,
they,
they,

2903
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:40.370
they coordinate him off in a building and instead of moving them in and

2904
02:46:40.371 --> 02:46:42.490
arresting them,
they had some sort of a negotiation.

2905
02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:44.270
They found a wound up letting them go.

2906
02:46:44.730 --> 02:46:48.060
<v 2>So I don't know about the details of that,
but I do know that of course,</v>

2907
02:46:48.061 --> 02:46:51.720
conspiracies exist in the real world.
So,
and false flag operations exist.

2908
02:46:51.721 --> 02:46:55.440
The Turkish government just got caught on tape with one of what wasn't.
So,
uh,

2909
02:46:55.441 --> 02:46:57.360
the foreign minister,
um,

2910
02:46:57.750 --> 02:47:00.460
was talking to some of the,

2911
02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:04.980
the generals or whoever it was that it was going to do this.
And uh,

2912
02:47:05.010 --> 02:47:09.870
he said,
we have a compound within Syria.
They do,
it's to protect,
um,

2913
02:47:10.530 --> 02:47:13.780
uh,
religious,
uh,
area,
uh,
within Syria.

2914
02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.040
Turkey controls for some obscure reason,
right?
He said,

2915
02:47:17.041 --> 02:47:19.020
why don't we attack that and pretend the Syrians did it?

2916
02:47:19.380 --> 02:47:22.260
And then that'll give us an opportunity to go into Syria right before the

2917
02:47:22.261 --> 02:47:25.770
elections.
So that will rally the whole country to our side.

2918
02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:28.300
It's on tape.
That's why,

2919
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:31.590
that's why the Turkish government shut down youtube and Twitter for awhile

2920
02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:34.890
because the tapes,
of course,
you're not going to see that in Turkish television.

2921
02:47:34.890 --> 02:47:38.190
They're just as controlled by the Turkish government as any of these are.
Right.

2922
02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:39.570
So that's,

2923
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:43.050
and then they couldn't control Twitter and Youtube and the prime minister

2924
02:47:43.051 --> 02:47:43.980
started losing it.

2925
02:47:44.070 --> 02:47:47.460
So he just shut down all of you to cause those tapes made it out there.

2926
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:50.970
So that stuff definitely exists.
Well,
it drives me crazy about Alex and I,

2927
02:47:50.971 --> 02:47:52.110
if you've known him that long,

2928
02:47:52.111 --> 02:47:55.320
of course I trust you that he's not an actual false flag operation.
Might be,

2929
02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:57.510
I might be wrong,
I don't think I'm wrong,

2930
02:47:57.540 --> 02:48:00.720
but what drives me crazy about Alex is that then he'll start talking about how

2931
02:48:00.721 --> 02:48:04.020
the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers want to kill off 90% of humanity.

2932
02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:07.650
And I'm like,
no,
no.
Then you're going to stop.
Then you won't get it.

2933
02:48:07.700 --> 02:48:10.130
<v 1>People like,
that's crazy.
That's not true.</v>

2934
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:13.190
You don't understand chank it's about life extension technology,

2935
02:48:13.191 --> 02:48:14.780
live extension technology.
What they're,

2936
02:48:14.890 --> 02:48:18.790
what they're planning on doing is taking babies.
They'll extract,
the fetus isn't,

2937
02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:23.540
they're going to put them in your corn flakes with radio ID,
cit,
RFID chips.

2938
02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:28.340
He'll,
he'll go into,
we w we have the documents,

2939
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:30.500
we have the documents right here.
I'll show them to you after your show.

2940
02:48:30.570 --> 02:48:34.530
<v 2>Oh yeah.
And then,
and then people shut down and they go,
oh,
okay,</v>

2941
02:48:34.531 --> 02:48:38.070
well then that must all be full of shit.
So let's chem trails.

2942
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:44.950
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
I know.
I agree.</v>

2943
02:48:44.980 --> 02:48:47.950
I agree that there's no evidence whatsoever that they want to kill off a giant

2944
02:48:47.951 --> 02:48:51.400
percentage of the population mean they used like the Georgia Guidestones is like

2945
02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:52.940
the evidence of this.
Like you know,

2946
02:48:53.050 --> 02:48:57.670
keep your population below 500 million on the world.
I,
I'm with you.

2947
02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:02.530
I don't agree with all of its conclusions,
you know,
at all.
Not even a little bit,

2948
02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:06.340
but I think having a loony toon dude out there like that,

2949
02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:09.750
pushing buttons and pulling chords.
What's interesting is some things,

2950
02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:13.890
sometimes things get brought to light like the Bohemian Grove,

2951
02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.300
like wait a minute.
World leaders really do dress up like fucking like,
like,

2952
02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:23.560
like Obi wan Kenobi and light an effigy on fire under the Molik the owl God

2953
02:49:25.771 --> 02:49:27.780
statue.
Like what the fuck?

2954
02:49:27.781 --> 02:49:31.200
Like these are world leaders and bankers and these people really do meet there

2955
02:49:31.201 --> 02:49:31.501
every year.

2956
02:49:31.501 --> 02:49:35.130
I mean he really did uncover that there's the weird skull and bones type shit he

2957
02:49:35.131 --> 02:49:39.270
was talking about that way before the John Kerry a Bush election.

2958
02:49:39.610 --> 02:49:43.390
<v 2>So oftentimes the great majority of the time,
in my opinion,</v>

2959
02:49:43.391 --> 02:49:44.740
there is no cigar filled room.

2960
02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:48.890
It's just you build a system and it rewards certain things and provides this

2961
02:49:48.891 --> 02:49:51.700
incentives for other things.
And that's why you have people,

2962
02:49:51.701 --> 02:49:55.600
news actors who do what they do.
You have Barack Obama who does what he does,

2963
02:49:56.050 --> 02:49:59.180
but sometimes there is a smoke filled room.
Hey,

2964
02:49:59.470 --> 02:50:03.940
sometimes you get a speech at Msnbc saying,
no,
no,
no,
you didn't get the message.

2965
02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:06.100
You got to act like the establishment,
right?
Yeah.

2966
02:50:06.190 --> 02:50:11.190
And sometimes you have these crazy guys like real important people dress up in

2967
02:50:11.891 --> 02:50:15.270
funny costumes,
get together and pat each other in the ass.
And

2968
02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.190
that's real.
And that's trippy man.
It trippy.
I mean look,

2969
02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:24.730
it's so when you go back to the masonic lodges and stuff,

2970
02:50:24.731 --> 02:50:28.360
that's like powerful gift people getting together and doing each other solids,

2971
02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:32.110
right?
Yeah.
And,
and they,
they want to feel better about it.

2972
02:50:32.111 --> 02:50:35.980
So they would do a club and their fraternity or whatever they are and they wear

2973
02:50:35.981 --> 02:50:37.120
funny hats and

2974
02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:37.581
<v 1>Oh,
how old?</v>

2975
02:50:37.581 --> 02:50:40.910
When you look at dollar bills and you see all the fucking cryptic shit on there

2976
02:50:40.911 --> 02:50:44.260
and the the pyramid with the eye above it.
Like what,
what,

2977
02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:48.560
what's going on here man?
What exactly is all this?
What are you guys up to?

2978
02:50:48.850 --> 02:50:50.570
Like what's going on behind the scenes?

2979
02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:54.460
<v 2>So Dan Brown and what was the famous book?
DIVINCI code.
Yeah,</v>

2980
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:59.290
so the one thing I got out of that book was,
well he's right.

2981
02:50:59.291 --> 02:51:03.850
I mean the symbols did get there for a reason.
There's symbols all around us.

2982
02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:06.790
They did mean something at sometime to somebody.

2983
02:51:07.090 --> 02:51:09.910
So it's not an accident that there an eye on the pyramid.

2984
02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:13.990
I don't know what it means and I'm not sure that it's nefarious and I'm positive

2985
02:51:13.991 --> 02:51:17.920
it's not about the lizard people,
but you know,

2986
02:51:17.921 --> 02:51:20.830
at some point and look,
the masonic lodges were probably good things.

2987
02:51:20.831 --> 02:51:22.780
You know what,
my guests,
I have no idea.

2988
02:51:22.781 --> 02:51:26.080
But my guess is that those are the people who were smart enough to get together

2989
02:51:26.081 --> 02:51:28.840
and be like,
yeah,
religious bullshit.
Right?
We all agree.
Yeah,

2990
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:29.890
it's totally bullshit.
Okay.

2991
02:51:29.891 --> 02:51:33.790
Now let's like come up with logical shed to actually run this place cause

2992
02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:37.180
they're villagers out there believe in nonsense.

2993
02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:40.060
So let's come up with logical rules.
Do you see what I'm saying?

2994
02:51:41.230 --> 02:51:42.670
So it might've had a good time and then,

2995
02:51:42.671 --> 02:51:45.820
but then once you get Pete powerful people in the room,
they're like,
we should,

2996
02:51:45.821 --> 02:51:48.580
we should set the rules in our favor,
right?
Yeah,
I agree.
Yup.
Yup.

2997
02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:53.200
<v 1>Yeah,
exactly.
Info wars.com ladies and gentlemen,
for more details we are,</v>

2998
02:51:53.201 --> 02:51:56.470
we're at a time,
man,
we,
we ran into three hours.
That was,
it flew by.

2999
02:51:56.590 --> 02:51:58.660
We could do another three like that.
Easily.

3000
02:51:58.810 --> 02:52:02.290
<v 2>You don't what it wound up being like my first show ever a half about politics</v>

3001
02:52:02.291 --> 02:52:04.160
have about philosophy.
That's okay.

3002
02:52:04.610 --> 02:52:09.250
<v 1>Yeah man.
That's kind of how we kind of all seems to fall into that.</v>

3003
02:52:09.251 --> 02:52:12.760
Well that's kind of life,
right?
It isn't it.
It's about like who's running us?

3004
02:52:12.761 --> 02:52:16.900
Why do we think the way you think sex,
all those things.
Food.
Oh,

3005
02:52:16.901 --> 02:52:18.010
everything gets lumped in together.

3006
02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:20.830
<v 2>We could have talked about sex a little bit more,
but that's okay.
Next time.</v>

3007
02:52:20.831 --> 02:52:23.740
Next time.
Next time.
Thank you brother.
It was a lot of fun,
man.

3008
02:52:23.741 --> 02:52:26.770
I really appreciate it.
Oh No,
no.
This is incredible conversation.

3009
02:52:26.771 --> 02:52:29.530
I'm glad we finally got got this done.
We'll do it more often.
No,

I'll do yours too,

Absolutely.
Absolutely love.
This is my kind of show.

3011
02:52:34.301 --> 02:52:35.750
So,

3012

Yeah.

3019
02:53:02.300 --> 02:53:04.720
Isn't even making everybody else have that haircut too,
isn't not the rule.

3020
02:53:04.721 --> 02:53:08.800
It's a rumor,
but I think it's probably unsubstantiated government propaganda.
