<v Speaker 1>basically yet ray bans and I got him.</v>

10
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Normally detector would not wear a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket protector.</v>

11
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wears him anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

14
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of scientific character</v>

17
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you can get a costume for like 10 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a dollar 50.</v>

18
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>You would have taken me months to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>this on the street.</v>

19
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you find a pocket protector?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ebay and the tie,</v>

22
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:52.660

<v Speaker 1>It's a great example.</v>

25
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to find this in New York.</v>

26
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It took me like two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go to a uniform supply store.</v>

27
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Huge pain in the ass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>two seconds.</v>

30
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>that you wear with a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an odd look.</v>

31
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm formal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not because I need my forearms</v>

<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what the answer is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your profile because I think you get</v>

53
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>lumped into like a lot of like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up crazy people because you've</v>

54
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>got some controversial ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like what you did.</v>

55
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I liked this pro west pro gun pro life</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro gay pro Israel pro trump,</v>

56
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 1>anti Nazi.</v>

57
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Antifa is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it all the time.</v>

58
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you can explain it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

59
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>anticensorship antifeminist anti Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He leave your heart on your sleeve.</v>

60
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You've got it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really handy to do that.</v>

61
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I just did that about a week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in this day and age,</v>

62
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>we're in a weird era where it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy age.</v>

63
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>We're all Romans all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like socrates sitting here</v>

64
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 1>philosophizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of have to make everyone</v>

65
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>know exactly where you stand on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>

66
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're slightly right of</v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

67
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>your alt right and your go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

68
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>those guys hate me but I hate these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm right.</v>

69
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You're pro gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I think gays are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born gay and the idea that I</v>

71
00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've,</v>

72
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I lived in the city since I was 18 so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been around gays for a quarter</v>

73
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>century and I think of these guys I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been together for 10 years and</v>

74
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me get this straight.</v>

75
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two are going to break up</v>

76
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>according to you and evangelical person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're just going to make out</v>

77
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>with some chick with blonde hair and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>her out</v>

78
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>and like fucker and have a boner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pray to God.</v>

79
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd know that won't happen.</v>

80
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of homosexual behavior</v>

81
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>could be induced by molestation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>early age though.</v>

82
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the million dollar question</v>

83
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>because that seems to be a real factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

84
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the nine people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>born gay,</v>

85
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a spectrum and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's most certainly some gay</v>

86
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.851
<v Speaker 1>acts that are committed on young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and horrifically those people tend to on</v>

87
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>a a pretty frequent basis do the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to other young kids,</v>

88
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Weird in,</v>

89
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like the victims becoming</v>

90
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>the victimizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I know where you're going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're walking into the elephant in the</v>

92
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.191
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of,</v>

93
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>not even mean just just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to the George to Chi</v>

94
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>interview today because they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull up everybody now that the Milo</v>

95
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>thing is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling up everybody who in any</v>

96
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>way it has condoned sex with underage</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

97
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And George to Kai was talking about his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own experiences in camp and it was on</v>

98
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the stern show and he was just talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what he,</v>

99
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the way he was describing it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive experience with a kid who was</v>

100
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>in his late teens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said he was 19 and he was</v>

101
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>like 13 somewhere in that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

102
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely child molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely illegal.</v>

103
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>But the way he was describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty much describing it as a</v>

104
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>positive experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Which when it's your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

106
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy did something that was against</v>

107
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>

108
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird area because it's his</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

109
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

110
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>well here's the deal and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake Maiello made.</v>

111
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>You have to acknowledge that what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about is fucked up and horrible</v>

112
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just so happen to have not had a</v>

113
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:27.601
<v Speaker 1>bad experience within those parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say you were raped as a woman and</v>

114
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

115
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way happens for some</v>

116
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're one of those women in,</v>

117
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you're about to say that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that we're going into a very</v>

118
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>dangerous place right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't say,</v>

119
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rapes are absolutely fabulous,</v>

120
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>and women have come from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to say,</v>

121
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rape is evil.</v>

122
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.150
<v Speaker 1>But I buy some weird freak of nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually liked,</v>

123
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>or a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's times when you murdered</v>

124
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>a guy and he ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a mass murder and it was a good</v>

125
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

126
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.951
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

127
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm describing a murder.</v>

128
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not condoning murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in this weird case it worked.</v>

129
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And Milo's mistake was he said it worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

130
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>And then he implied that it could work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a ton of other gays to be fucked at</v>

131
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he did that,</v>

132
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunken peasants podcast and his take on</v>

133
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>it from the drunken peasants was</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than his take on it from mine.</v>

134
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And on my podcast it seemed more like he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to make light of something</v>

135
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>that most likely definitely did happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>

136
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>The father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael.</v>

137
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two,</v>

138
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>there's the father Michael thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if I believe that.</v>

139
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him say that joke a few times</v>

140
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never would've given such good head</v>

141
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.270
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for Father Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

142
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>So you think that might be something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that he's constructed?</v>

143
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

144
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 1>That's just my gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing was condoning</v>

145
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>sexual relationships with 13 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

146
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>especially in the gay world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I know of straight guys who were a</v>

147
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>strict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of in particular who was</v>

148
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 1>molested at camp and it was by an older</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay camp counselor.</v>

149
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>This guy thinks of that guy every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls them on Linkedin,</v>

150
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>hoping he'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to murder him.</v>

151
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the problem with what Milo said is</v>

152
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you end up normalizing this behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it's okay if in the gay world,</v>

153
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some older gay who's at Camp Goes,</v>

154
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is probably a fag that I'm blowing.</v>

155
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

156
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So what I say to these gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these 13 year old gates to go,</v>

158
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I would be okay with fucking a 29 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

159
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.261
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

160
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not normalizing that because</v>

161
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>the vast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of times it doesn't turn</v>

162
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>out well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So No.</v>

163
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of putting it,</v>

164
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

165
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.000
<v Speaker 1>it's really disturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>

166
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>The Milo thing is so odd because first</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

167
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:42.011
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got this act and let's call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it an act cause part of it has got to be</v>

168
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>an act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a wide spectrum of his</v>

169
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on Bill Maher he can be a raging</v>

170
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>liberace queen with pearls on dress like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman.</v>

171
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean just like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Camper than any woman I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And then for the apology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the conservative with the coke</v>

174
00:07:57.771 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>bottle glasses.</v>

175
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sorta like when a Jamaican goes</v>

176
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>back to Jamaica and they start speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Patois,</v>

177
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>like their grandmother and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily lying.</v>

178
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just a wide range of use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He plays it up and there it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a performance piece</v>

180
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.030
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

181
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>what's really interesting is he's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at riling people up.</v>

182
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously very good at getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people upset and,</v>

183
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's created these sort of false</v>

184
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>narratives about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's a Nazi,</v>

185
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that he promotes genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

186
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>there was so many people outside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley thing that were screaming,</v>

187
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:39.281
<v Speaker 1>calling them a Nazi and saying he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascist when they in fact were behaving</v>

188
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>in very authoritarian fascist ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Antifa by the way,</v>

189
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Antifa is.</v>

190
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:50.100
<v Speaker 1>That's those guys antifascist is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Antifa stands for?</v>

191
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're terrorists and they use terror.</v>

192
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>They use violence to achieve political</v>
<v Speaker 1>gains,</v>

193
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:59.741
<v Speaker 1>which terrorism and these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Milo ever set or trump</v>

194
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>even ever said anything that is remotely</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to genocide,</v>

195
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>but those guys just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that wants to enforce immigration</v>

196
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>laws is a fucking Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need violence cause I'm trying to</v>

197
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 1>stop Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm around the first stages of Hitler,</v>

198
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going back in time and strangling</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in his crib.</v>

199
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

200
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the way they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to it is the absolute wrong way</v>

201
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>to react to someone who sang something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't agree with.</v>

202
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the right way is to say something</v>

203
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>that you feel opposes what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and makes more sense to debate</v>

204
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beauty of free speech,</v>

205
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>like w it has no limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get out there and deny</v>

206
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get out there and sexualized</v>

207
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>toddlers all go to your talk.</v>

208
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in the q and a,</v>

209
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not,</v>

210
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he even should just be a q</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a.</v>

211
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it should be real clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>other there.</v>

212
00:09:53.351 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>There should be someone and we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just rely on the audience to come up</v>

213
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 1>with some sort of a response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to have someone</v>

214
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>as controversial as Milo and you are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to it that you're willing to</v>

215
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>throw bricks through starbucks windows</v>
<v Speaker 1>and light cop cars on fire,</v>

216
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 1>there should be someone that can speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your side and then you should</v>

217
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>organize some sort of a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is setting it up the wrong way</v>

218
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Speaker 1>because you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone said to me once,</v>

219
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.751
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls,</v>

221
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd fucking kick everybody's ass.</v>

222
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.053
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>

223
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>

224
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't because you'd have</v>

225
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.870
<v Speaker 1>discipline and you'd realize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that.</v>

226
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>But second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you just kick someone's ass,</v>

227
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just take it like they come</v>

228
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:35.390
<v Speaker 1>back with a bat or a gun or their</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

229
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:37.770
<v Speaker 1>he started fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get it back and it goes</v>

230
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>back and forth and back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all conflict pretty much goes that</v>

231
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have conflict and then someone</v>

232
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 1>responds to that conflict and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>escalates.</v>

233
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you have this thing where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start throwing bricks through windows</v>

234
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 1>and light and cop cars on fire in</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping people from talking and hitting</v>

235
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>people that have a make bitcoin great</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

236
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>hats and just see that girl got maced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face by a 60 year olds.</v>

237
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Eventually people show up with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

238
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens when you keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>escalating the violence.</v>

239
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You become a them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become the other,</v>

240
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.480
<v Speaker 1>you become the enemy and you create this</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarizing atmosphere that's so intense</v>

241
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.940
<v Speaker 1>that no dialogue's kind of fix it now</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're the enemy.</v>

242
00:11:18.941 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the north versus</v>

243
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

244
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Protestants versus the Catholics,</v>

246
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:24.541
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

247
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:29.541
<v Speaker 1>you create this horrific environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>where almost it's almost impossible to</v>

248
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 1>avoid violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

249
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>so I'm done avoiding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the low road.</v>

250
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm punching them in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you're doing with this</v>

251
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>outfit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

252
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.850
<v Speaker 1>That is really what I'm doing with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>outfit.</v>

253
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I did a talk at Nyu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pepper sprayed me.</v>

254
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Did they re when was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a couple of weeks ago.</v>

255
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it talk about?</v>

256
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know me as pro trump or something</v>

257
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:51.661
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

258
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Nazi because of that.</v>

259
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>They sh they don't want to give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform to free speech.</v>

260
00:11:55.901 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the irony of all this is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that it's gotten so far.</v>

261
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:05.521
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond debate now in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are recruiting fascists for some sort</v>

262
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>of imminent genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're like signing up the brown</v>

263
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:13.741
<v Speaker 1>shirts with a form at our talks and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go say that was possible.</v>

264
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>

265
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Like we sign you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're part of the club.</v>

266
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Then you come with us on the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>

267
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 1>The fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't played it through in your</v>

268
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>mind because for these people it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

269
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why they don't want to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a born again.</v>

270
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to debate about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of God.</v>

271
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 1>He's already on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was your plan when you went</v>

272
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:35.051
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>

273
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>what did you want to talk?</v>

274
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 1>this Nazi that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

276
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 1>that you've made Milo and I out to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants genocide and who,</v>

277
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees nonwhites is inhuman,</v>

278
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.691
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

279
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:46.931
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

280
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:48.070
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>

281
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

282
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

283
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>that guy should be allowed to talk if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>

284
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your monster is a mythical beast and</v>

285
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you've gone to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 60 grand in debt already to fight</v>

286
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>this mythical beast who doesn't fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist?</v>

287
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of Milo,</v>

288
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 1>he definitely doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo is not a Nazi.</v>

289
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not promoting genocide.</v>

290
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And those are two things that just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>trumpeted about left and right.</v>

291
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Exactly who is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Milo has said some very inflammatory</v>

292
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:23.071
<v Speaker 1>things about and in a very generalizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>way about women and about the wage gap</v>

293
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:29.191
<v Speaker 1>and about all sorts of things that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>designs his words and his phrases to be</v>

294
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory.</v>

295
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So he gets the most response and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been incredibly profitable.</v>

296
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean up into Harper Collins pulled his</v>
<v Speaker 1>book deal.</v>

297
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 1>He had a $250,000 book advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His book was number one on Amazon.</v>

298
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Just sheerly through controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

299
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean through presales and controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strategy and a lot of ways and</v>

300
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:54.061
<v Speaker 1>it's also a response to this really hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>stance that the far left is taking this</v>

301
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>anti anti free speech stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

302
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 1>But always with these cases you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly did he say?</v>

303
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I always say this to people who bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and I told her,</v>

304
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sentence in what book is factually</v>

305
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.870
<v Speaker 1>incorrect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What specifically are you saying?</v>

306
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And with this Milo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that often sexual relationships</v>

307
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 1>with 13 year olds can be beneficial for</v>
<v Speaker 1>gays.</v>

308
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has since retracted that and</v>

309
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:20.980
<v Speaker 1>apologized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not enough.</v>

310
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's about as as egregious as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets.</v>

311
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 1>The other stuff that he says we all say</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a joking way and then that becomes</v>

312
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>pure evil and you advocate for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

313
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So the left is willfully ignorant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor when it comes to Milo and with</v>

314
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:38.590
<v Speaker 1>trump too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the grab the pussy thing,</v>

315
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>which they had a whole fucking parade</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and they still wear these dumb</v>

316
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:45.750
<v Speaker 1>wool hats to look like a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a joke you said on a bus,</v>

317
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing a dumb joke on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

318
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that he doesn't want to have a</v>

319
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>new policy called the pussy grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>statute,</v>

320
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but they are willfully hiding their</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor so they can take things</v>

321
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.830
<v Speaker 1>literally and go off on a tirade of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

322
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I think they're shocked that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fed our entire life po politicians that</v>

323
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 1>speak in a statesmen Lee like way a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>predetermined,</v>

324
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>planned out way where they have pauses</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their speech like Obama,</v>

325
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.080
<v Speaker 1>when he speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has some very non normal patterns to</v>

326
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:21.914
<v Speaker 1>his behavior.</v>

327
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those,</v>

328
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 1>those things that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The showmanship of being a president,</v>

329
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 1>that it's all designed to comfort you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have you think that this person is</v>

330
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>clearly different than anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

331
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.540
<v Speaker 1>they talk different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have better speaks president</v>

332
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have better speaks.</v>

333
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:38.801
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

334
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:40.190
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're statesmen like,</v>

335
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

336
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Speaker 1>they speak in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

337
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.080
<v Speaker 1>preplanned out sentences that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate and,</v>

338
00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cleanly worded.</v>

339
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's not what you get with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that disturbs the shit out of</v>

340
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just serves it.</v>

341
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw so many people going off the other</v>

342
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 1>day about his talk about uranium and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton's selling uranium.</v>

343
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it's things and you,</v>

344
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it's for things very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like he's running out of words.</v>

345
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know what the words are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

346
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are pointing to it like it's</v>

347
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 1>this horrible moment where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

348
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 1>essentially all he did was run out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>words and just the fucking guys probably</v>

349
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 1>working 16 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably exhausted.</v>

350
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming stress of the job for</v>

351
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:25.790
<v Speaker 1>any one of them is almost immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent once they get into office.</v>

352
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing it with trump as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing like,</v>

353
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.430
<v Speaker 1>like that unhinged press conference that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made guarantee you.</v>

354
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Some of that has to do with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy has worn the fuck out.</v>

355
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a 70 year old man,</v>

356
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 1>like I'm almost 50 and I'm fucking tired</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

357
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.320
<v Speaker 1>How's this guy who's 20 years older than</v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

358
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Can I deal with the stress of running</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest economy,</v>

359
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:51.251
<v Speaker 1>the biggest military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most insane country the world has</v>

360
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:53.240
<v Speaker 1>ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

361
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what the United States is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

362
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 1>They say Maggie Thatcher slept four</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a night,</v>

363
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 1>four hours a night repeatedly starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>chip away at your psyche.</v>

364
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing I would say about trump</v>

365
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:05.120
<v Speaker 1>when they say he's not presidential is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried that,</v>

366
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I tried it with Romney.</v>

367
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.060
<v Speaker 1>You got mad at his binder comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

368
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I tried it with cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitutional superman and who</v>

369
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>could debate anyone and was area died</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and presidential.</v>

370
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.601
<v Speaker 1>And you went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

371
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 1>he's ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

372
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing in Rodney dangerfield from</v>

373
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 1>caddyshack and he's just going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrecking ball.</v>

374
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 1>And when Huffington Post says we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting trump in the entertainment</v>

375
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said of the new section,</v>

376
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Romney and cruise wouldn't have said</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

377
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Trump says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ann coulter points this out in your</v>

378
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:32.901
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In trump,</v>

379
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:34.680
<v Speaker 1>we trust jump goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Arianna Huffington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't your husband leave you for a man?</v>

381
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he made the right choice.</v>

382
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a very good choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go that you,</v>

383
00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you brought this on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made me have to get him.</v>

384
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she's doing,</v>

385
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within culture is doing is very similar</v>

386
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 1>to what Milo's doing.</v>

387
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>You mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are merchants of outrage and</v>

388
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

389
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I think they're speaking in a hyperbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>tone.</v>

390
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>They're flamboyant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the charter was still</v>

391
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

392
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some truth,</v>

393
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 1>especially with Milo that some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he says,</v>

394
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all truth.</v>

395
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:08.071
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

396
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it right now.</v>

397
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he say this factually</v>

398
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 1>incorrect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

399
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

400
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>not factually incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but extremely offensive to people like</v>

401
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.270
<v Speaker 1>the 13 year old boy comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing about sort of normalizing</v>

402
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 1>relationships between grown men and 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old boys.</v>

403
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.151
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

404
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I think a big part of why he even says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because he's in many ways like a</v>

405
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:36.891
<v Speaker 1>natural contrarian and in many ways a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who wants to get a rise out of</v>

406
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by saying that he didn't feel like</v>

407
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 1>there's any consequences to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous in that regard.</v>

408
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 1>But I think we could both agree whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not it's factual.</v>

409
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:47.400
<v Speaker 1>In his case</v>

410
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucked up thing to say right at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucked up thing to say it was</v>

411
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.690
<v Speaker 2>negligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I apologize.</v>

412
00:18:52.691 --> 00:18:57.160
<v Speaker 2>But I think the grain of truth to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with his other statements is a lot</v>

413
00:18:57.161 --> 00:18:59.680
<v Speaker 2>more than a grain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the grain of truth to what he was</v>

414
00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:02.620
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his gaze have less chastity than</v>

415
00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:05.230
<v Speaker 2>straights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if a woman is known as a slut,</v>

416
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.590
<v Speaker 2>she's less likely to be picked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been sued for calling woman a</v>

417
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:09.610
<v Speaker 2>slut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you really?</v>

418
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Sued you?</v>

419
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.270
<v Speaker 2>It was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back in vice days it was in do's and</v>

420
00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:14.560
<v Speaker 2>don'ts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

421
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.620
<v Speaker 2>the way the law is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of antiquated,</v>

422
00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:18.454
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

423
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.780
<v Speaker 2>you called her a slut now she won't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>currency in the market of marriage.</v>

424
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's known as a whore,</v>

425
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.550
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to punish you punitively</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this sin.</v>

426
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to settle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

427
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.290
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even call someone a slut.</v>

428
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no word for a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

429
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I cad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a compliment.</v>

430
00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

431
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.080
<v Speaker 2>A cat is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

432
00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:43.750
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's no equivalent for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man shows you that there's a different</v>

433
00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:47.050
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with gays it is different to</v>

434
00:19:47.051 --> 00:19:50.380
<v Speaker 2>like 13 year old and an older person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

435
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.720
<v Speaker 2>If it's a girl and a 40 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher,</v>

436
00:19:52.721 --> 00:19:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I want to take him to the parking lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat him till he's has a weird,</v>

437
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.470
<v Speaker 2>he walks weird for the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a woman in a boy,</v>

438
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to murder her.</v>

439
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm grossed out 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially 14 little better.</v>

440
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.430
<v Speaker 2>And then with gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

441
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.130
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not gonna make the same mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo made right now.</v>

442
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if a guy's known as a slut in the</v>

443
00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:18.640
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say a 19 year old fucks,</v>

444
00:20:18.641 --> 00:20:22.810
<v Speaker 2>200 people as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one wants to go near as a gay.</v>

445
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.460
<v Speaker 2>You've been around the block.</v>

446
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

447
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:27.540
<v Speaker 1>this is not the same consequences for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

448
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bit of my act about,</v>

449
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember this</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial,</v>

450
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but there was a commercial adjust for</v>
<v Speaker 1>men commercial where there was a baby</v>

451
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>that was driving a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a baby with a beard and there was a</v>

452
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>grown woman next to the baby and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby has like a Tuxedo on and it's like</v>

453
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you've always wanted the biggest bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his beard and the baby goes to the</v>

454
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:49.190
<v Speaker 1>nightclub and a bouncer looks at him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>winks.</v>

455
00:20:49.191 --> 00:20:49.991
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

457
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the baby walks in just for men.</v>

458
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what the fuck just for men,</v>

459
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know it is some stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys put in their beard when they're</v>

460
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:01.390
<v Speaker 1>getting old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this baby's got a bottle,</v>

461
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 1>he goes out to the dance.</v>

462
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>For this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these girls with these tiny little</v>

463
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:09.961
<v Speaker 1>skirts dancing around him and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a pimp and he's with this hot</v>

464
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this to me,</v>

465
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 1>my bit was this is proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive proof,</v>

466
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sexual equality when it comes</v>

467
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:20.500
<v Speaker 1>to child molesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you even wrote that down with</v>

468
00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>the sexist reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wrote it down,</v>

469
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

470
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a little baby girl and she goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to a room full of guys who are</v>

471
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 1>wearing Tarzan skirts and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging dicks around her and she's got</v>

472
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:35.770
<v Speaker 1>a bottle and they're all fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>her attention and kissing her on the</v>

473
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would go to fucking jail.</v>

474
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 1>But that was a commercial that aired on</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream television.</v>

475
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:43.330
<v Speaker 1>No one cared about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That commercial aired for years.</v>

476
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It's probably still on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that commercial is proof positive</v>

477
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 1>that we have a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude towards a grown woman who's hot</v>

478
00:21:51.461 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 1>as fuck and a little baby.</v>

479
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well even I was watching big with the</v>

480
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:58.180
<v Speaker 1>kids the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hanks is what?</v>

481
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Eight in that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine and then that woman's seduces him</v>

482
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 1>and I guess he fucks her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets a boner and I'm like,</v>

483
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you're raping a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

484
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Why are we watching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's hot.</v>

485
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 1>She's hot and he looks like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just let it ride.</v>

486
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>If that movie was reversed and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young girl that all of a sudden was in a</v>

487
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 1>sexual woman's body and the guy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking her,</v>

488
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

489
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Are we supposed to be doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be horrified.</v>

490
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You would be absolutely horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been arguing about cause of the</v>

491
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Milo thing when arguing about all this a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and I've been getting from gays and</v>

492
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 1>guides with kids that are young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

493
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing about how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep saying,</v>

494
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't lie.</v>

495
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You would definitely want to fuck a 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old girl if she was hot.</v>

496
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.110
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where this became a normal</v>

497
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked 17 year olds when I was 17 it</v>

498
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:47.650
<v Speaker 1>was the worst sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

499
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be on top of her and is out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even know when it was in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cause I'll come if I look at this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>circles.</v>

514
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've experienced.</v>

515
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 1>When I want to play tennis with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>toddler.</v>

516
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to play tennis with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can return a serve.</v>

517
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

518
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

520
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never been attracted to a 15 year</v>

521
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 1>old girl like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't get that.</v>

522
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 1>But I know I was molested by a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 13 years old.</v>

523
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was 13 years old,</v>

524
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.230
<v Speaker 1>there was a woman that we used to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>softball with on our block and</v>

525
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 1>apparently she did it to a lot of boys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she took me up to her room.</v>

526
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>She played me some really good music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She introduced me to a lot of led</v>

527
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Zeppelin.</v>

528
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.190
<v Speaker 1>She introduced me to comfortably numb</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd this day.</v>

529
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 1>When I think about that song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about making out with her,</v>

530
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but she was 21 and I was 13 she just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kissed you?</v>

531
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she grabbed my dick but I was just so</v>

532
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>little fuck I was doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

533
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I was so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 13.</v>

534
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like a little boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 1>if she had caught me like a year or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

536
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have fucked her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that at that stage I was baffled</v>

537
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>because I had like zero sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

538
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 21 year old woman with tetes of smoked</v>

539
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes and she was making out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and taking me up to a room is really</v>

540
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had a boyfriend and her</v>

541
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:43.340
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend was a construction worker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a man.</v>

542
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing him like on the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has his shirt off and had a hairy</v>

543
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>

544
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

545
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And that was her boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was just a wild woman.</v>

546
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And she uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently like taking young boys that</v>

547
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what they're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking them up to her room.</v>

548
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why we have judges cause there's</v>

549
00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 1>different cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different genders,</v>

550
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:06.230
<v Speaker 1>different circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I talked to a black guy about</v>

551
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:08.750
<v Speaker 1>their first sexual experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hair is whitened.</v>

552
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>

553
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucked my cousin when I was 12</v>

554
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 1>like Chris cotton was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking his cousin was Chris Cotton,</v>

555
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>comedian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark as a piece of coal,</v>

556
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked his cousin's Shirad small fucked</v>

00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 1>his babysitter when he was like 11 or 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories before.</v>

558
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the babysitter story before</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>

559
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 13 she's 18 and next thing you</v>

560
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 1>know you're making out with her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ollie,</v>

561
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 1>she's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but should she go to jail for 15 years?</v>

562
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>

563
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference between an</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight year old,</v>

564
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:47.450
<v Speaker 1>18 year old boy rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an 18 year old girl and a 13 year</v>

565
00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 1>old girl and a 13 year old boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a just a big goddamn difference</v>

566
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're a grown woman and a 13 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old boy.</v>

567
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

568
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 1>here's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is like,</v>

569
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.270
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was one of the things that came up</v>

570
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 1>in the Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conversation to where he was saying</v>

571
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:05.720
<v Speaker 1>that it's not that big a deal if a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs a woman's tit and she doesn't want</v>

572
00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:06.291
<v Speaker 1>them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

573
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:07.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sexual assault.</v>

574
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 1>If a woman grabs my dick and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want her to,</v>

575
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 1>that might be sexual assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not in danger.</v>

576
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like she's not going to fuck me up.</v>

577
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 1>She's not going to rape me.</v>

578
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's where it gets different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not scared.</v>

579
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Like if a woman came over and grabbed my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass like that,</v>

580
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>you probably shouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not scared of you.</v>

581
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.571
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

582
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if a man does that to a woman and</v>

583
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:31.070
<v Speaker 1>he's willing to violate our space like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

584
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>a woman has a real fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a possibility what the,</v>

585
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the door might be open it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy could rape her.</v>

586
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this all comes down to the myth of</v>

587
00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:43.190
<v Speaker 1>equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why the right is more,</v>

588
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 1>has a more benevolent society than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

589
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've noticed this with girls.</v>

590
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I've always said you can hit a woman if</v>
<v Speaker 1>she hits you 12 times,</v>

591
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that includes punches in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just sit there going,</v>

592
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

593
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 and then 11 12th and then one I can't</v>

594
00:26:58.741 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 1>even hit one.</v>

595
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 1>If they hit me 12 I'd have to arm drag</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

596
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 1>take her back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choker,</v>

597
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>you could choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A crazy woman is trying to kill you,</v>

598
00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but you can't punch 12 I would only do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it if I thought they were hurting</v>

599
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:11.470
<v Speaker 1>someone in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

600
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to a feminist and liberals</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

601
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>they go 12 one and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

602
00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

603
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're stronger than you,</v>

604
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to admit that.</v>

605
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't to admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with gays and it's the</v>

606
00:27:21.201 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>same like I was writing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that documentary dog fight</v>

607
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:29.620
<v Speaker 1>dwg and I'm looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Kimbo slice is in that and I'm,</v>

608
00:27:29.621 --> 00:27:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm done on two dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 5,000 a 5,000 and a I'm looking at it</v>

609
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys were murdering each other on</v>

610
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:38.160
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You figured out a way to solve it with</v>

611
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard fighting.</v>

612
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:45.530
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have the same enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 1>as rich white kids doing it in the</v>

613
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 1>suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least that's what your instincts</v>

614
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 1>are when you see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't make sense.</v>

615
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>The laws should be equitable across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>

616
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a different situation.</v>

617
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 1>They're in a shitty situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're murdering each other,</v>

618
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 1>these backyard fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure someone loses an eye,</v>

619
00:27:58.771 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 1>but they're not murdering each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

620
00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:02.040
<v Speaker 1>It's an improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

621
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to enforce this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it's done,</v>

622
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 1>but you feel like there should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

623
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:08.910
<v Speaker 1>lots of different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you say we're all exactly the</v>

624
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the next thing you know,</v>

625
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:15.561
<v Speaker 1>women are getting punched one on one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as strong as men.</v>

626
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So they're getting fucking beating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're telling women they're</v>

627
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 1>invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going out and getting shit faced</v>

628
00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:21.240
<v Speaker 1>like you and I do.</v>

629
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

630
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Lamborghini.</v>

631
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't get wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your delicate,</v>

632
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking cheap old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>57 Chevy beat me up.</v>

633
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.423
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

634
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

635
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.550
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a narrative,</v>

636
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not people are aware of it,</v>

637
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but there is something that is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>being thrown around as being a viable</v>

638
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:45.780
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is that there's no biological</v>

639
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:50.781
<v Speaker 1>difference between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no biological difference between</v>

640
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 1>the sexes and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see people say it,</v>

641
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it,</v>

642
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:57.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a debate that Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

643
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the PR,</v>

644
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the people that he was debating was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor from the University of Toronto</v>

645
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 1>and it was a gender equality professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something along that,</v>

646
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:13.551
<v Speaker 1>some bizarre discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was a transgender man.</v>

647
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Like she was born a woman and then she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man or maybe,</v>

648
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

649
00:29:17.801 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's,</v>

650
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it anyway,</v>

651
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a very feminine man.</v>

652
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like a woman that became a</v>

653
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:27.930
<v Speaker 1>man and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

654
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:30.650
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whichever how Z,</v>

655
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>

656
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.250
<v Speaker 1>z.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

657
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 1>and literally arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that this is going to be</v>

658
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 1>broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing this is going to be on</v>

659
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>

660
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.500
<v Speaker 1>saying that there's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no biological basis.</v>

661
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

662
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between men and</v>

663
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:53.500
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely insane.</v>

664
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no women who come anywhere</v>

665
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 1>near what men power lifters can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't come anywhere near,</v>

666
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.490
<v Speaker 1>they might be stronger than you or I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might.</v>

667
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 1>They might cause they're doing it for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and had taken steroids,</v>

668
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 1>but even the women who take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no where near as strong as the</v>

669
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close.</v>

670
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no women who are in the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no women heavyweight boxing</v>

671
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:16.564
<v Speaker 1>champions.</v>

672
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to beat the men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

673
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:21.100
<v Speaker 1>there's an absolutely a biological basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sex.</v>

674
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I have trained extensively with women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts extensively.</v>

675
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 1>There is an enormous difference and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard they hit.</v>

676
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 1>There's an enormous difference in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong they are.</v>

677
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could beat them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of would fuck you up.</v>

678
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't beat Ronda Rousey,</v>

679
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:39.070
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I could beat up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>

680
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of feathers weighs,</v>

681
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>most of them would fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a technique thing.</v>

682
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if if you had trained as long as them,</v>

683
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 1>they would be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's a lot of factors</v>

684
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

685
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got in Shit for saying it because</v>

686
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 1>there was a man who transitioned to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman after 30 years of being a woman</v>

687
00:30:58.121 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 1>after fathering a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the military,</v>

688
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:02.560
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on living life as a man,</v>

689
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 1>became a woman for two years and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>started having mma fights with women and</v>

690
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:11.270
<v Speaker 1>not telling them that he was a woman for</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>

691
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.980
<v Speaker 1>She was a woman for 30 years and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a one.</v>

692
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

693
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And that the structure of the body's</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

694
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.630
<v Speaker 1>the hips are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The jaws different than the size of the</v>

695
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:23.050
<v Speaker 1>hands is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The size of the fist is an enormous</v>

696
00:31:23.051 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 1>difference between the hour that a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>can generate.</v>

697
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:28.570
<v Speaker 1>When I see that trainee pounding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>living shit out of a woman,</v>

698
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like domestic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disturbing.</v>

699
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:30.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

700
00:31:30.691 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it on the TV and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>liberals.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

703
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia.</v>

704
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It keeps making things worse and worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worse for them.</v>

705
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even abortion and immigration in</v>

00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:55.360
<v Speaker 1>to have boys than girls and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to have gender based abortions</v>

709
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 1>where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have a boy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That wasn't,</v>

719
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 1>they're going to become the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>retards.</v>

720
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they wanted it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

722
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted the right to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want someone to tell them,</v>

723
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 1>and particularly in the most extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>

724
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 1>like if a woman's raped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if a woman's raped and she gets</v>

725
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 1>pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should not have to keep that baby.</v>

726
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 1>They're taking right exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is the freaking second that I'm</v>

727
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>sick of freak exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Defining policies.</v>

728
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would you be,</v>

729
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 1>would you be fine with those freak</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions being law?</v>

730
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:45.621
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

731
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you're a pro life person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

732
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 1>That's your stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

733
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

734
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.890
<v Speaker 1>would you be pro choice of a woman was</v>
<v Speaker 1>raped?</v>

735
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

736
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean I'm not playing that</v>

737
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 1>game anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

738
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm not trying to play it in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

739
00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.301
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

740
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Other side of that is that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

741
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 1>they always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably,</v>

742
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 1>especially with journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be talking about sexism,</v>

743
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:06.441
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

744
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:06.981
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll go,</v>

745
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 1>what if your daughter was blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

746
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:09.884
<v Speaker 1>blah?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

747
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make me irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

748
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not accusing you of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like these liberals have these</v>

749
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 1>tricks where like what if a girl was</v>
<v Speaker 1>raped by her father and she got pregnant</v>

750
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and I looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could only find one case,</v>

751
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 1>one case in America of a father</v>
<v Speaker 1>impregnating a daughter.</v>

752
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And I thought this freak occurrence</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps defining the whole debate.</v>

753
00:33:30.421 --> 00:33:34.820
<v Speaker 1>We've got kermit Gosnell killing 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies that were in their third</v>

754
00:33:34.821 --> 00:33:38.500
<v Speaker 1>trimester yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one man is who's a,</v>

755
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

756
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested for performing a late</v>

757
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:47.530
<v Speaker 1>term abortion from abortions and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered that it was a,</v>

758
00:33:47.531 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 1>sorry 40,000 is my personal estimate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole country,</v>

759
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think he did hundreds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>

760
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Now I understand what you're saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get roped into any</v>

761
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 1>crazy sort of hypothetical scenario</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you say,</v>

762
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 1>what if it was your daughter and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>raped by some convict to just got to</v>

763
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

764
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't want to get into that,</v>

765
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain circumstances,</v>

766
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I really think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

767
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:13.754
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

768
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 1>a difference between someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant for three weeks and someone was</v>

769
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 1>pregnant for five months.</v>

770
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

771
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Like with the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get it,</v>

772
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 1>get it away from 17 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to get it down.</v>

773
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to get the whole argument down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks,</v>

774
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.670
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal.</v>

775
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

776
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I have friends in New York City where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has to think outside the box</v>

777
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 1>and they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

778
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 1>it's murder and I'm for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jim Goad says that all the time.</v>

779
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Kumina says that it's murder and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome.</v>

780
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because he doesn't want to be</v>

781
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:52.010
<v Speaker 1>responsible and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucks a lot of crazy girls.</v>

782
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 1>That's really the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

783
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been to super fortunate that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that I had babies with,</v>

784

<v Speaker 1>shit he got in recently.</v>

787
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.180
<v Speaker 1>We all told him to get the fuck away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from her and he kept walking back into</v>

788
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:16.181
<v Speaker 1>the client's fun and I would see him</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her and it was like a fucking rape</v>

789
00:35:16.461 --> 00:35:17.660

<v Speaker 1>he's also a wise man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

804
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 1>he has had this theory about psychotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and erotic until almost the,</v>

805
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 1>to basically almost that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interchangeable,</v>

806
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 1>that they sort of rotate on each of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

807
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And that when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've all had gals from the past,</v>

808
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 1>there were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

809
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll leave their apartment and go,</v>

810
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a shower.</v>

811
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I got to cool down jasmine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

812
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And then they start calling you later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

813
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>come over and fuck my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

814
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the crazy ones,</v>

815
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:12.340
<v Speaker 1>the ones who want you to take a teaspoon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scoop the come off their face so</v>

816
00:36:12.341 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 1>they can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is only going to happen once in</v>

817
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:16.930
<v Speaker 1>my entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we go.</v>

818
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And those girls exist and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really fun.</v>

819
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And when you're a guy and you're used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls that are like,</v>

820
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't come in my mouth.</v>

821
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't touch me there.</v>

822
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to.</v>

823
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You know there's like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people are so reserved and so</v>

824
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:36.471
<v Speaker 1>restricted and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so confined and then you date some crazy</v>

825
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 1>girl and she's just wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like put it in my ass.</v>

826
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

827
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.890
<v Speaker 1>where are we going with anthony?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was that and then some and already</v>

828
00:36:46.591 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 1>was like framing little kids who were at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>

829
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I think she got one of them got marker</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and or she,</v>

830
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 1>she put sparkles in his hair or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and the mother goes,</v>

831
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.800
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going on with your hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got that's going to take forever</v>

832
00:36:58.801 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>to get out.</v>

833
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was her and blamed some 10 year old,</v>

834
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:07.160
<v Speaker 1>no evils dark shit she had done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>

835
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's going too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do agree wholeheartedly.</v>

836
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.510
<v Speaker 1>And when my friends tell me they dumped</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bitch cause she's crazy,</v>

837
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I get mad at them because I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you crazy.</v>

838
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Pitches are the best sex you'll ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in your life.</v>

839
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 1>If she's not calling the cops then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking her.</v>

840
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 1>But that's what you're hypocritical</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

841
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the gun.</v>

842
00:37:25.161 --> 00:37:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the balance gets to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call the cops.</v>

843
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Sex should be right before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see the judge in the room</v>

844
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:34.150
<v Speaker 1>floating above your head with the gavel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

845
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

846
00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is a reality.</v>

847
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And here's another reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super uncomfortable reality.</v>

848
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to just get real clear about</v>

849
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:47.850
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

850
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:52.850
<v Speaker 1>This is in no way condoning any form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape or any form of sexual assault or</v>

851
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>any form of doing anything to anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male or female against their will.</v>

852
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:04.670
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are women who undeniably have rape</v>

853
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 1>fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

854
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Atwood talks about that and she</v>

855
00:38:09.991 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

856
00:38:11.251 --> 00:38:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but in our rape fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a guy with a ski mask who jumps</v>

857
00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 1>out of a Bush fat and ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Mr clean and he's cleaning our</v>

858
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 1>house and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

859
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to make love to you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

860
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:23.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no level of law.</v>

861
00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But that's her though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

862
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:28.020
<v Speaker 1>some women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a guy comes in with a gun and makes</v>

863
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 1>her suck his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

864
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a friend who that was her</v>

865
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:32.604
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all,</v>

866
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>everyone Louis C k does a bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

867
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>We've all had women where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

868
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:36.934
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

869
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you stop and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find it the next day.</v>

870
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:39.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

871
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You were supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

872
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Louie had the thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take a chance</v>

873
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.090
<v Speaker 1>to find out if it's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an email,</v>

874
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got an email from a girl that said</v>

875
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 1>thank you for raping me last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

876
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but that might be that like right up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls.</v>

877
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And I always say like that and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be joking around.</v>

878
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course she was.</v>

879
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 1>But that was her way of saying you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to the line.</v>

880
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 1>But I noticed this when I moved to New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York too.</v>

881
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to college in the 90s when it was</v>

882
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 1>about permission and feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried that.</v>

883
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.601
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

884
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:12.370
<v Speaker 1>is this okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this feminist?</v>

885
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:13.360
<v Speaker 1>And let's be clear about that.</v>

886
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 1>You are a feminist at one point your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

887
00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 1>would you define yourself as a feminist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still would.</v>

888
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:19.840
<v Speaker 1>In many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them as magical centi and beings.</v>

889
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 1>They're wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can make a fucking person come out</v>

890
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 1>of their current</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to say they're dudes is,</v>

891
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 1>is to trivialize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying to Clark Kent,</v>

892
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.570
<v Speaker 1>just be a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just focus on your journalism and Clark</v>

893
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Kent's a shitty journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a shitty man.</v>

894
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Does he have one store that he came in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his story I've ever,</v>

895
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 1>he's turned time backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

896
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's never broken a story,</v>

897
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 1>but we keep telling women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

898
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:42.071
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

899
00:39:42.071 --> 00:39:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Come to our meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come to where a tough mudder relay and</v>

<v Speaker 1>underneath.</v>

901
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So good at that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>your intestinal tract.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're going to get sick as fuck.</v>

911
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:11.230

<v Speaker 1>It seems like a weird beef to have.</v>

912

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough mudder or people to the puddles</v>

<v Speaker 1>drinking puddle water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know guys who have gotten</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you're out in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out in the mountains and like</v>

919
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:29.940
<v Speaker 1>they don't bring water with them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

920
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:32.380

<v Speaker 1>the water filter breaks or they put</v>

921
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 1>these a iodine tablets of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't wait long enough.</v>

922
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Then they drink it and you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>these live bacteria in your body and</v>

923
00:40:38.471 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 1>they wreck havoc with your system.</v>

928
00:40:47.051 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through trial and error,</v>

929
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.650
<v Speaker 1>there's that time that you're on 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're fucking girl from behind and</v>

<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those girls never made their way to me.</v>

948
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You fucked girls in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

950
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:34.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

951
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

952
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

953
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I just shied away from them or</v>

954
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some domestic violence in my house</v>

955
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Shit like that.</v>

956
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:47.031
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

957
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't naturally go.</v>

958
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:52.600
<v Speaker 1>There were sweeties I had one girl that</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked to get choked though it,</v>

959
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 1>but it always weirded me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

960
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 1>we're not that enthusiastic about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they want us to dress like</v>

961
00:41:57.471 --> 00:41:59.610
<v Speaker 1>clowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would put it on the little nose.</v>

962
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

963
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 1>You get into it after a while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize it's awesome,</v>

964
00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 1>but don't want to get choked by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how to choke you though.</v>

965
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 1>You want to get choked by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>ineffective,</v>

966
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.970
<v Speaker 1>like a sloppy choke where you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>still breathe.</v>

967
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was fucking this Jewish</v>

968
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 1>girl and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

969
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:15.710
<v Speaker 1>kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa cheese.</v>

970
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I didn't do that.</v>

971
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm your fucking whore at some coming on</v>

972
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:20.571
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

973
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm your dirty whore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she's having a cigarette after</v>

974
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:24.850
<v Speaker 1>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought your whore.</v>

975
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.770
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

976
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought the Liberals now are</v>

977
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 1>ruining that whole role playing fun game</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all play.</v>

978
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And sex is a nebulous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like religion,</v>

979
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it's personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's private.</v>

980
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird area where you do weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

981
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 1>You say stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to lick your cock because</v>

982
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to suck my cock and want to</v>

983
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 1>lick your pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're so horny.</v>

984
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:49.281
<v Speaker 1>You're brain goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

985
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to lick your balls when you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>my balls.</v>

986
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.603
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

987
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dirty talk is so awkward.</v>

988
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't do fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can do like so good.</v>

989
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven.</v>

990
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like when you're intimate</v>

991
00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 1>with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

992
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you're sharing that extremely vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

993
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

994
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's vulnerable nature because you don't</v>

995
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:21.020
<v Speaker 1>have your clothes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel weird.</v>

997
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always have our clothes on so we</v>

998
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 1>don't have our clothes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just odd,</v>

999
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.620
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like funny nude.</v>

1000
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're funny.</v>

1001
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:32.210
<v Speaker 1>You look funny and you're aroused and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels good and you're,</v>

1002
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 1>you want the other person to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel good to each other and it's</v>

1003
00:43:35.931 --> 00:43:37.640
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at each other's eyes and</v>

1004
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:38.960
<v Speaker 1>you're like that close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1005
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange and there's other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the issue that people</v>

1006
00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:46.670
<v Speaker 1>become very addicted to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings,</v>

1007
00:43:46.671 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 1>especially when having sex with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

1008
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a drug addiction.</v>

1009
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time is in a lot of</v>

1010
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>ways I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of,</v>

1011
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of endorphins that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being exchanged and there's a lot of</v>

1012
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.200
<v Speaker 1>arousal chemicals that are excluded when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with that person that are</v>

1013
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 1>extremely potent and when the person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not there,</v>

1014
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.530
<v Speaker 1>there's this deep need to get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1015
00:44:09.531 --> 00:44:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a drug,</v>

1016
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.163
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1017
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's got hooked on pain pills</v>

1018
00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 1>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get the pills.</v>

1019
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:17.660
<v Speaker 1>He got to get the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember,</v>

1020
00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in,</v>

1021
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend broke up with me and I had</v>

1022
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 1>just graduated from high school and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really lost and confused.</v>

1023
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And when she broke up with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was devastated.</v>

1024
00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe I had to be without</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1025
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was very much like withdrawal</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a drug.</v>

1026
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like probably the worst breakup</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me ever because it was the first</v>

1027
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:37.711
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1028
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>

1029
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just was amazed at like how</v>

1030
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.450
<v Speaker 1>potent it was on my system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and how it would fuck with my psyche and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind.</v>

1032
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like if this girl didn't want me,</v>

1033
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 1>like I must be a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be a failure.</v>

1034
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all had that.</v>

1035
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's where you learn never to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable again.</v>

1036
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 1>And you learn to be a man sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also learn to me,</v>

1037
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been fascinated by</v>

1038
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 1>psychology and fascinated by the inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>workings of the mind and the tricks the</v>

1039
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>mind plays on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause all throughout high school,</v>

1040
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.520
<v Speaker 1>from age 15 on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was competing in martial arts</v>

1041
00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:16.620
<v Speaker 1>tournaments and there were terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1042
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And so I was always scared and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go from,</v>

1043
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:19.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1044
00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to say that all y'all was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad motherfucker.</v>

1045
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't scared of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scared of fucking everything,</v>

1046
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:26.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was good cause I was</v>

1047
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 1>terrified and I was always training</v>
<v Speaker 1>super hard and I wouldn't drink it.</v>

1048
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

1049
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I smoked pot maybe a couple of times</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was fucking scared of getting</v>

1050
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scared of getting my ass kicked.</v>

1051
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So when this happened and this girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke up with me,</v>

1052
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it was so doug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just devastating to my,</v>

1053
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.410
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my confidence.</v>

1054
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1055
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:51.780
<v Speaker 1>why do I feel like such a fucking loser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then breaking it down and try to</v>

1056
00:45:51.781 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 1>figure like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was I a winner just like a few</v>

1057
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 1>months ago and now I'm a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in my mind,</v>

1058
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a fucking loser and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get laid.</v>

1059
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Girls that smelled desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they run from me like Ah,</v>

1060
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 18 year old girls.</v>

1061
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 1>When you're desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking,</v>

1062
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 1>they smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stink like a sewer and they run from</v>

1063
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My couldn't get laid for like six</v>

1064
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even get close.</v>

1065
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1066
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you played yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were vulnerable.</v>

1067
00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 1>You learned to never do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think adult men,</v>

1068
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 1>especially married men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to understand that you're</v>

1069
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 1>constantly in high school when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

1070
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not Dale Aiken when I was eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

1071
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.931
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1072
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:30.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just go up to your wife and go,</v>

1073
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.790
<v Speaker 1>let me see your tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does she has to show you her tits right</v>

1074
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:33.360
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1075
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I cannot fucking wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing him,</v>

1076
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to put my face in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina and just go blow.</v>

1077
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that if I want it to my</v>

1078
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 1>wife and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me a tip sheet.</v>

1079
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Say Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're constantly wooing them</v>

1080
00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 1>according to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had a buddy who got divorced</v>

1081
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 1>recently and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found myself having to draw lines</v>

1082
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 1>in the sand and make these parameters</v>
<v Speaker 1>around how it can be treated and how it</v>

1083
00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 1>can be spoken to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1084
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I've never had to do that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have to do that.</v>

1085
00:46:57.631 --> 00:46:58.411
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1086
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:00.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what marriage is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly on a date.</v>

1087
00:47:00.871 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I was on a date with my wife last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1088
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.150
<v Speaker 1>we got a hotel in the city or my kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>are staying with their grant.</v>

1089
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here on vacation in Malibu.</v>

1090
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was constantly going,</v>

1091
00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:12.390
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted her to have a good night.</v>

1092
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:15.300
<v Speaker 1>She wants to get Tacos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I have to draw the line and</v>

1093
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:15.571
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1094
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 1>actually we're going here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to the comedy store,</v>

1095
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 1>we're going to meet Don Barris and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>upstairs and blah blah.</v>

1096
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So I was giving her some democracy but</v>
<v Speaker 1>also taking the reigns and it's a push</v>

1097
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and pull that we've been married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've known each other since 2001 but</v>

1098
00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly like first day trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in her pants,</v>

1099
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 1>watch the real housewives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to care about that.</v>

1100
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Chico was Pinot Grigio all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get pussy.</v>

1101
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not guaranteed the pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1102
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 1>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a very strange relationship and</v>

1103
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 1>you probably not going to be satisfied</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it because that's part of what's</v>

1104
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:50.920
<v Speaker 1>going on in a relationship is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wooing is also like kind of that wooing</v>

1105
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and courting and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1106
00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being nice to each other.</v>

1107
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to like how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing works.</v>

1108
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what attracts like we were,</v>

1109
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 1>we were in Costa Rica on those stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>sands of flights that are one engine.</v>

1110
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.750
<v Speaker 1>So if it goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dying and the turbulence was</v>

1111
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:05.584
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

1112
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And so she's gripping me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

1113
00:48:07.571 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a bus in the sky.</v>

1114
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I am shitting my pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my heart is pounding through my chest</v>

1115
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and I'm holding her rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining to her what is going on.</v>

1116
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:17.290
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm looking at the window</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1117
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fucking die.</v>

1118
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:19.480
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1119
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And I still married to her for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got kids.</v>

1120
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I have to convey this man in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep her pussy wet.</v>

1121
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with sons</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>

1122
00:48:29.891 --> 00:48:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but kids in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so much of being a dad is being a</v>

1123
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:35.830
<v Speaker 1>prison warden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even after bedtime,</v>

1124
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you're walking down the hallways to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>if lights are on.</v>

1125
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 1>The other day I go into my son's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my middle son's room,</v>

1126
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I touch the light bulb is reading light</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can feel it's warm.</v>

1127
00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in here?</v>

1128
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.400

00:49:32.441 --> 00:49:34.480
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember wanting to get one of those</v>

1147
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 1>aerial sort of in tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are dangerous.</v>

1148
00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Those cops told me I'm not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that.</v>

1149
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 1>You can have a leather man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could buy those.</v>

1150
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not allowed to have it on</v>

1151
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leatherman and pepper spray or Anna</v>

1152
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.670

<v Speaker 1>You can have,</v>

1153
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.850
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So You concealed carry,</v>

1154
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 1>meaning walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to have one of those,</v>

1155
00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but you're allowed to have a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have a knife if it's a utility</v>

1156
00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 1>knife and it's smaller than the palm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand.</v>

1157
00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about New York rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1158
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And then at Nyu I was going to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

1159
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I got pepper sprayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly legal if they can argue that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was pepper sprayed you and did you</v>

1161
00:50:05.321 --> 00:50:07.120
<v Speaker 1>see the person doing it and do you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they are?</v>

1162
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 1>They are all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all middleclass,</v>

1163
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.060

<v Speaker 1>They all look exactly the same.</v>

1165
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 1>They look British.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>British?</v>

<v Speaker 1>they all look exactly the same.</v>

1169
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Nothing Italian about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what was it that they pepper sprayed</v>

1181
00:50:54.241 --> 00:50:55.090
<v Speaker 2>the meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1182
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 2>and we have different degrees like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>knights of Columbus first degree,</v>

1183
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 2>you declare yourself a proud boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second degree.</v>

1184
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 2>We'd beat the shit out of you until you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can name five breakfast cereals and you</v>

1185
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:06.020
<v Speaker 2>have to give him masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then third degree,</v>

1186
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 2>you still have to give up masturbating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to get a tattoo and then</v>

1187
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 2>fourth degree you get arrested or in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious violent fight for the grills.</v>

1188
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get arrested in a serious violent</v>

1189
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're promoted by some sort of major</v>

1190
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 2>altercation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't erase that part.</v>

1191
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Well we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't encourage it.</v>

1192
00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:27.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you're defending is like at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Berkeley thing with Milo,</v>

1193
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the my guys just 14 of them just walked</v>

1194
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 2>into a mob of 200 people just to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>their stripes.</v>

1195
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Said I thought you guys were tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No they were doing it just for fun and</v>

1196
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:40.370
<v Speaker 2>these people outside of pepper spray and</v>
<v Speaker 2>clubs,</v>

1197
00:51:40.371 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 2>they can't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at the Nyu thing,</v>

1198
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:44.240
<v Speaker 2>my guys were beating them up and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1199
00:51:44.241 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 2>this one guy we call friar tuck cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a monster.</v>

1200
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.740
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started feeling bad in it.</v>

1201
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I started feeling bad after a while</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I was just,</v>

1202
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I could tell these kids had never been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fight and I was just mowing through</v>

1203
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.193
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1204
00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 2>They're terrible fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're total proceeds fighting like</v>

1205
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:02.780
<v Speaker 2>this is what confuses me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why are they getting so angry that</v>

1206
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 2>they're hitting people and spraying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl in the face.</v>

1207
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:08.210
<v Speaker 2>The girl was really disturbing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was talking to someone and she</v>

1208
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 2>wasn't offering any threat and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a hat that looked like a make</v>

1209
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:15.620
<v Speaker 2>America great again hat but it said make</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin great again.</v>

1210
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 2>They walk up to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy hits her with a stick that's</v>

1211
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:21.110
<v Speaker 2>holding a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he hits her in the head with a piece</v>

1212
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:23.000
<v Speaker 2>of wood and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1213
00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:25.280
<v Speaker 2>And someone sprays her in the face with</v>
<v Speaker 2>pepper spray.</v>

1214
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like how in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you ever,</v>

1215
00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:34.841
<v Speaker 2>in any other scenario justify beating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman publicly for doing nothing but</v>

1216
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Speaker 2>representing what you think is offensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're even a wrong about what she's</v>

1217
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:42.944
<v Speaker 2>representing.</v>

1218
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem with what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1219
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 2>And I did this too much to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectualizing a fashion movement.</v>

1220
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:54.220
<v Speaker 2>This is the mods and the rockers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brighton Beach in 1961 just fighting</v>

1221
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 2>each other because one likes Elvis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other likes the WHO.</v>

1222
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>And if you were to sit down with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>mod in this rocker and say,</v>

1223
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.810
<v Speaker 2>have a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't say anything.</v>

1224
00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:05.750
<v Speaker 2>They have nothing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's leather versus park cause it's</v>

1225
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:09.140
<v Speaker 2>vespas worth versus triumph motorbikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no context there.</v>

1226
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.640
<v Speaker 2>So this guy is on this team and she's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other team and that their tool is</v>

1227
00:53:13.641 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 2>pepper spray and that's what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1228
00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:16.940
<v Speaker 2>There's no that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pretend,</v>

1229
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give you a platform.</v>

1230
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to give you in anything</v>

1231
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:22.460
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have anything to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1232
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>at the Nyu talk I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I watched the pepper sprayed,</v>

1233
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I went and did the talk.</v>

1234
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:27.340
<v Speaker 1>They're all screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1235
00:53:27.341 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 1>who's campus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our campus.</v>

1236
00:53:28.801 --> 00:53:32.990
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I walk over to the mob with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone and I have to and Oh,</v>

1237
00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:33.843
<v Speaker 1>come on up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on up.</v>

1238
00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And it was a radioactive cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was handing him like,</v>

1239
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:39.500
<v Speaker 1>he just went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well because then it was a mike.</v>

1240
00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 1>He shriveled up because he wanted to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of the big group.</v>

1241
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And didn't want to be an individual with</v>

1242
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 1>an opinion and didn't exactly know why</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there in the first place and</v>

1243
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 1>exactly know what he was protesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

1244
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That's why like Milo would kill to</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate any of these people.</v>

1245
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:55.560
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been scrounging for pneumonia.</v>

1246
00:53:55.561 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>debating.</v>

1247
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this could be really</v>

1248
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.890
<v Speaker 1>productive if people could sit down in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo,</v>

1249
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll debate you.</v>

1250
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might say outrageous things.</v>

1251
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:09.960
<v Speaker 1>He might say offensive things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he will debate.</v>

1252
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:14.120
<v Speaker 1>He will sit in front of a podium here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always time and anyone else will that</v>

1253
00:54:14.121 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Speaker 1>will have their time and they will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to take questions from the</v>

1254
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this could be very productive and</v>

1255
00:54:19.351 --> 00:54:24.351
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of figure out like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I are not far left and we're not</v>

1256
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:25.380
<v Speaker 1>far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1257
00:54:25.381 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 1>neither one of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

1258
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 1>we're in some sort of a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm more maybe more left than</v>

1259
00:54:30.571 --> 00:54:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not as left as a lot of people I</v>

1260
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:36.390
<v Speaker 1>know and there's a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I think this left white right</v>

1261
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 1>paradigm is really kind of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish at this point.</v>

1262
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.280
<v Speaker 1>And we should kind of figure out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

1263
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

1264
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:46.170
<v Speaker 1>what kind of opinions are okay to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't interfere with</v>

1265
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>anybody else's life.</v>

1266
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your philosophy and the way you look at</v>

1267
00:54:49.681 --> 00:54:52.950
<v Speaker 1>the world and you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express that opinion and express those</v>

1268
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 1>ideas in front of someone else who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opposing idea and they tell you why</v>

1269
00:54:56.641 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 1>they disagree and you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider why they disagree and see if</v>

1270
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:03.900
<v Speaker 1>there's any merit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem you're w with what you're</v>

1271
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>saying is you're implying that these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all informed people right and left and</v>

1272
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:08.970
<v Speaker 1>they need to hash out ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1273
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.500
<v Speaker 1>these people on the right are</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people who have looked it up</v>

1274
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 1>and want to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see a good debate.</v>

1275
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Pat Buchanan versus Sean Hannity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Brimelow versus some open borders</v>

1276
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:24.010
<v Speaker 1>libertarian like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1277
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Matt Walsh or something or someone from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal.</v>

1278
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.490
<v Speaker 1>All the inner right fights are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me.</v>

1279
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.280
<v Speaker 1>These people are religious fanatics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1280
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.260
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them it's sports.</v>

1281
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It's The Dallas cowboys is their team</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to fuck up your team.</v>

1282
00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 1>They don't want it to be like jared</v>
<v Speaker 1>diamond who did guns,</v>

1283
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:40.644
<v Speaker 1>germs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and steel.</v>

1284
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Tons of flaws with that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve sailor was begging him for debate.</v>

1285
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1286
00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 1>J uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared Taylor,</v>

1287
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:49.800
<v Speaker 1>John Derby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shire,</v>

1288
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.870
<v Speaker 1>all these three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Richard Spencer,</v>

1289
00:55:51.871 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 1>all these far right guys have made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

1290
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 1>They'd love to argue with anyone on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side and the other side knows that</v>

1291
00:55:57.661 --> 00:56:01.560
<v Speaker 1>they will lose because their foundation</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't truth or information.</v>

1292
00:56:01.561 --> 00:56:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Their foundation is just emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a nation of immigrants,</v>

1293
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:06.470
<v Speaker 1>so everything's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1294
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 1>gays are people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you like you think,</v>

1295
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think gays are fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your point?</v>

1296
00:56:11.791 --> 00:56:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand your side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1297
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm sure you saw that woman,</v>

1298
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.611
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>

1299
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:22.440
<v Speaker 1>a a middle school teacher who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a part of the protest at Berkeley.</v>

1300
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:27.830
<v Speaker 1>She was on Carlson Tucker Carlson show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was talking about fascism and</v>

1302
00:56:28.541 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 1>she said that Milo is homophobic even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though he's fucking gay.</v>

1303
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a racist.</v>

1304
00:56:32.111 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Homophobe who sucks black cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It's so hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was also saying that he promotes</v>

1306
00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just throw those labels</v>

1307
00:56:40.721 --> 00:56:41.960
<v Speaker 1>out and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1308
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a clear example of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about.</v>

1309
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:48.841
<v Speaker 1>Cause those labels allow her to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything necessary to get you out of the</v>

1310
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 1>mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's fascism.</v>

1311
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.200
<v Speaker 1>That is fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's authoritative,</v>

1312
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.390
<v Speaker 1>authoritative thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian thinking in a,</v>

1313
00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:01.600
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's eliminating someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>from expressing themselves because you</v>

1314
00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 1>have deemed them unworthy of expressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1315
00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:06.130
<v Speaker 1>They're off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a racist,</v>

1316
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 1>this is a homophobe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is someone who promotes genocide.</v>

1317
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.040
<v Speaker 1>We will shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

1318
00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 1>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could see from her talking on</v>

1319
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:17.230
<v Speaker 1>that show that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she talks over him.</v>

1320
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't express herself well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have clearly thought out</v>

1321
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 1>reasons for why she's saying he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

1322
00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have quotes and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>relying on,</v>

1323
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't say why it's so dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has these controversial</v>

1324
00:57:28.421 --> 00:57:30.910
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just says he's a Nazi,</v>

1325
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 1>he's a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a homophobe.</v>

1326
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 1>He promotes genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to shut them down.</v>

1327
00:57:35.111 --> 00:57:37.800
<v Speaker 1>But you can't just say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just label people cause</v>

1328
00:57:37.801 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 1>someone could do that to you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they will.</v>

1329
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.620
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

1330
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I forget her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelle give Ellis [inaudible] her</v>

1331
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:46.080
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is she really in my car</v>

1332
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:51.180
<v Speaker 2>by any means necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was game.</v>

1333
00:57:51.181 --> 00:57:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I like playing with these people is play</v>
<v Speaker 2>it through.</v>

1334
00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:54.570
<v Speaker 2>They do that at AIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1335
00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you want to be here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1336
00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.060
<v Speaker 2>have a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're gonna have another beer,</v>

1337
00:57:57.061 --> 00:57:58.530
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to get coke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

1338
00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:58.741
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1339
00:57:58.741 --> 00:57:59.320
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play it through.</v>

1340
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always say to these people,</v>

1341
00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:02.400
<v Speaker 2>play it through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he wants genocide.</v>

1342
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Trump wants denison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1343
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So he wants to kill what blacks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans.</v>

1344
00:58:06.861 --> 00:58:11.861
<v Speaker 2>So there's a van that drives to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>house in New Orleans and picks up these</v>

1345
00:58:11.911 --> 00:58:14.070
<v Speaker 2>black people and then they went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to a gas chamber.</v>

1346
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.020
<v Speaker 2>How does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens to their property?</v>

1347
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Is that divvied up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does a state on that now?</v>

1348
00:58:18.211 --> 00:58:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Like are you talking about the Cuban</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution?</v>

1349
00:58:20.191 --> 00:58:21.390
<v Speaker 2>The irony is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1350
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.520
<v Speaker 2>whenever you start describing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

1351
00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:25.710
<v Speaker 2>you end up describing Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba,</v>

1352
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:28.350
<v Speaker 2>socialist countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you end up describing the Middle</v>

1353
00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:28.510
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>

1354
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to want throw gays off</v>

1355
00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:31.100
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to,</v>

1356
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:33.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start stoning women to death who are</v>

1357
00:58:33.451 --> 00:58:36.030
<v Speaker 2>rape victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your villains right there,</v>

1358
00:58:36.031 --> 00:58:39.570
<v Speaker 2>but you're purposely ignoring him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that's going on</v>

1359
00:58:39.571 --> 00:58:41.630
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is still a theory I'm working on,</v>

1360
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but there seems to be a disturbing peek</v>
<v Speaker 2>at what a matriarchy would be like.</v>

1361
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:51.950
<v Speaker 2>And I'm seeing a lot of women in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements who are sort of vindictive and</v>

1362
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:56.070
<v Speaker 2>cruel and like this woman we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

1363
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:56.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1364
00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you watch these videos and you hear like</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck them up,</v>

1365
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:03.270
<v Speaker 2>get 'em get 'em these women voices from</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the crowd and I called him shit</v>

1366
00:59:03.271 --> 00:59:03.940
<v Speaker 2>chest</v>

1367
00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.140
<v Speaker 1>woman from the University of Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I get some muscle over here?</v>

1368
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Remember her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1369
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:08.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1370
00:59:08.551 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1371
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 2>She wants men to fight on her behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1372
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:13.750
<v Speaker 2>iron man has that blue thing in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>

1373
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think women are evil.</v>

1374
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I like women are like ironman there</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>

1375
00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by ripping out that blue thing,</v>

1376
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you're ripping out the</v>

1377
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 1>ability to have children and be mothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

1378
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you put in a piece of shit into</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man's chest.</v>

1379
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what feminists and like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman are there shit chests</v>

1380
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.430
<v Speaker 1>and they're malfunctioning robots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1381
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 1>this kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo wants genocide killing.</v>

1382
00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that they're imitating</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think are patriarchal</v>

1383
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:44.000
<v Speaker 1>societies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing their version of it and</v>

1384
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole matriarchal posturing.</v>

1385
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Clark Kent,</v>

1386
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to run an article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1387
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1388
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:54.740
<v Speaker 1>you're not ready it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go clerk,</v>

1389
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:56.090
<v Speaker 1>simmer down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1390
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 1>You write your article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing mine.</v>

1391
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he crunches.</v>

1392
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a whole lot of matriarchal</v>

1393
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.440
<v Speaker 1>societies in the animal world other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyenas.</v>

1394
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of them.</v>

1395
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a few where the females are</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger than the males.</v>

1396
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>A few bugs especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hyenas in particular,</v>

1397
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the female Hyena is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are much larger than the males.</v>

1398
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Even at fake dicks really have a pho</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis.</v>

1399
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>He has this big large tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake Dick that hangs down.</v>

1400
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>They actually give birth out of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they climb on top of the males and they</v>

1401
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>fucked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the speculation when there's a lot</v>

1402
01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>of speculation as to why the females are</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

1403
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is that they think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has to be bigger because Cayenne is</v>

1404
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>are so goddamn ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat their babies.</v>

1405
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the female has to go get the fuck</v>

1406
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>away from the baby cooked up when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets on top of books,</v>

1407
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you pieces of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my baby.</v>

1408
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no more,</v>

1409
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pun intended,</v>

1410
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>dog eat dog world than a fucking Hyena</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1411
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You're out there fighting for scraps</v>
<v Speaker 1>with lions.</v>

1412
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1413
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I actually have described to Antifa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people as hyenas because that</v>

1414
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>thing I was talking about at Berkeley</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are guys went in and said,</v>

1415
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought you guys were like tough or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1416
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:04.394
<v Speaker 1>was his exact quote.</v>

1417
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And they're going get him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get him,</v>

1418
01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the guys sort of give up</v>

1419
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>because no one wants to fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start walking away and then someone</v>

1420
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>runs up behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocks him out with a flag pole as</v>

1421
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>they're screaming these Italian slogans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1422
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fuck.</v>

1423
01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>She's thought [inaudible] oh from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1920s are having fun.</v>

1424
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>They knock yet game there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larping and then knocked him out.</v>

1425
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as he's out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hyenas come out and then they start</v>

1426
01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>kicking his unconscious body and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>start grabbing their,</v>

1427
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1428
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it's online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find it.</v>

1429
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly savages.</v>

1430
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>The scary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1431
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>you're going to invite right wing people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1432
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>to do the same thing and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some,</v>

1433
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>some veterans and you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fighters and you can do,</v>

1434
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>

1435
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be horrific man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be horrific.</v>

1436
01:01:48.531 --> 01:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start kicking their ass and then</v>

1437
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come back with weapons</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are going to show up with</v>

1438
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always leads to someone showing up</v>

1439
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:59.240
<v Speaker 1>with guns maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if this keeps going and these,</v>

1440
01:01:59.241 --> 01:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>these protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the things like the Milo</v>

1441
01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe now that Milo has been</v>

1442
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>humiliated and it at least temporarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>side tracked or put down for a bit while</v>

1443
01:02:10.611 --> 01:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>he has to rebuild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone can come along and have</v>

1444
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>reasonable dialog and do some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus be I don't like it.</v>

1445
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Why is he doing these things on</v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses?</v>

1446
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he gets paid for most of</v>

1447
01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1448
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>My theory with Milo is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his eyesight's getting worse.</v>

1449
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>His glasses are getting thicker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thicker and he's sorta going,</v>

1450
01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>this is my moment to make an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's just like,</v>

1451
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you think he's going blind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1452
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just theorizing this.</v>

1453
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's only like 28.</v>

1454
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you look at him,</v>

1455
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>he's just can't reading glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're insane.</v>

1456
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.143
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1457
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>And they're getting thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's stress,</v>

1458
01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressing his eyes worse.</v>

1459
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1460
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor.</v>

1461
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't think it would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think he's trying to make a</v>

1462
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 1>maximum impact in a short amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think he doesn't have much</v>

1463
01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>time left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a way.</v>

1464
01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:06.600
<v Speaker 1>He seems healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally wrecked eight.</v>

1465
01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were in Orlando,</v>

1466
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:09.750
<v Speaker 1>we made out at the site of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1467
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you guys made out at the Milo to offend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims.</v>

1468
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1469
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a big speech about freedom and</v>

1470
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>funny states in this America delicious</v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberries.</v>

1471
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least he freshens breath up before no</v>

1472
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>gaze just tastes better.</v>

1473
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck is lamb.</v>

1474
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And then we made out at the site of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orlando shooting to the Noi Muslims,</v>

1475
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:33.870
<v Speaker 1>but we had armed guards and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1476
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure these guys are</v>

1477
01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 1>scoping out the rooms and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1478
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if I die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll happily die for this.</v>

1479
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:40.921
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1480
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I do care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1481
01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I've got three kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

1482
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>is it Neil Ism or nihilism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say it wrong.</v>

1483
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I always say nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>

1484
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:52.370
<v Speaker 1>that nihilistic sort of instinct that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

1485
01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:57.180
<v Speaker 1>He has a burn it all down instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he has that with his life as</v>

1486
01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of that,</v>

1487
01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing some serious bro</v>

1488
01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:04.170
<v Speaker 1>psychologists here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1489
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>some armchair psychology from someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally unqualified,</v>

1490
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to attribute that to in</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in some ways being molested as</v>

1491
01:04:12.781 --> 01:04:13.614
<v Speaker 1>a child.</v>

1492
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that his experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's calling positive experiences</v>

1493
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways those could have</v>

1494
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 1>potentially damaged him and also being</v>
<v Speaker 1>young and being homosexual and being</v>

1495
01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things wreck havoc and you</v>

1496
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.320
<v Speaker 1>develop this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

1497
01:04:31.321 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to burn it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the strategies that</v>

1498
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:39.621
<v Speaker 1>he sort of adopted that strategy to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was very difficult for like</v>

1499
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:41.730
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay,</v>

1500
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.300
<v Speaker 1>he's an English gay guy who's a right</v>
<v Speaker 1>winger and mean it's,</v>

1501
01:04:47.781 --> 01:04:50.400
<v Speaker 1>it's so baffling to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do.</v>

1502
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>They hate it because they see blacks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gays as their little pets and they like</v>

1503
01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:57.450
<v Speaker 1>putting them on the front lines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>going look good who were helping.</v>

1504
01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And then when one of them defects to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>

1505
01:04:59.641 --> 01:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>they become particularly outraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few defect at the level that</v>

1506
01:05:03.481 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>he's defected.</v>

1507
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:05.121
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1508
01:05:05.121 --> 01:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>he turned around and started attacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct guy who bankrupted buzzfeed with</v>

1509
01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the Hulk Hogan lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Thiel,</v>

1510
01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teal.</v>

1511
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Teal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teal.</v>

1512
01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the silicon valley billionaire.</v>

1513
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>He's on trump's sort of board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1514
01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the people that trump has</v>

1515
01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>appointed to help him with technology or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1516
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find with it.</v>

1517
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It's Polish it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie a,</v>

1518
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1519
01:05:29.821 --> 01:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>a position that he has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1520
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting one cause he's a gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>man and he's a hugely successful</v>

1521
01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire character.</v>

1522
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a weird one too.</v>

1523
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Like these guys that get that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to,</v>

1524
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gay,</v>

1525
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.740
<v Speaker 1>you should be on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are,</v>

1526
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1527
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1528
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be on the left.</v>

1529
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Like when Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenner and steady still against gay</v>

1530
01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

1531
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>what about fuck?</v>

1532
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a trump supporter and he's against</v>

1533
01:05:57.881 --> 01:06:00.550
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now call me Caitlyn,</v>

1534
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>and this is my favorite part was when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked him like,</v>

1535
01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ellen,</v>

1536
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.540
<v Speaker 1>like really sort of grilled him on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

1537
01:06:07.541 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 1>we're all more of a traditionalist or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely aren't you?</v>

1538
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that makes sense to me though.</v>

1539
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you see women as so special</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a major thing to go over</v>

1540
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you must have a 1950s view of a</v>

1541
01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>lady that's a Dorothy Day girl with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>poodle skirt doing the vacuuming because</v>

1542
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 1>liberals and college students just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I are chicks,</v>

1543
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>so they don't see it as a long jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Bruce Jenner sees it as this massive</v>

1544
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.330
<v Speaker 1>pole vault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I Peter Thiel?</v>

1545
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1546
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Peter Thiel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teal ads,</v>

1547
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allies to trump transition.</v>

1548
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>So it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to make his mark on trump's</v>

1549
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:47.041
<v Speaker 1>transition team teal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a billionaire investor and facebook</v>

1550
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:51.730
<v Speaker 1>board member joined the transition team</v>
<v Speaker 1>days after the election and gradually</v>

1551
01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:53.380
<v Speaker 1>bringing in other members of his circle.</v>

1552
01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.730
<v Speaker 1>While teal clashed with Silicone Valley</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the campaign by endorsing trump</v>

1553
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.240
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this group may be the strongest or only</v>

1554
01:07:01.241 --> 01:07:05.110
<v Speaker 1>bridge between the tech industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the president elect,</v>

1555
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>this is to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while Gavin's painting,</v>

1556
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.960
<v Speaker 1>this is to me the most volatile time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can ever remember.</v>

1557
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Like the most vulnerable I've felt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>our country is like as a nation,</v>

1558
01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 1>like as a structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a traditional structure like</v>

1559
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 1>president and vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress and Senate.</v>

1560
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Now that Gavin's returning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying that I think this is</v>

1561
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>the most vulnerable I've ever felt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country is in terms of like its</v>

1562
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I just see it as a soldier divided</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleanup.</v>

1564
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think it's a cleanup and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what way?</v>

1566
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump hiring people as heads of</v>

1567
01:07:47.051 --> 01:07:50.230
<v Speaker 1>departments that hate that department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the government.</v>

1568
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I want it reduced to almost nothing.</v>

1569
01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have someone in the</v>

1570
01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Department of Education that likes</v>
<v Speaker 1>charter schools and hates public</v>

1571
01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:58.660
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go get in there.</v>

1572
01:07:58.661 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Just start dismantling the unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teachers' unions.</v>

1573
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Start tearing them to shreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it possible to fire a teacher.</v>

1574
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's get the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a huge,</v>

1575
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a huge issue.</v>

1576
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend whose daughter is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the school and he is absolutely</v>

1577
01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:16.090
<v Speaker 1>furious because the teacher has tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You literally can't fire the most.</v>

1578
01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>They commit some sort of a felony and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman doesn't give a fuck about her</v>

1579
01:08:20.061 --> 01:08:25.061
<v Speaker 1>classes and he was describing like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>negligent she is as a teacher and how</v>

1580
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:30.870
<v Speaker 1>how careless and how little effort she</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts into it because she has the class,</v>

1581
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>it's hers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a free paycheck and she's just</v>

1582
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>not the type of person that's committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our work and she can't be fired and</v>

1583
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>he's so furious and so frustrated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public school system and how it all</v>

1584
01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:43.220
<v Speaker 1>works at.</v>

1585
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna pull his daughter out and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>her in a private school now.</v>

1586
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to do that too.</v>

1587
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it the $40,000 posted note.</v>

1588
01:08:49.151 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I've got to post postnatal my daughter's</v>
<v Speaker 1>homework and said,</v>

1589
01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you're awesome while you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

1590
01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public schools.</v>

1591
01:08:55.391 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 1>She also got no markers because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter used markers on our homework.</v>

1592
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 1>M R K no markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a teacher.</v>

1593
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1594
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have that squiggly red line</v>

1595
01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:09.230
<v Speaker 1>underneath your text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to tell what the</v>

1596
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:11.210
<v Speaker 1>fuck you just said and what's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1597
01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this trump thing bother you with</v>

1598
01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:16.070
<v Speaker 1>the tax returns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1599
01:09:16.071 --> 01:09:17.390
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bothers me a lot.</v>

1600
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1601
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Cause I want to know how much money he</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes from Russia.</v>

1602
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>He's got significant business ties with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia apparently.</v>

1603
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.600
<v Speaker 1>W were you concerned about Hillary's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ties with Russia?</v>

1604
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1605
01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:27.691
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

1606
01:09:27.691 --> 01:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm know Hillary's porter by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the imagination.</v>

1607
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I think she's impossibly corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she represents,</v>

1608
01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:38.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this system where people get to a place</v>

1609
01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:41.840
<v Speaker 1>of influence and they use that influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make massive amounts of money by</v>

1610
01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:46.040
<v Speaker 1>giving speeches to bankers and finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to profit and look there.</v>

1611
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.660
<v Speaker 1>They're shutting down the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foundation,</v>

1612
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of that,</v>

1613
01:09:48.711 --> 01:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1615
01:09:50.261 --> 01:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1616
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:51.210
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1617
01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:53.690
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as she hasn't had any power</v>

1618
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:54.290
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

1619
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 1>how weird at this whole thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shutting down.</v>

1620
01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a pay to play scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1621
01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it's been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire time and everyone knows that,</v>

1622
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left didn't want to talk about it</v>

1623
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 1>because it weakens our position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It strengthens the right,</v>

1624
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but by not talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes them extremely vulnerable as</v>

1625
01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:08.510
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1626
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:12.230
<v Speaker 1>So I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no supporter of anything that she</v>

1627
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 1>stand for or bill stands for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now,</v>

1628
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes me nervous.</v>

1629
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spending more money on travel</v>

1630
01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:22.160
<v Speaker 1>and he complained how much of Obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent on travel.</v>

1631
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>The trump will have spent more money on</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel in the first seven months than</v>

1632
01:10:26.851 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Obama did in the entire eight years was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the White House because he's flying</v>

1633
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 1>back and forth tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lago,</v>

1634
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.380
<v Speaker 1>back and forth to Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing whatever the fuck he wants to</v>

1635
01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>find his kids when his kids have to fly</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do business forum,</v>

1636
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 1>when they're opening up casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all secret service.</v>

1637
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Everything is being done with taxpayer</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1638
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:47.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the most very consistently</v>

1639
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:52.391
<v Speaker 1>threatened president in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the Daily Mail printed this,</v>

1640
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.821
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1641
01:10:52.821 --> 01:10:57.020
<v Speaker 1>The Daily News in New York printed this</v>
<v Speaker 1>list of how many people would have to be</v>

1642
01:10:57.021 --> 01:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>killed to get to a Democrat and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just throwing this out there just</v>

1643
01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:01.750
<v Speaker 1>so you can see.</v>

1644
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to be this person and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the vice president and the</v>

1645
01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:06.800
<v Speaker 1>secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the postmaster general blah blah,</v>

1646
01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:07.101
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1647
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:07.934
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

1648
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 1>why are you publishing hit lists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>

1649
01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Because the pizzas come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it all over the place.</v>

1650
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>People will read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedians are talking about it too,</v>

1651
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:17.250
<v Speaker 1>like let's just take them out and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got to be taken out.</v>

1652
01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Comedians are saying more said something</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange could happen before some crazy</v>

1653
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>horror said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that too.</v>

1654
01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that was Sarah Silverman too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had this thing she was,</v>

1655
01:11:25.521 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>she was advocating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that once the military</v>

1656
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:30.040
<v Speaker 1>steps in the mad king will no longer be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1657
01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not want the fucking military to</v>

1658
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>run the country ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what that means?</v>

1659
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 1>If they can kill the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can kill you too.</v>

1660
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be absolutely out of your</v>

1661
01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking mind to want the military to</v>
<v Speaker 1>step in and run the country.</v>

1662
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 1>You are advocating a military</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship because by the way,</v>

1663
01:11:50.461 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens in the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes over when they take over.</v>

1664
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking vote now that's all</v>

1665
01:11:56.551 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people with the guns are now running</v>

1666
01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:01.350
<v Speaker 1>things and they do whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want and it's very inconvenient for</v>

1667
01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 1>them to have to sit down and listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who go to Largo on Tuesday night</v>

1668
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.890
<v Speaker 1>to watch Sarah Silverman speak like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very inconvenient for them to take your</v>

1669
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 1>opinion into consideration and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to,</v>

1670
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implication there too is that she's</v>

1671
01:12:13.441 --> 01:12:18.110
<v Speaker 1>running it like General Brigadier Judd</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apatow is calling up the commands of</v>

1672
01:12:18.111 --> 01:12:20.100
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Patton Oswald just don't think</v>

1673
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>they found the tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't thought it through.</v>

1674
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.700
<v Speaker 1>They never think it through because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just religion.</v>

1675
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:26.430
<v Speaker 1>It's all platitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all mods and rockers made up.</v>

1676
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's also,</v>

1677
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of posturing online when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making these statements online.</v>

1678
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it to not just because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something to say,</v>

1679
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.450
<v Speaker 1>which I believe there's something there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because you want love.</v>

1680
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.560
<v Speaker 1>You want people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like what you're saying,</v>

1681
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you want people to retweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want people to say,</v>

1682
01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:48.300
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is really on the ball.</v>

1683
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.330
<v Speaker 1>That girl is really on top of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1684
01:12:51.331 --> 01:12:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you go girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're saying the right things.</v>

1685
01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck him.</v>

1686
01:12:54.781 --> 01:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're,</v>

1687
01:12:55.721 --> 01:12:59.100
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not thinking this thing out.</v>

1688
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.550
<v Speaker 1>You had a contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking contest.</v>

1689
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:05.910
<v Speaker 1>The person that you had go against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that you were,</v>

1690
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want to win sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the person who won won the fucking</v>

1691
01:13:11.191 --> 01:13:12.024
<v Speaker 1>contest.</v>

1692
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't just come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the military has to take over</v>

1693
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:17.340
<v Speaker 1>because I don't agree with the results</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the contest.</v>

1694
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 1>We have a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country is filled with 350 million</v>

1695
01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:22.614
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1696
01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:27.300
<v Speaker 1>enough with your shitty electoral</v>
<v Speaker 1>college system decided that this guy</v>

1697
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.280
<v Speaker 1>should win the contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Won.</v>

1698
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>He won fucking fair and square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not the Russians were</v>

1699
01:13:31.981 --> 01:13:35.100
<v Speaker 1>involved in hacking the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take that aside,</v>

1700
01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.580
<v Speaker 1>look at it for what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what the Russians exposed was</v>

1701
01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:40.770
<v Speaker 1>fucking corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

<v Speaker 1>emails there was,</v>

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:10.340
<v Speaker 1>there was also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very clear collusion where they were</v>

1714
01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:13.840
<v Speaker 1>making that Bernie Sanders did not win</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primaries.</v>

1715
01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was where it was most disturbing to</v>

1716
01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>me because it's that leap through</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails.</v>

1717
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1718
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1719
01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.660
<v Speaker 1>she did something corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the crops and they're saying,</v>

1721
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans didn't,</v>

1722
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>didn't get exposed and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implication is that the Russians had</v>

1723
01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>something on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a deal.</v>

1724
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:33.670
<v Speaker 1>But how do you know that's the case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might not have done anything</v>

1725
01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also possible.</v>

1726
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that if you look at the</v>

1727
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>very minimal amount of things that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>done by the DNC,</v>

1728
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.830
<v Speaker 1>there's just a few incidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them landed anybody in jail.</v>

1729
01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we can kind of agree that</v>

1730
01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:49.240
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they are corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fairly minimal,</v>

1731
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:52.150
<v Speaker 1>even though you are fucking with</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

1732
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what you're doing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rigging the primers.</v>

1733
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking with democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one went to jail.</v>

1734
01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:59.920
<v Speaker 1>So the worst case scenario that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a tribute that was attributed to</v>

1735
01:14:59.921 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 1>them was still not enough to warrant a</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal investigation or jail time.</v>

1736
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Then you have the other side and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to assume that their side was</v>

1737
01:15:07.661 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 1>more egregious or was it equal and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not exposed.</v>

1738
01:15:10.781 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1739
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 1>all the shit that was exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at all,</v>

1740
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 1>look at that Billy Bush interview you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me that sounded worse than</v>

1741
01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:19.780
<v Speaker 1>anything that was exposed on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side as far as like public opinion,</v>

1742
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to resonate more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it was just a dumb</v>

1743
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:23.800
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed to be,</v>

1744
01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what that march was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pussy joke.</v>

1745
01:15:26.111 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1746
01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:29.590
<v Speaker 1>trump won because of transgender</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathrooms.</v>

1747
01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 1>He won because of the grievement</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

1748
01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.690
<v Speaker 1>He won because of the liberal media</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning stories.</v>

1749
01:15:34.691 --> 01:15:37.330
<v Speaker 1>He won because we're all sick of</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor obamacare.</v>

1750
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Obamacare was a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so much animosity built up</v>

1751
01:15:41.021 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 1>against the establishment that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodney dangerfield showed up in,</v>

1752
01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Speaker 1>in Tartan Pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and today you whoa,</v>

1753
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1754
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.730
<v Speaker 1>someone stepped on a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all went,</v>

1755
01:15:48.731 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 1>that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to come in and just blow it</v>

1756
01:15:51.731 --> 01:15:54.520
<v Speaker 1>all up and let's start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't leak.</v>

1757
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.620
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ties to the Russians,</v>

1758
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:58.330
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't bother you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1759
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.040
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he won't release his</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>

1760
01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:01.270
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1761
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.990
<v Speaker 1>that bothers me because we should know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where money comes from.</v>

1762
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.860
<v Speaker 1>But look at what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this obsession with reframing.</v>

1763
01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Things like Milo's sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1764
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.460
<v Speaker 1>has been construed to mean he wants 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds to have sex all the time with</v>

1765
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:18.424
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

1766
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time they get a,</v>

1767
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.080
<v Speaker 1>like w ann coulter said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our blacks are better than their blacks.</v>

1768
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 1>She meant conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blacks tend to be more well researched</v>

1769
01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:29.230
<v Speaker 1>cause they get a hammering at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving from their family and</v>

1770
01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not conforming to the majority</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their race.</v>

1771
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So they tend to be heartened that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>construed into ankles or thinks we still</v>

1772
01:16:37.211 --> 01:16:41.380
<v Speaker 1>have slaves and blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can just see the way these tax</v>

1773
01:16:41.381 --> 01:16:43.660
<v Speaker 1>returns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in an era where we seem to</v>

1774
01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:46.390
<v Speaker 1>hate entrepreneurs and we seem to hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

1775
01:16:46.391 --> 01:16:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard so many people criticized</v>

1776
01:16:48.991 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 1>trump saying he's a billionaire or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>betsy devoss cause she's a billionaire</v>

1777
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and you go since when is that a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>insult?</v>

1778
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing everyone on earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be.</v>

1779
01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1780
01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're kind of setting up a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a straw man with that because I don't</v>

1781
01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:07.810
<v Speaker 1>think that's just what people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging and what people are upset</v>

1782
01:17:07.811 --> 01:17:11.510
<v Speaker 1>about with trump with they're about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they believe that he might be</v>

1783
01:17:11.511 --> 01:17:15.710
<v Speaker 1>influenced by foreign governments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a vested interest in controlling</v>

1784
01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:16.670
<v Speaker 1>our democracy.</v>

1785
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the Russian thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

1786
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:21.800
<v Speaker 1>If he's making considerable amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money in Russia and a considerable</v>

1787
01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 1>amount of money in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to wonder whether or not he</v>

1788
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:28.370
<v Speaker 1>will be influenced by that financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>tie,</v>

1789
01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:32.510
<v Speaker 1>by those financial ties and whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that that will influence way the</v>

1790
01:17:32.511 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 1>policy that it creates in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not he allows things to</v>

1791
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:37.790
<v Speaker 1>happen that we don't think should</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

1792
01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.950
<v Speaker 1>just so that he can profit valid</v>
<v Speaker 1>concern,</v>

1793
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's not proven yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it is proven,</v>

1794
01:17:43.521 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll drag him out of the White House by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his heels.</v>

1795
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.320
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that the only way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ever going to really prove that</v>

1796
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 1>is by seeing his taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

1797
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you have to see his tax returns and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>business works.</v>

1798
01:17:53.401 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I bring up this Auntie Auntie</v>

1799
01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with the bankruptcy laws in the</v>

1800
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 1>nineties everyone was taking advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bankruptcy laws because the</v>

1801
01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:03.440
<v Speaker 1>government was so bad at its job.</v>

1802
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1803
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 1>trump had to go on at the same with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing,</v>

1804
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:11.120
<v Speaker 1>his ties in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to make things in America</v>

1805
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.720
<v Speaker 1>like toy dolls it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to be 17 times the price</v>

1806
01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:16.880
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't make them in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like it would be a</v>

1807
01:18:16.881 --> 01:18:18.920
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't possible.</v>

1808
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Once that system is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to adhere to that system if</v>

1809
01:18:23.631 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eventually change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people are going to see</v>

1810
01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:27.740
<v Speaker 1>these tax returns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the fuck they're</v>

1811
01:18:27.741 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 1>doing and they're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1812
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 1>here's proof that he's in bed with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1813
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:33.080
<v Speaker 1>But well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are going to be able to</v>

1814
01:18:33.081 --> 01:18:35.740
<v Speaker 1>analyze them and come up with accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessments of where,</v>

1815
01:18:35.741 --> 01:18:39.200
<v Speaker 1>where he's being influenced and where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes money and why that can be a</v>

1816
01:18:39.201 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 1>problem and why could be a conflict of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

1817
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.100
<v Speaker 1>But we should be able to have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1818
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Every single president before him has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been forthcoming with that information.</v>

1819
01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:48.110
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1820
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:51.650
<v Speaker 1>every day was going to release a</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial loser maybe,</v>

1821
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.790
<v Speaker 1>but he said he was going to release it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up until the moment where he got in and</v>

1822
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:56.900
<v Speaker 1>then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1823
01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>why should I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I dunno.</v>

1824
01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think they should force him to</v>

1825
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:01.820
<v Speaker 1>release the tax returns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She to me,</v>

1826
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 1>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

1827
01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:03.580
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1828
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:06.440
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about foreign influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had Hillary,</v>

1829
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:09.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing us her foreign influence,</v>

1830
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.380
<v Speaker 1>rainy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we showed her selling the</v>

1831
01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.510
<v Speaker 1>presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having Bill Clinton do a talk about this</v>

1832
01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:15.950
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exonerate trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1833
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where were you then?</v>

1834
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.460
<v Speaker 1>You pronounce it of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1835
01:19:19.461 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking to them.</v>

1836
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talking to me and I'm,</v>

1837
01:19:22.681 --> 01:19:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a left wing hillary supporter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in any way,</v>

1838
01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:27.020
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

1839
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I just think that if we're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a president,</v>

1840
01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we have to have some pretty universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that we follow.</v>

1841
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And one of them should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president should be beyond</v>

1842
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.960
<v Speaker 1>influenced by foreign governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's really,</v>

1843
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 1>there's really not a whole lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell what's influencing you other</v>

1844
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 1>than tax returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1845
01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:45.440
<v Speaker 1>you're implying that in these tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>returns,</v>

1846
01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see massive checks from</v>
<v Speaker 1>rush.</v>

1847
01:19:46.941 --> 01:19:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying we should find out.</v>

1848
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

1849
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1850
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you're the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't,</v>

1851
01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very eroding.</v>

1852
01:19:56.610 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It erodes the public confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hide that,</v>

1853
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Speaker 1>if you conceal that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't tell us where you have your</v>

1854
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:06.910
<v Speaker 1>money stored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't tell us where you're,</v>

1855
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.240
<v Speaker 1>where you're making money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have bank accounts,</v>

1856
01:20:09.241 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know there's,</v>

1857
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of factors involved in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like trump was running a massive</v>

1858
01:20:14.551 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>global empire and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't know like where he's being</v>

1859
01:20:19.051 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 1>influenced through his financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>

1860
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's really problematic</v>

1861
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:25.650
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1862
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a real dangerous thing to deny it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's always been,</v>

1863
01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:33.120
<v Speaker 1>it's always her spin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what presidents do and we've always said</v>

1864
01:20:33.121 --> 01:20:35.250
<v Speaker 1>it was a good thing and I always thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was law.</v>

1865
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that there was a way to get</v>

1866
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>around under a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're under the being an under audit</v>

1867
01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:44.340
<v Speaker 1>right now that was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says it's still going and it's been</v>

1868
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:47.070
<v Speaker 1>going since the 70s or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or that atl area.</v>

1869
01:20:47.071 --> 01:20:49.360
<v Speaker 1>So he just has to keep the audit going</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't have to tell us how</v>

1870
01:20:49.361 --> 01:20:49.880
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1871
01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand your logic.</v>

1872
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger picture here is I think that</v>

1873
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:57.060
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand that he took a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major hit and uh,</v>

1874
01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:00.390
<v Speaker 1>becoming president financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was part of the appeal.</v>

1875
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Americans went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1876
01:21:01.831 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you're putting it all on the line for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1877
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 1>But he's not losing tons of my sons are</v>
<v Speaker 1>running the business and they're doing a</v>

1878
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 1>great job doing it took a huge hit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>none,</v>

1879
01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.990
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so is residences the golf courses?</v>

1880
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mara Lago,</v>

1881
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 1>the attendance is up and they raise the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1882
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 1>admission fee to $200,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much it costs now to join</v>

1883
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:26.130
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My understanding is the brand with his</v>

1884
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:29.340
<v Speaker 1>residencies and his golf clubs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else took a major hit.</v>

1885
01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in New York and you say,</v>

1886
01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 1>we're up mets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mattress company,</v>

1887
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 1>well it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that people are anti med,</v>

1888
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but now Yankees fans don't want your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mattress.</v>

1889
01:21:38.971 --> 01:21:41.400
<v Speaker 1>So Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything political when you're a brand</v>

1890
01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:44.520
<v Speaker 1>like that is going to lose you 50% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your followers.</v>

1891
01:21:44.521 --> 01:21:46.860
<v Speaker 1>And he went on a limb and if you'd lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>the election,</v>

1892
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 1>he still would have had that brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage without any of the benefits and</v>

1893
01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.110
<v Speaker 1>what he saw and put everything on black</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they went,</v>

1894
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you risking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has that been proven that his brand has</v>

1895
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:56.250
<v Speaker 1>been damaged?</v>

1896
01:21:56.250 --> 01:22:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's been any studies of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>attendance or a residency's dropping</v>

1897
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.620
<v Speaker 1>that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the people that owned condos</v>

1898
01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 1>in one of the trump buildings tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the name in New York.</v>

1899
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:10.920
<v Speaker 1>They literally ripped the word trump off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their building.</v>

1900
01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:12.330
<v Speaker 1>They did do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1901
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1902
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 1>they had construction and these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that own condos in that building.</v>

1903
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

1904
01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a place where you buy the New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird like that.</v>

1905
01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:24.420
<v Speaker 1>You buy your apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>

1906
01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 1>But they pulled the trump name down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1907
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:29.640
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose idea is that and how do we get</v>

1908
01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:32.730
<v Speaker 1>away board all agreed it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic decision and they said,</v>

1909
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:34.530
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't want to be targeted</v>

1910
01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was there right after the</v>

1911
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just happened to be there because of</v>

1912
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:41.460
<v Speaker 1>the UFC was there and Madison Square</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garden right after the election.</v>

1913
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 1>So I walked to the gym and when I came</v>
<v Speaker 1>back it was like,</v>

1914
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 1>why we're in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the riots or the parade?</v>

1915
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.360
<v Speaker 1>The march started and so we walked back</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the thick of it and they were</v>

1916
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 1>parked out in front of the trump tower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking scream and a bunch of</v>

1917
01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:00.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the project,</v>

1918
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:01.381
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

1919
01:23:01.381 --> 01:23:02.430
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

1920
01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti gay.</v>

1921
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.610
<v Speaker 1>His guy just kept screaming that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did that even come from?</v>

1922
01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did another thing where they,</v>

1923
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1924
01:23:09.221 --> 01:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>they dance up freedom outside of Mike</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pence,</v>

1925
01:23:11.441 --> 01:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not even there.</v>

1926
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Like he gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never said gaze can't dance.</v>

1927
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And then they just do that in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start making out with each other in</v>

1928
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.880
<v Speaker 1>front of the trump building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to go,</v>

1929
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:23.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

1930
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Stop it army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1931
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't see Gargamel from the smurfs.</v>

1932
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I hade that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1933
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:34.420
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier with labeling Milo a Nazi</v>

1934
01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:39.190
<v Speaker 1>and a fascist and homophobic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting genocide.</v>

1935
01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 1>If you just say those words and defined</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1936
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you immediately put them in a nice box</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can attack.</v>

1937
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so by someone you,</v>

1938
01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.760
<v Speaker 1>this guy was right next to me fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming it.</v>

1939
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump KKK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

1940
01:23:51.641 --> 01:23:53.740
<v Speaker 1>sexist anti day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was hilarious.</v>

1941
01:23:53.741 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 1>He saw a black guy come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts yelling,</v>

1942
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter.</v>

1943
01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you son of a bitch.</v>

1944
01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:03.190
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come up with this concept that the</v>

1945
01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:06.130
<v Speaker 1>president is pro hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they go,</v>

1946
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 1>hey trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against hate.</v>

1947
01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>

1948
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:13.360
<v Speaker 1>So they build a straw man and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking him and letting him on</v>

1949
01:24:13.361 --> 01:24:16.560
<v Speaker 1>fire and the rest of us are going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care that your lighting is scare</v>

1950
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:19.300
<v Speaker 1>crow on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look fucking ridiculous.</v>

1951
01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not empowering their cause to be</v>

1952
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:29.250
<v Speaker 1>exaggerating about his stances on things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like gay rights or any of these other</v>

1953
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:31.420
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not empowering.</v>

1954
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So when you say he's KKK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say he's anti gay,</v>

1955
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:37.800
<v Speaker 1>when you say he's racist without like</v>
<v Speaker 1>real proof,</v>

1956
01:24:37.801 --> 01:24:42.801
<v Speaker 1>like you could say that he has said some</v>
<v Speaker 1>very racist things about some Mexicans.</v>

1957
01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:45.190
<v Speaker 1>You can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No you can't.</v>

1958
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that you just talking</v>

1959
01:24:46.571 --> 01:24:50.080
<v Speaker 1>about all the rapists and murderers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are coming over from Mexico who crossed</v>

1960
01:24:50.081 --> 01:24:51.400
<v Speaker 1>the border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women get raped.</v>

1961
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 1>They're at the point now where these</v>
<v Speaker 1>women just take contraception.</v>

1962
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the deal,</v>

1963
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it's not rape at this</v>

1964
01:24:58.271 --> 01:25:00.820
<v Speaker 1>point because it's a currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1965
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to people that are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>across was saying they're sending</v>

1966
01:25:03.401 --> 01:25:04.330
<v Speaker 1>they're rapists.</v>

1967
01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1968
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are a Mexico as an program</v>

1969
01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 1>where they send their criminals over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board that he did a good job of</v>

1970
01:25:11.741 --> 01:25:14.260
<v Speaker 1>expressing that if that's what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to say.</v>

1971
01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think he could have been more</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured and he could have done it in a</v>

1972
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:19.210
<v Speaker 1>way that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not how he talks.</v>

1973
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He could've done it in a way that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have removed any doubt as to what his</v>

1974
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:24.910
<v Speaker 1>intentions are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How he feels about people,</v>

1975
01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is chest like sometimes he talks</v>

1976
01:25:27.821 --> 01:25:30.480
<v Speaker 1>like an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing bad things and then</v>

1977
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:31.090
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

1978
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you realize four days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1979
01:25:33.011 --> 01:25:35.380
<v Speaker 1>that was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with the Mexicans thing,</v>

1980
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:37.090
<v Speaker 1>these Mexicans are rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go what?</v>

1981
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And then you look it up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1982
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.070
<v Speaker 1>80% of these women get raped crossing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the border by these coyotes.</v>

1983
01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Holy Crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another example of this,</v>

1984
01:25:44.651 --> 01:25:47.500
<v Speaker 1>him being four steps ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when he says he's trying to do this</v>

1985
01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:48.370
<v Speaker 1>travel ban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1986
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Muslims are a threat to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone goes,</v>

1987
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:52.270
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>

1988
01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the press isn't reporting on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>following terrorism cases,</v>

1989
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:56.711
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1990
01:25:56.711 --> 01:25:57.191
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1991
01:25:57.191 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 1>He lists about 20 so then the meeting he</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

1992
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:01.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We reported on this,</v>

1993
01:26:01.181 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 1>we were putting on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put it on the London bombing,</v>

1994
01:26:02.921 --> 01:26:04.550
<v Speaker 1>we on Bengazi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we reported on this.</v>

1995
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And then he dupe them into talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism for three days straight.</v>

1996
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden his travel ban looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty reasonable.</v>

1997
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1998
01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:17.180
<v Speaker 1>So he's off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's often setting a trap for people</v>

1999
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that they come bounding into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2000
01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he's doing it on purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether or not,</v>

2001
01:26:20.961 --> 01:26:25.961
<v Speaker 1>just by finding things that he can say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that backup his point,</v>

2002
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 1>he's starting that conversation off in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they wouldn't ordinarily start</v>

2003
01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have been what happened with</v>

2004
01:26:30.981 --> 01:26:31.814
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he goes,</v>

2005
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.820
<v Speaker 1>look what happened with Sweden last</v>
<v Speaker 1>night on a particularly dead night in</v>

2006
01:26:34.821 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>

2007
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 1>look how many blacks died in gang</v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare today in Chicago.</v>

2008
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.450
<v Speaker 1>It might be none today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2009
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:45.320
<v Speaker 1>But the average is years to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look it up and you go,</v>

2010
01:26:45.321 --> 01:26:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>780 people died in Chicago this year.</v>

2011
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 1>W is today the 22nd there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant event on the 21st in Sweden.</v>

2012
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Massive laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2014
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.700
<v Speaker 1>it's Sweden has got problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe has problems there.</v>

2015
01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 1>They definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whenever you have people from one</v>

2016
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:03.140
<v Speaker 1>culture that immigrate into another</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and they're disenfranchised and</v>

2017
01:27:03.141 --> 01:27:08.141
<v Speaker 1>poor and they have a really not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to keep going with it.</v>

2018
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they also have a really restrictive</v>

2019
01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:14.720
<v Speaker 1>fucked up culture that they're coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from and they want to impose that</v>

2020
01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>culture on the people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany or wherever and they want women</v>

2021
01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:21.680
<v Speaker 1>to start wearing long dresses and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat them like they're whores.</v>

2022
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 1>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all fucking real dangerous.</v>

2023
01:27:23.991 --> 01:27:27.020
<v Speaker 1>They're from a different part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and it's a part of the world that</v>

2024
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:32.350
<v Speaker 1>hasn't changed much in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that part of the world,</v>

2025
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could call it culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call it religious tradition,</v>

2026
01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but whenever you're dealing with a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world that still has honor</v>

2027
01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:43.980
<v Speaker 1>killings and female genital mutilation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't let women drive and you</v>

2028
01:27:43.981 --> 01:27:45.800
<v Speaker 1>know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you women aren't allowed to vote and you</v>

2029
01:27:45.801 --> 01:27:49.510
<v Speaker 1>have this incredibly restrictive world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are,</v>

2030
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 1>your existing him and then you bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world somewhere else,</v>

2031
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a culture clash.</v>

2032
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

2033
01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:56.480
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2034
01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 1>if you want people to be free and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want people to have the ability to</v>

2035
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:03.890
<v Speaker 1>integrate into a more free culture like</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is,</v>

2036
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you also have to be honest about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences are and you have to be</v>

2037
01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:09.800
<v Speaker 1>honest about what kind of culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming from.</v>

2038
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get labeled in Islamophobia.</v>

2039
01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Soon as you talk about this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictive,</v>

2040
01:28:15.831 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic culture that's based on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient,</v>

2041
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:24.010
<v Speaker 1>ancient series of rituals and beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you become a racist and a bigot by</v>

2042
01:28:24.301 --> 01:28:27.770
<v Speaker 1>talking about a reality like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not a race?</v>

2043
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.890
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about culture and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to make that distinction</v>

2044
01:28:30.891 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 1>as a Western chauvinist that I think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>West is the best.</v>

2045
01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what race you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that other cultures</v>

2046
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 1>are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're worse and Islam is 500</v>

2047
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:41.870
<v Speaker 1>years behind us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were shitty.</v>

2048
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.050
<v Speaker 1>We had witch hunts inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the inquisition.</v>

2049
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>They're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not caught up to us yet.</v>

2050
01:28:47.271 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not as advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think two big problems with them</v>

2051
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:53.510
<v Speaker 1>as far as progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress goes is the Koran is an</v>

2052
01:28:53.511 --> 01:28:57.200
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally violent book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a 2.0 the way Christians</v>

2053
01:28:57.201 --> 01:29:00.410
<v Speaker 1>do and no one ever talks about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have a major problem with</v>

2054
01:29:00.411 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>inbreeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

2055
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 2>are marrying their first cousins again</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again and again.</v>

2056
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:09.810
<v Speaker 2>And that makes your evolution group</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

2057
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Is this true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you getting that from?</v>

2058
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 2>I never ever heard of ginnaty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called Muhammad said it's</v>

2059
01:29:15.631 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>okay to marry your first cousin for real</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do that once or twice.</v>

2060
01:29:19.861 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad and you do it for 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations and now you're going back in</v>

2061
01:29:23.911 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 2>time and look at Iran in 1965 mini</v>
<v Speaker 2>skirts,</v>

2062
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>woman doing chemistry with test tubes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving around.</v>

2063
01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go to the Gogo hot later and</v>

2064
01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:35.280
<v Speaker 2>now just garbage bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2065
01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Gregorian chants everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've gone backwards in time.</v>

2066
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And I blame obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the courage and the culture and</v>

2067
01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:45.270
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I think inbreeding enables them</v>

2068
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:47.800
<v Speaker 2>to get hijacked by these radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've got,</v>

2069
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you think they can beat snakebites in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America?</v>

2070
01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Can you mentioned them taking over</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity?</v>

2071
01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:52.763
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2072
01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 2>there are people in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2073
01:29:54.751 --> 01:29:56.910
<v Speaker 2>that the do do that still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

2074
01:29:56.970 --> 01:30:00.510
<v Speaker 2>But they're not taking over America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they took over of the Middle</v>

2075
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:03.120
<v Speaker 2>East you think is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the equivalent as far as their,</v>

2076
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:05.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Irshad Manji and uh,</v>

2077
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trouble with Islam,</v>

2078
01:30:07.651 --> 01:30:12.651
<v Speaker 2>she says a weird group of Wasabi is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>hijack their religion and sent it into</v>

2079
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:13.920
<v Speaker 2>the dark ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

2080
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:17.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how were they vulnerable to</v>

2081
01:30:17.101 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>hijacking Christianity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't be hijacked by the snake guys.</v>

2082
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.990
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a part of it was inbreeding.</v>

2083
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our own theory.</v>

2084
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:28.021
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2085
01:30:28.021 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at them and breeding major,</v>

2086
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.010
<v Speaker 2>major problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never heard this,</v>

2087
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:34.410
<v Speaker 2>but especially with immigrants in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>

2088
01:30:34.411 --> 01:30:38.010
<v Speaker 2>like the Pakistanis in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have all kinds of serious</v>

2089
01:30:38.011 --> 01:30:42.240
<v Speaker 2>inbreeding problems because that's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>even smaller sample size you're dealing</v>

2090
01:30:42.241 --> 01:30:43.074
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>

2091
01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 2>And every time I bring this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>

2092
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about white people hillbillies?</v>

2093
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.570
<v Speaker 2>They were in breeding or royalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were in breeding.</v>

2094
01:30:48.571 --> 01:30:49.590
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2095
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:52.400
<v Speaker 2>And it went real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad move.</v>

2096
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Learned the hard way we saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deliverance.</v>

2097
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the first,</v>

2098
01:30:56.101 --> 01:30:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but pull it up.</v>

2099
01:30:57.691 --> 01:30:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2100
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're not lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find anything?</v>

2101
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Something on snopes popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2102
01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:06.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snopes,</v>

2103
01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:08.650
<v Speaker 1>snopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snopes is,</v>

2104
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I found out about the origins of</v>

2105
01:31:11.651 --> 01:31:15.340
<v Speaker 1>snopes and who's running snopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who married a prostitute and</v>

2106
01:31:15.341 --> 01:31:17.860
<v Speaker 1>left his wife and didn't know the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal that guys partying.</v>

2107
01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:21.550
<v Speaker 1>He married some woman who was an escort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen the story on snopes?</v>

2108
01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who ran snopes ran it with his</v>

2109
01:31:23.771 --> 01:31:26.440
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left his wife for a prostitute.</v>

2110
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:29.530
<v Speaker 1>She's still in him because all the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spent on prostitutes.</v>

2111
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he married the prostitute and she's</v>

2112
01:31:32.171 --> 01:31:35.310
<v Speaker 1>not a prostitute anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she works for snopes and uh,</v>

2113
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.120
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was a husband and wife team.</v>

2114
01:31:37.121 --> 01:31:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that's how they met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2115
01:31:38.481 --> 01:31:39.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2116
01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:39.721
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

2117
01:31:39.721 --> 01:31:42.610
<v Speaker 1>there was a husband and wife team and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's a husband with the new wife.</v>

2118
01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And then there are suing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ex wife and the husband or suing</v>

2119
01:31:46.511 --> 01:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>each other over who gets the money.</v>

2120
01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Some big crazy story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just got a big fucking smile on</v>

2121
01:31:51.311 --> 01:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>his face and he's hanging out with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

2122
01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:57.100
<v Speaker 1>He used to be an escort and I find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>distasteful unless it's Richard Gere and</v>

2123
01:31:57.101 --> 01:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Julia Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're gorgeous.</v>

2124
01:31:58.811 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2125
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the prostitute at one point in time,</v>

2126
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:04.450
<v Speaker 1>the Gow who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2127
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 1>worked as an escort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

2128
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dated an escort ones.</v>

2129
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you Holla while she was escorting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2130
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Post Post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was molested as a kid.</v>

2131
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>

2132
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 1>for sex for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to go super intense,</v>

2133
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 1>like public humiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wanted me to slap her in a grocery</v>

2134
01:32:22.691 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 1>store and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

2135
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Because intimacy had been ruined by dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2136
01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So that we had to leap over that and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into mean stuff.</v>

2137
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2138
01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that brings me back to what you were</v>

2139
01:32:34.211 --> 01:32:36.550
<v Speaker 1>saying earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just spitball here.</v>

2140
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Molestation gaze.</v>

2141
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Here's my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2142
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I think 1% of people are gay and 1% 1%</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theory,</v>

2143
01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.330
<v Speaker 1>like you were thinking 10 all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's crazy.</v>

2144
01:32:47.331 --> 01:32:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Told people that's not.</v>

2145
01:32:49.691 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 1>So remember your classrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have three classes.</v>

2146
01:32:51.911 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 1>There was that one fe guy who wore</v>
<v Speaker 1>lacrosse a few costs.</v>

2147
01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be as high as five,</v>

2148
01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2149
01:32:58.811 --> 01:33:01.810
<v Speaker 1>unless you're in some place with maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a gas leak,</v>

2150
01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:05.230
<v Speaker 1>well that's what we're getting at nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nurture.</v>

2151
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:06.400
<v Speaker 1>So out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

2152
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 1>these are gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are lesbians.</v>

2153
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I think a higher proportion of lesbians</v>
<v Speaker 1>are that way for getting from getting</v>

2154
01:33:14.231 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 1>molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier to go with a woman cause</v>

2155
01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 1>they're not as gross as Cox.</v>

2156
01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in a more nurturing and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>also been sexualized by our culture.</v>

2157
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:23.771
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2158
01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:26.320
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly on billboards selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and the right,</v>

2159
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's girls kissing girls is hot,</v>

2160
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just get a strap on there.</v>

2161
01:33:30.701 --> 01:33:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I can have a dude and I want to think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

2162
01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just totally spit balling here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it up.</v>

2163
01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:37.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say a third of lesbians</v>
<v Speaker 1>were molested.</v>

2164
01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

2165
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lie within the percentage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gays.</v>

2166
01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna say a fifth,</v>

2167
01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 1>a fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is talking out of my ass here.</v>

2168
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.560
<v Speaker 1>A fifth of gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's possible that Milo was that way.</v>

2169
01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Lena Dunham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister Lena brags about molesting her</v>

2170
01:33:53.321 --> 01:33:55.480
<v Speaker 1>sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a lesbian now she has.</v>

2171
01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

2172
01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you get molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be by anyone.</v>

2173
01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And Sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2174
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 1>brings you bad feeling thing.</v>

2175
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>When children experience sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're not sexual,</v>

2176
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 1>like when they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hormones have been kicked in.</v>

2177
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:12.190
<v Speaker 1>They haven't reached puberty and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced sex at a very early age.</v>

2178
01:34:12.191 --> 01:34:15.040
<v Speaker 1>They become hypersexualized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say that that's one of the</v>

2179
01:34:15.041 --> 01:34:16.750
<v Speaker 1>things that happens to women that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>molested.</v>

2180
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 1>And they speculate that that could also</v>
<v Speaker 1>be one of the things that happened to</v>

2181
01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:25.480
<v Speaker 1>men when they experience a molestation</v>
<v Speaker 1>by another man at an early age.</v>

2182
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And there's an imprinting that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Ryan,</v>

2183
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 1>where the author of a sex at dawn has</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about this,</v>

2184
01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's imprinting that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the formative years and I forget</v>

2185
01:34:34.871 --> 01:34:38.350
<v Speaker 1>what those years are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said between 10 and 14.</v>

2186
01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:42.120
<v Speaker 1>But things that can happen during those</v>
<v Speaker 1>years are they like,</v>

2187
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 1>they like a lock in and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people develop fetishes and they develop</v>

2188
01:34:46.751 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of weird sort of like kinky</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of things that they connect to sex.</v>

2189
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's because of the fact that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and mind are developing your</v>

2190
01:34:55.181 --> 01:34:56.650
<v Speaker 1>hormones kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

2192
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:59.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2193
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a disturbing trait and your job as</v>

2194
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:08.000
<v Speaker 1>a parent and as a society is to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids as pure for as long as possible.</v>

2195
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>You want Santa to go as long as humanly</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2196
01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:12.880
<v Speaker 1>He wanted the Easter bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2197
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even nine 11.</v>

2198
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:19.970
<v Speaker 1>My kids don't know what nine 11 is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm keeping that race to racism.</v>

2199
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:21.830
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to know that that guy</v>

2200
01:35:21.831 --> 01:35:24.110
<v Speaker 1>has dark skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to know any of those</v>

2201
01:35:24.111 --> 01:35:26.420
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're living in a culture where</v>

2202
01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.720
<v Speaker 1>we're normalizing so much decadence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're destroying our own innocence in</v>

2203
01:35:32.151 --> 01:35:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strap yourself in for this 70% of all</v>

2204
01:35:36.321 --> 01:35:41.321
<v Speaker 1>Pakistanis are inbred and in Turkey the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount is between 25 to 30% more</v>

2205
01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:45.740
<v Speaker 1>stillbirths among immigrants.</v>

2206
01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 1>A rough estimate reveals that close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of everybody living in the Arab</v>

2207
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 1>world is inbred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A large percentage of the parents that</v>

2208
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:55.070
<v Speaker 1>this is blowing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Large percentage of the parents that are</v>

2209
01:35:55.071 --> 01:35:56.270
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this coming from?</v>

2210
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 1>What does this website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blog posted it before I came here.</v>

2211
01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:01.820
<v Speaker 1>He gave media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are all the sources that went</v>

2212
01:36:01.821 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 1>to this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sources reproductive health</v>

2213
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:05.420
<v Speaker 1>journal.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2214
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:07.730
<v Speaker 1>this is a BBC investigation that went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2215
01:36:07.731 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so listen to the BBC investigation in</v>

2216
01:36:09.651 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Britain several years ago revealed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 55% of the Pakistani community</v>

2217
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:16.280
<v Speaker 1>in Britain was married to a first</v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>

2218
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.050
<v Speaker 1>The Times of India from that in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is thought to be linked to</v>

2219
01:36:21.051 --> 01:36:25.010
<v Speaker 1>probability to the probability that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>British Pakistani family,</v>

2220
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.990
<v Speaker 1>British Pakistani family is at least 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>times more likely than the general</v>

2221
01:36:29.991 --> 01:36:34.220
<v Speaker 1>population to have children with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recessive genetic disorders.</v>

2222
01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bbcs research also discovered that while</v>

2223
01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:44.150
<v Speaker 1>British Pakistanis account for just</v>
<v Speaker 1>3.44% of all births in Britain,</v>

2224
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:49.420
<v Speaker 1>they accounted for 30% of all British</v>
<v Speaker 1>children with recessive disorders and a</v>

2225
01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:55.271
<v Speaker 1>higher rate of infant mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck Labour Party MP has</v>

2226
01:36:57.441 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 1>called for a ban on first cousin</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

2227
01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Medical evidence shows that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of inbreeding is a</v>

2228
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:07.781
<v Speaker 1>100% increase in the risk of stillbirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One study comparing the Norwegians and</v>

2229
01:37:08.361 --> 01:37:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan showed that the risk of child</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the child dying during Labor</v>

2230
01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:15.620
<v Speaker 1>increases by 50%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2231
01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.770
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also read somewhere that's a lot of</v>

2232
01:37:18.771 --> 01:37:23.771
<v Speaker 1>the symptoms of inbred people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational rage fanaticism and they end</v>

2233
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:31.220
<v Speaker 1>up just describing isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what it says here that um,</v>

2234
01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:32.450
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2235
01:37:32.451 --> 01:37:34.820
<v Speaker 1>the Iq points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says findings.</v>

2236
01:37:34.821 --> 01:37:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Unintelligence research shows that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>one parents are cousins,</v>

2237
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.310
<v Speaker 1>if one's parents or cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence goes down 10 to 16 Iq</v>

2238
01:37:43.311 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

2239
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:48.770
<v Speaker 1>The risk of having an Iq lower than 70</v>
<v Speaker 1>criterion for being retarded.</v>

2240
01:37:48.771 --> 01:37:50.720
<v Speaker 1>In quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they using that word,</v>

2241
01:37:51.190 --> 01:37:53.420
<v Speaker 1>who uses that word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use it like that.</v>

2242
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm noticing that you use like I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>always done it.</v>

2243
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

2244
01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:00.110
<v Speaker 1>This is a real website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck can we read it from?</v>

2245
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Did they say no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says retarded.</v>

2246
01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Retarded in quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a suit.</v>

2247
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Their legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the medical definition increases</v>

2248
01:38:07.591 --> 01:38:11.730
<v Speaker 1>400% among children from cousin</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages.</v>

2249
01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say that again.</v>

2250
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.840
<v Speaker 1>The risk of having an Iq lower than 70</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases 400% amongst children from</v>

2251
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 1>cousin marriages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An academic paper published in the</v>

2252
01:38:25.050 --> 01:38:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Indian National Science Academy found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the onset of various social</v>

2253
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:32.760
<v Speaker 1>profiles like visual fixation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social smile and sound seizures,</v>

2254
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:37.761
<v Speaker 1>oral expression in hand grasping are</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly delayed among the newborn</v>

2255
01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 1>inbred babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck could name for a band</v>

2256
01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.890
<v Speaker 1>newborn inbred babies?</v>

2257
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our punk or band.</v>

2258
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I ever heard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2259
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why don't we know this because I've</v>

2260
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 1>never don't like the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia.</v>

2261
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:55.660
<v Speaker 1>They don't like being called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia,</v>

2262
01:38:55.661 --> 01:38:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but even discussing it like we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be called Islamophobic for even</v>

2263
01:38:58.471 --> 01:39:00.510
<v Speaker 1>bringing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and I'm glad you read that from a</v>

2264
01:39:00.511 --> 01:39:03.780
<v Speaker 1>reputable site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a Joe Rogan and Gavin</v>

2265
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:06.810
<v Speaker 1>McInnes is called Muslims retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is PJ media.</v>

2266
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's find out if there's other</v>

2267
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.840
<v Speaker 1>corroborating or dissenting sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Pajama media is a,</v>

2268
01:39:15.081 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 1>a a well established network of</v>
<v Speaker 1>champions or what you wear when you want</v>

2269
01:39:19.231 --> 01:39:24.231
<v Speaker 1>to be serious about problems with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wear your footie pajamas and he</v>

2270
01:39:24.571 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 1>gets out of the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are scared of genetics too,</v>

2271
01:39:27.991 --> 01:39:30.270
<v Speaker 1>cause it gets into eugenics and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get uncomfortable,</v>

2272
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but it gets into racism too.</v>

2273
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I come from a Shitty Glaswegian family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my uncles were drunks and maybe</v>

2274
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:39.970
<v Speaker 1>coming from a shitty group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2275
01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you develop this immunity to fear of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your group sucking like,</v>

2276
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you say about roofs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm battalion mostly Italian.</v>

2277
01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm one quarter Irish and fucking I came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a line of savages.</v>

2278
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:53.070
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight people,</v>

2279
01:39:53.210 --> 01:39:56.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a good percentage of my ancestors</v>

2280
01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:59.930
<v Speaker 1>and relatives that I know that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ape people and I can say that</v>

2281
01:39:59.931 --> 01:40:03.550
<v Speaker 1>cause I know them and I come from them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have eight people instincts that I</v>

2282
01:40:03.551 --> 01:40:05.640
<v Speaker 1>fight off every goddamn day or my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2283
01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:08.610
<v Speaker 1>the first time I came here you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to separate your spinal cord</v>

2284
01:40:08.611 --> 01:40:10.590
<v Speaker 1>cause you had crushed it from choking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out.</v>

2285
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.180
<v Speaker 1>While I'm not trying to separate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to relax it and uh,</v>

2286
01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.790
<v Speaker 1>decompress it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sound like doctor Zay us right now,</v>

2287
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but I've worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

2288
01:40:19.651 --> 01:40:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I worked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2289
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Now my back works wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stretched out.</v>

2290
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.500
<v Speaker 1>My philosophy is I don't care what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is,</v>

2291
01:40:25.501 --> 01:40:27.980
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as hate fax to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear it.</v>

2292
01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking to the facts and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be uncomfortable for you,</v>

2293
01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 1>but they are facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and it's best for everyone.</v>

2294
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A surgeon recently and I,</v>

2295
01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:38.970
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to accrue a DNA database</v>

2296
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:42.600
<v Speaker 1>that would just sort of like going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the singularity,</v>

2297
01:40:42.601 --> 01:40:47.370
<v Speaker 1>it would be like becoming God and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be able to tell from a baby if a</v>

2298
01:40:47.371 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 1>baby is going to have a propensity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>lung cancer and you know right out of</v>

2299
01:40:50.521 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 1>the gate and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's scared of this concept</v>

2300
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.670
<v Speaker 2>because he's worried it will affect</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance policies.</v>

2301
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 2>They'll demand to see ya a smear some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your spit and they'll go,</v>

2302
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:03.050
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not insuring you.</v>

2303
01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.360
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a 40% chance of prostate cancer</v>

2304
01:41:05.361 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 2>and 50% chance of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of insurance.</v>

2305
01:41:08.291 --> 01:41:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause then insurance gets real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a gamble anymore.</v>

2306
01:41:10.781 --> 01:41:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could see the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2307
01:41:12.101 --> 01:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>let me see your cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2308
01:41:13.121 --> 01:41:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2309
01:41:14.581 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2310
01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's just a bank account.</v>

2311
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that kind of what insurance is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2312
01:41:18.461 --> 01:41:20.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like I look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Gavin,</v>

2313
01:41:20.111 --> 01:41:21.700
<v Speaker 2>let me take your blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2314
01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:23.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2315
01:41:23.181 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 2>a cough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2316
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:27.580
<v Speaker 2>let me hit your knee with this little</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber mallet.</v>

2317
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Everything seems okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2318
01:41:29.621 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 2>how are you sleeping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeping pretty good.</v>

2319
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:32.291
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2320
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you a positive checkup</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you bring it to the insurance</v>

2321
01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:35.771
<v Speaker 2>company and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2322
01:41:35.771 --> 01:41:36.604
<v Speaker 2>everything checks out.</v>

2323
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.660
<v Speaker 2>You're going to insure me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2324
01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2325
01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:41.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is taking a chance.</v>

2326
01:41:41.141 --> 01:41:42.310
<v Speaker 2>But do you smoke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2327
01:41:42.311 --> 01:41:45.190
<v Speaker 2>you smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like my odds there.</v>

2328
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Do Drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like my odds.</v>

2329
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we're getting smarter,</v>

2330
01:41:48.701 --> 01:41:51.190
<v Speaker 2>we're turning into those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those chicks in the hot tub,</v>

2331
01:41:51.191 --> 01:41:53.860
<v Speaker 2>in minority report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sooner be able to just go,</v>

2332
01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't and chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2333
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:58.990
<v Speaker 2>you're dying on the way home today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2334
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2335
01:42:00.161 --> 01:42:01.810
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get it out there.</v>

2336
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 2>The free market will figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance for the doomed,</v>

2337
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of catastrophic policy,</v>

2338
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:09.580
<v Speaker 2>but there'll be more money over here to</v>
<v Speaker 2>even it out.</v>

2339
01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Information has to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need this information.</v>

2340
01:42:13.181 --> 01:42:15.430
<v Speaker 2>But inbreeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it explains the hijacking of,</v>

2341
01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:16.690
<v Speaker 2>of Muslim religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2342
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Hasidic Jews have the same problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

2343
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:21.280
<v Speaker 2>because they're aware of this and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth is out.</v>

2344
01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.400
<v Speaker 2>They have all kinds of elaborate DNA</v>
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>

2345
01:42:24.401 --> 01:42:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They do on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone takes it,</v>

2346
01:42:26.231 --> 01:42:29.110
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rabbis will encourage this for us to</v>

2347
01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:31.580
<v Speaker 2>check you out and make sure you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>related and encourage this marriage</v>

2348
01:42:31.581 --> 01:42:34.220
<v Speaker 2>because it makes the most genetic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea you,</v>

2349
01:42:34.221 --> 01:42:36.500
<v Speaker 2>you blew my mind with that information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2350
01:42:36.501 --> 01:42:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that Jamie's going to pull up</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that shows that that's a right</v>

2351
01:42:39.551 --> 01:42:43.690
<v Speaker 2>wing hate group that's infiltrated this</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics and there does seem to come</v>

2352
01:42:43.691 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of right wing websites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find more sources,</v>

2353
01:42:46.181 --> 01:42:49.030
<v Speaker 2>but trying to find another source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just try to find another source and</v>

2354
01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.220
<v Speaker 2>we'll continue to talk about other</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic things.</v>

2355
01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you aware of Crispr?</v>

2356
01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some crazy shit and they've,</v>

2357
01:42:56.201 --> 01:42:59.350
<v Speaker 2>they've been given the green light to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead and start working on human</v>

2358
01:42:59.351 --> 01:43:00.184
<v Speaker 2>fetuses.</v>

2359
01:43:00.670 --> 01:43:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I actually had this crazy theory in</v>
<v Speaker 2>church the other day where I thought,</v>

2360
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:07.660
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that we're in heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2361
01:43:07.661 --> 01:43:11.290
<v Speaker 2>you know how the concept of Heaven is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfathomable,</v>

2362
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's totally different</v>

2363
01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:16.480
<v Speaker 2>from where we are now and it's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite universe thing that our brains</v>

2364
01:43:16.481 --> 01:43:17.980
<v Speaker 2>can't handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was thinking,</v>

2365
01:43:17.981 --> 01:43:20.650
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sounds like a sperm trying to</v>

2366
01:43:20.651 --> 01:43:22.950
<v Speaker 2>figure out what earth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2367
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the sperm was us being born was</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

2368
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Now we're alive here on heaven and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly getting closer and closer to</v>

2369
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:35.320
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean lifespan has been getting better.</v>

2370
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:37.180
<v Speaker 2>The quality of life has been getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2371
01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:41.590
<v Speaker 2>We're going to die soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in like 50 generations with crispers</v>

2372
01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 2>and all this incredible genetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2373
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 2>soon we might be able to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all is.</v>

2374
01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Usually we have cured your liver</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancers.</v>

2375
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Well it's going to get really weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're kind of be able</v>

2376
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 1>to integrate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human beings that are here today</v>

2377
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:59.270
<v Speaker 1>with not just communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just visual information,</v>

2378
01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but some sort of computer language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I were just talking about this</v>

2379
01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 1>yesterday where we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>emojis and you know,</v>

2380
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:08.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up before.</v>

2381
01:44:09.010 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 1>The emojis are in many ways a lot like</v>
<v Speaker 1>hieroglyphs and that they,</v>

2382
01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you can say something with emojis that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can kind of translate what you're</v>

2383
01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:23.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking without an actual language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're saying we're going to get down</v>

2384
01:44:23.781 --> 01:44:26.630
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only words you say are like yes and</v>

2385
01:44:26.631 --> 01:44:27.500
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah.</v>

2386
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:32.501
<v Speaker 1>And know like nods and affirmations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmations and the,</v>

2387
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the language that we speak could be some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a weird universal emoji based</v>

2388
01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:43.481
<v Speaker 1>language that's just expressed from mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mind through some neural implants or</v>

2389
01:44:43.761 --> 01:44:46.220
<v Speaker 1>some fucking snapchat glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

2390
01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not too far away from something</v>

2391
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:50.450
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre and paradigm shifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2392
01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I remember when downloading your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just science fiction movies and you</v>

2393
01:44:54.441 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk to people our age about their</v>

2394
01:44:56.631 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 1>dead grandfather and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this black and my photo and I</v>

2395
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:04.910
<v Speaker 1>have this letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote the newspaper in 1896 that's</v>

2396
01:45:04.911 --> 01:45:08.600
<v Speaker 1>all I got my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids will never be able to read all</v>

2397
01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:11.270
<v Speaker 1>the articles I've written or watch all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the videos I've done.</v>

2398
01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:12.620
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll never get through them all.</v>

2399
01:45:12.621 --> 01:45:15.260
<v Speaker 1>They can watch them for 100 hours if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bored.</v>

2400
01:45:15.261 --> 01:45:18.620
<v Speaker 1>But they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's way more of my brain permanently</v>

2401
01:45:18.621 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 1>out there in the cosmos than they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever want.</v>

2402
01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure is and everything.</v>

2403
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:27.780
<v Speaker 1>So the next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad isn't really going to die and</v>

2404
01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:29.720
<v Speaker 1>just hang out with them whenever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2405
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of Ray Kurzwell</v>

2406
01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:36.410
<v Speaker 1>and you know Kurzweil's thing is that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to somehow or another recreate his</v>

2407
01:45:36.411 --> 01:45:41.411
<v Speaker 1>father cause his father died when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>young and he has some information about</v>

2408
01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:48.020
<v Speaker 1>his father and he has some DNA that</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously is his and he has,</v>

2409
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs and memories and he wants to</v>

2410
01:45:51.171 --> 01:45:55.430
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to literally recreate</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father and have a conversation with</v>

2411
01:45:55.431 --> 01:45:57.890
<v Speaker 1>them that I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're an atheist,</v>

2412
01:45:57.891 --> 01:45:58.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2413
01:45:58.370 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I am a nothing.</v>

2414
01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.330
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

2415
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of atheists where he</v>

2416
01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:06.620
<v Speaker 1>drinks that thing and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorates and goes into the water.</v>

2417
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:10.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think the big bang was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this beautiful microchip that</v>

2418
01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 1>just started the first domino and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

2419
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:17.180
<v Speaker 1>He's going to this place like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity is near this incredible</v>

2420
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:20.750
<v Speaker 1>perfection that we're headed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's all these checks and</v>

2421
01:46:20.751 --> 01:46:22.820
<v Speaker 1>balances along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was reading about Audrey Hepburn</v>

2422
01:46:22.821 --> 01:46:25.280
<v Speaker 1>the other day and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2423
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.860
<v Speaker 1>was super skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right breakfast at tiffany's chick.</v>

2424
01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.660
<v Speaker 1>She grew up in I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2425
01:46:29.661 --> 01:46:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2426
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Holland during the war and the Nazis</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cutoff Holland from all supplies.</v>

2427
01:46:35.511 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 1>So they were forced to eat lips and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2428
01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:40.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of them starve to</v>

2429
01:46:40.581 --> 01:46:44.180
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Audrey Hepburn was from that world</v>

2430
01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:46.760
<v Speaker 1>and she was a skinny chick who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>need a lot of food.</v>

2431
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And then all of her ancestors kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>became obese,</v>

2432
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.450
<v Speaker 1>big giant fat pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say it could have been genetic</v>

2433
01:46:57.451 --> 01:47:00.720
<v Speaker 1>memory where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies went,</v>

2434
01:47:00.721 --> 01:47:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found Doritos.</v>

2435
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hold onto this cause you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>never gonna find one again.</v>

2436
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And then you get an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm noticing this in La with all</v>

2437
01:47:08.161 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 1>these Mexicans I see everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem more obese than the general</v>

2438
01:47:12.631 --> 01:47:15.000
<v Speaker 1>populace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they have genetic memory</v>

2439
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.020
<v Speaker 1>from a generation or two ago where food</v>
<v Speaker 1>was scarce and they,</v>

2440
01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 1>their bodies hold onto it more</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly.</v>

2441
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 1>We see this with the American Indians</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2442
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:27.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a major diabetes problems send its</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic memory where these are the</v>

2443
01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:30.660
<v Speaker 1>checks and balances your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at the fact that a cell can</v>

2444
01:47:30.661 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 1>remember this generation is like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever heard cell memory where the you get</v>

2445
01:47:34.951 --> 01:47:37.920
<v Speaker 1>an eye transplant and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing the guy that killed that</v>

2446
01:47:37.921 --> 01:47:38.754
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2447
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I've heard stories and out but I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if it's ever been proven and it's</v>

2448
01:47:42.391 --> 01:47:44.640
<v Speaker 1>still in the got to look it up to prefer</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain.</v>

2449
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:48.210
<v Speaker 1>People getting organ transplants as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have hungers,</v>

2450
01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.470
<v Speaker 1>like they have a hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunger pangs for something that they</v>

2451
01:47:52.471 --> 01:47:54.270
<v Speaker 1>never craved before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2452
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2453
01:47:56.010 --> 01:47:59.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not known as big foot shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is known as as a,</v>

2454
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know genetic memory is a real</v>

2455
01:48:02.671 --> 01:48:06.450
<v Speaker 1>thing and I just see all of this as part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bigger picture as we,</v>

2456
01:48:06.650 --> 01:48:08.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking balance ourselves,</v>

2457
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.760
<v Speaker 1>constantly improving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the left seems to always deny that,</v>

2458
01:48:11.761 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 1>that there's this 45 degree line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the stock market,</v>

2459
01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 1>if you invested right before the Great</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression and you had the patience to</v>

2460
01:48:18.181 --> 01:48:19.950
<v Speaker 1>wait 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still would have been up.</v>

2461
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:22.650
<v Speaker 1>So all the dips we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been improving,</v>

2462
01:48:22.651 --> 01:48:23.490
<v Speaker 1>improving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving,</v>

2463
01:48:23.491 --> 01:48:24.150
<v Speaker 1>improving.</v>

2464
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely some memories</v>

2465
01:48:26.161 --> 01:48:30.780
<v Speaker 1>that are passed on between parents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and they're trying to figure</v>

2466
01:48:30.781 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 1>out exactly what's the mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't know.</v>

2467
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:36.600
<v Speaker 1>What they do know is that they've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>these studies with mice and it's really</v>

2468
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:39.570
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take mice and they put them in this</v>

2469
01:48:39.571 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 1>cage that has a floor that they can give</v>
<v Speaker 1>an electric shock to it.</v>

2470
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And then they release a citrus smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nice smell,</v>

2471
01:48:45.551 --> 01:48:47.040
<v Speaker 1>the citrus smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they zap them.</v>

2472
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:50.940
<v Speaker 1>So these APP their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then these mice have children.</v>

2473
01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:53.670
<v Speaker 1>The children have never had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience before.</v>

2474
01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 1>The children are the grow to full size</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they spray the citrus smell and</v>

2475
01:48:58.621 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 1>they fucking panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

2476
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.080
<v Speaker 1>They've never been zapped before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they fucking panicked.</v>

2477
01:49:03.081 --> 01:49:04.830
<v Speaker 1>They have an immediate reaction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2478
01:49:04.831 --> 01:49:05.611
<v Speaker 1>when I hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2479
01:49:05.611 --> 01:49:06.810
<v Speaker 1>how can people not believe in God?</v>

2480
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:07.471
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2481
01:49:07.471 --> 01:49:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a god thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a learned reaction to</v>

2482
01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:13.950
<v Speaker 1>genetics that passed on from parent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

2483
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:18.150
<v Speaker 1>That is the reason for instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So reason why we have the rational fee</v>

2484
01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:21.330
<v Speaker 1>is magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of mad at me for what is that</v>

2485
01:49:21.331 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 1>magic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2486
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:24.420
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the universe itself?</v>

2487
01:49:24.450 --> 01:49:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the magic that makes you see me?</v>

2488
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:28.830
<v Speaker 1>What does the magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does God,</v>

2489
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a weird limited expression</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to sort of make some sense out of</v>

2490
01:49:35.131 --> 01:49:38.730
<v Speaker 1>something that's beyond our feeble mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and imagination at this point.</v>

2491
01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's necessarily,</v>

2492
01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:43.260
<v Speaker 1>there was an article going around about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month ago where they said,</v>

2493
01:49:43.261 --> 01:49:46.470
<v Speaker 1>we may all be in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could all be some sort of giant</v>

2494
01:49:46.471 --> 01:49:48.790
<v Speaker 1>experiment and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go wait.</v>

2495
01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:52.060
<v Speaker 1>It had to have discovered God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

2496
01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first domino.</v>

2497
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:57.220
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machine about God.</v>

2498
01:49:57.221 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about a guy who lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the clouds with a harp trying to get</v>

2499
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:01.240
<v Speaker 1>a grip on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2500
01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.300
<v Speaker 1>That says drawing a face on the guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean our meager of this whole sperm to</v>

2513
01:50:46.631 --> 01:50:51.310
<v Speaker 1>human thing because the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship I can see in front of me,</v>

2514
01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:55.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mimics this is a pilot is kind of</v>

2515
01:50:55.390 --> 01:50:57.660
<v Speaker 1>human being we're the pilot is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2516
01:50:57.661 --> 01:51:01.120
<v Speaker 1>So if you said to a sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is this earth man like?</v>

2517
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:02.920

<v Speaker 1>those aren't words,</v>

2519
01:51:09.431 --> 01:51:12.540
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that like when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say something as God or you believe,</v>

2520
01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you say you believe in God what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're defining something but you don't</v>

2521
01:51:17.501 --> 01:51:19.720
<v Speaker 1>even know what you're defining</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude.</v>

2522
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>You go to church and it's just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverence and thank God that I'm here</v>

2523
01:51:24.551 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and I really appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Latin mass.</v>

2524
01:51:27.371 --> 01:51:32.350
<v Speaker 1>You go to Latin mass and it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like I don't know what</v>

2525
01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:34.120
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in this incredible building.</v>

2526
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.370
<v Speaker 1>It's blown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Milo,</v>

2527
01:51:36.371 --> 01:51:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but at once when he was last in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

2528
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How good to these churches are.</v>

2529
01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Like how beautiful there do you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when the,</v>

2530
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.020
<v Speaker 1>the the guy that the contractors were</v>
<v Speaker 1>making them like the stained glass,</v>

2531
01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.470
<v Speaker 1>it was like they're on adderall and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had this sort of divine intervention and</v>

2532
01:51:50.471 --> 01:51:51.251
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>

2533
01:51:51.251 --> 01:51:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm really good today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2534
01:51:53.861 --> 01:51:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't leave a weld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's carvings turning out.</v>

2535
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Have you been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's described you've been to Rome.</v>

2536
01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to the Vatican?</v>

2537
01:52:00.850 --> 01:52:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2538
01:52:01.691 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I think we went up to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if we went in or not.</v>

2539
01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh God man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

2540
01:52:05.321 --> 01:52:09.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk about something that'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow your mind as far as like the</v>

2541
01:52:09.161 --> 01:52:14.161
<v Speaker 1>religious undertones and the majestic</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnificence of its construction.</v>

2542
01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:18.550
<v Speaker 1>St Peter's Basilica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

2543
01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:20.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole Vatican is incredible.</v>

2544
01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:22.570
<v Speaker 1>The artwork is just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2545
01:52:22.571 --> 01:52:24.590
<v Speaker 1>were there for hours and hours wandering</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2546
01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:27.980
<v Speaker 1>We had this really cool professor we</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired as a guide.</v>

2547
01:52:27.981 --> 01:52:30.370
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told us all the history of</v>

2548
01:52:30.371 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you get to St Peter's basilica</v>

2549
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and he was explaining how many hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years it took to build and they're</v>

2550
01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:38.740
<v Speaker 1>building all this shit with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>

2551
01:52:38.741 --> 01:52:40.360
<v Speaker 1>no machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

2552
01:52:40.361 --> 01:52:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Everything is massive and perfect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

2553
01:52:42.791 --> 01:52:47.791
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're looking at such an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible work of art that's designed</v>

2554
01:52:48.891 --> 01:52:53.891
<v Speaker 1>to inspire awe and reverence and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation behind building something</v>

2555
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:56.320
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking hundreds of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2556
01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.970
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gratitude and you see this</v>

2557
01:52:58.971 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 1>with my wife's American Indian and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those ceremonies.</v>

2558
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we give things to the north.</v>

2559
01:53:03.771 --> 01:53:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We give thanks to the West.</v>

2560
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 1>We give thanks to the east and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what church is.</v>

2561
01:53:07.611 --> 01:53:09.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the details,</v>

2562
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:12.320
<v Speaker 1>but thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While my hands work,</v>

2563
01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:15.050
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pray for other people.</v>

2564
01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a great way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is living life with gratitude and I</v>

2565
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:22.130
<v Speaker 1>try to be thankful all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very lucky person and I've always</v>

2566
01:53:22.131 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 1>been very lucky and I'm always very</v>
<v Speaker 1>thankful to and I try to be very</v>

2567
01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:26.960
<v Speaker 1>generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be very thankful,</v>

2568
01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:30.860
<v Speaker 1>try to be friendly as much as I can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things I think sort of build</v>

2569
01:53:30.861 --> 01:53:34.640
<v Speaker 1>onto it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have it and define it and to put</v>

2570
01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:38.680
<v Speaker 1>it into like a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where things can get awry because</v>

2571
01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:41.000
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get screwy when you're sort of</v>

2572
01:53:41.001 --> 01:53:44.300
<v Speaker 1>defining things by this ancient set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

2573
01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:47.300
<v Speaker 1>That was sort of established before we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really understood science before we</v>

2574
01:53:47.301 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 1>really understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2575
01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws of thermodynamics,</v>

2576
01:53:51.411 --> 01:53:54.800
<v Speaker 1>the way the universe is formed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we know now about the cosmos,</v>

2577
01:53:54.801 --> 01:53:57.710
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many variables that have to</v>

2578
01:53:57.711 --> 01:54:00.950
<v Speaker 1>be taken into account when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at an entire system,</v>

2579
01:54:01.130 --> 01:54:05.360
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to define what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what God is and what religion is,</v>

2580
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at how restrictive</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion has been in the past and how</v>

2581
01:54:09.561 --> 01:54:14.561
<v Speaker 1>many people have suffered because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries that they had didn't jive</v>

2582
01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:18.540
<v Speaker 1>with the ancient texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He mean like Galileo and sure.</v>

2583
01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Catholic Church was,</v>

2584
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:26.810
<v Speaker 1>is very pro science and has been pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>science for a long time.</v>

2585
01:54:26.811 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So as the Islamic church for the longest</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2586
01:54:29.541 --> 01:54:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Islam was like the foundation of science</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the foundation of literature.</v>

2587
01:54:32.811 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Like before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2588
01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:37.400
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Gaviscon came riding into Iraq</v>

2589
01:54:37.401 --> 01:54:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and fucked up uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad and turned the river red with</v>

2590
01:54:41.511 --> 01:54:46.280
<v Speaker 1>blood and black with ink as they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were some of the best scholars</v>

2591
01:54:46.281 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

2592
01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 1>It was like some of the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics,</v>

2593
01:54:48.561 --> 01:54:49.490
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2594
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best writing.</v>

2595
01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 1>It had come out of the Islamic world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had been conquered and destroyed.</v>

2596
01:54:54.861 --> 01:54:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And so much of that was lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2597
01:54:56.751 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 1>the ebb and flow of these cultures to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like such a long time to go from</v>

2598
01:55:01.371 --> 01:55:06.320
<v Speaker 1>1200 to 2017 but in the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

2599
01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:08.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a blip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nothing.</v>

2600
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe gays should be thrown off</v>

2601
01:55:10.491 --> 01:55:12.290
<v Speaker 1>buildings to pick scientifically proved</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2602
01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a lot of these rape victims are</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches that it should have stones</v>

2603
01:55:15.411 --> 01:55:17.900
<v Speaker 1>thrown in the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>

2604
01:55:17.901 --> 01:55:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't kid,</v>

2605
01:55:19.641 --> 01:55:21.730
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things you can't kit</v>

2606
01:55:21.731 --> 01:55:23.840
<v Speaker 1>about Gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it has allowed,</v>

2607
01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:28.760
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the whole Catholic versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestant things goes back to,</v>

2608
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:32.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate core of all arguments,</v>

2609
01:55:32.210 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>which is nature versus nurture.</v>

2610
01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And the Catholics say some people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than others.</v>

2611
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Some people are special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Protestants say we're all the same.</v>

2612
01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

2613
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 1>the guy up there on that pedestal isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2614
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And I vacillate myself like you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

2615
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:52.320
<v Speaker 1>are you special?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you magic?</v>

2616
01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you blessed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're on that show why your career</v>

2617
01:55:57.001 --> 01:55:59.670
<v Speaker 1>has been so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like every time you get thrown</v>

2618
01:55:59.671 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 1>out of a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come back a few days later and you've</v>

2619
01:56:02.071 --> 01:56:04.260
<v Speaker 1>got a coconut stand and you're wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass skirt and you're like,</v>

2620
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:05.123
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>

2621
01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.380
<v Speaker 1>These are where everyone sits for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2622
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 1>their coconut juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2623
01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you were kind of the Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism seems to say that you're a</v>

2624
01:56:16.951 --> 01:56:19.800
<v Speaker 1>chosen one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's some people who are picked</v>

2625
01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 1>by God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that Davinci code thing with Tom</v>

2626
01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Hanks where some people are just way</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than others.</v>

2627
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I was having dinner with Sean</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon,</v>

2628
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:27.840
<v Speaker 1>but you got to get them on the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting guys I've ever met in my</v>

2630
01:56:29.851 --> 01:56:31.200
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

2631
01:56:31.201 --> 01:56:34.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a mason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him and Vincent Gallo are masons and</v>

2632
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 1>during one of his Doo Hickey's hope he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mind me telling this,</v>

2633
01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but there were these like it's so no</v>
<v Speaker 1>snow to roll.</v>

2634
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking through like a wood</v>

2635
01:56:42.031 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>thing and they invited him to the heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2636
01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:49.320
<v Speaker 1>One that's like made a golden is through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book where you go upside down and you</v>

2637
01:56:49.321 --> 01:56:53.040
<v Speaker 1>have to swim there and you've come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your workload and your hold like a</v>

2638
01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:55.590
<v Speaker 1>diamond sword or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just making that up.</v>

2639
01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super fancy one and he's like,</v>

2640
01:56:57.691 --> 01:56:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it because that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like doing that.</v>

2641
01:56:59.851 --> 01:57:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go to the fancy one.</v>

2642
01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to be with my boys and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking later you have a,</v>

2643
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:09.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe you are that Ans Davinci code</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

2644
01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Well this is my take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely nature and</v>

2645
01:57:12.991 --> 01:57:15.720
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think both are factors and to go</v>

2646
01:57:15.721 --> 01:57:18.030
<v Speaker 1>nature versus nurture to me seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

2647
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems too simplistic.</v>

2648
01:57:20.221 --> 01:57:23.130
<v Speaker 1>It seems too silly because it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me like your,</v>

2649
01:57:23.190 --> 01:57:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to pick a side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're clearly both have massive amounts</v>

2650
01:57:27.481 --> 01:57:29.280
<v Speaker 1>of animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to percentages and I think</v>

2651
01:57:29.281 --> 01:57:31.040
<v Speaker 1>they've discovered the frontal lobe</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it,</v>

2652
01:57:31.041 --> 01:57:35.070
<v Speaker 1>everything matters is 80 nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 nurture.</v>

2653
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And we see this with identical twins</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated at birth.</v>

2654
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.140
<v Speaker 1>One grew up rich and Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:57:39.141 --> 01:57:42.090
<v Speaker 1>There was poor in Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar dogs.</v>

2656
01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Husbands looked the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same car.</v>

2657
01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:47.370
<v Speaker 1>One does film critic critiques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other makes movies.</v>

2658
01:57:47.371 --> 01:57:50.400
<v Speaker 1>She's aligned producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are basically the same person.</v>

2659
01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely gifts,</v>

2660
01:57:53.551 --> 01:57:55.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are intellectually gifted</v>

2661
01:57:55.690 --> 01:57:57.870
<v Speaker 1>when we know people that are just really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking smart.</v>

2662
01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:00.540
<v Speaker 1>They're just born really fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smarter than me.</v>

2663
01:58:00.541 --> 01:58:01.351
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2664
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletically gifted like Michael Jordan.</v>

2666
01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's not,</v>

2667
01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:10.890
<v Speaker 1>there's not a chance in hell like a take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Jonah Hill.</v>

2668
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Jonah Hill could work every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Day for the rest of his fucking</v>

2669
01:58:15.931 --> 01:58:17.520
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to play basketball like</v>

2670
01:58:17.521 --> 01:58:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is impossible if Michael Jordan never</v>

2671
01:58:20.821 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 1>worked out ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like never,</v>

2672
01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:26.880
<v Speaker 1>like literally just kind of did normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like everybody else does.</v>

2673
01:58:26.881 --> 01:58:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Like man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the gym,</v>

2674
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:31.410
<v Speaker 1>took a spin class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could probably jump way fucking</v>

2675
01:58:31.411 --> 01:58:34.260
<v Speaker 1>higher than Jonah Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could probably run way faster than</v>

2676
01:58:34.261 --> 01:58:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Jonah Hill and he probably would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at anything he applied himself to</v>

2677
01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:40.590
<v Speaker 1>athletically because he's got a gift.</v>

2678
01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:43.540
<v Speaker 1>He's get clearly genetically gifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2679
01:58:43.541 --> 01:58:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same could be said of Karl</v>

2680
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Malone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same could be said of Mike Tyson.</v>

2681
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 1>The same could be said of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of great athletes.</v>

2682
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same could be said of Brock Lesnar.</v>

2683
01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:54.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do,</v>

2684
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you can lift weights all your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2685
01:58:55.990 --> 01:59:00.070
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to be as strong as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy who was the mountain drew thorn</v>

2686
01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.170
<v Speaker 1>was named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be Orson or whatever the fuck his</v>

2687
01:59:02.171 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 1>name is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gigantic mountain dew guy from game</v>

2688
01:59:04.601 --> 01:59:06.320
<v Speaker 1>of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a gift,</v>

2689
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:09.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's gifted 100% and I'm glad you</v>

2690
01:59:09.941 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 1>use sports as an analogy because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>general understanding is there's this</v>

2691
01:59:13.391 --> 01:59:18.100
<v Speaker 1>sort of line and it's a gray area and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy who can throw a softball,</v>

2692
01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:22.330
<v Speaker 1>a fast ball at 10 miles an hour or 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour and it goes up to 100 and</v>

2693
01:59:22.331 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 1>then there's a guy who can do 99 98 but</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works like that with</v>

2694
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:26.530
<v Speaker 1>baseball.</v>

2695
01:59:26.530 --> 01:59:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like the 40 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour people and then there's this</v>

2696
01:59:30.371 --> 01:59:35.371
<v Speaker 1>floating bubble of the hundred mile an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour pitchers and these guys are magic.</v>

2697
01:59:35.441 --> 01:59:37.450
<v Speaker 1>They are very special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the Davinci code.</v>

2698
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Children of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in fight and fighting in striking</v>

2699
01:59:41.891 --> 01:59:43.750
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

2700
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:45.580
<v Speaker 1>well there it exists in grappling as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2701
01:59:45.581 --> 01:59:47.740
<v Speaker 1>There's strength and grappling that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some people who have just</v>

2702
01:59:47.741 --> 01:59:49.870
<v Speaker 1>freak strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that that could be</v>

2703
01:59:49.871 --> 01:59:54.430
<v Speaker 1>nurtured more than striking strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>people when people are good hitters</v>

2704
01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Stryker's like a guys who are power</v>
<v Speaker 1>punchers empower power kickers.</v>

2705
01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 1>There's only so much you can teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

2706
02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You could teach someone proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

2707
02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:06.820
<v Speaker 1>but power is something that's just given</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you by the great beyond and no one</v>

2708
02:00:06.821 --> 02:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows why you could take two</v>

2709
02:00:09.191 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them looks exactly like the other</v>

2710
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're built the same.</v>

2711
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>They're both have big muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both have big hands and one of them</v>

2712
02:00:17.561 --> 02:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>can punch a hole through the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and the other one could barely</v>

2713
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>make the bag move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense and no one</v>

2714
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>knows why you could take someone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body looks completely</v>

2715
02:00:28.031 --> 02:00:29.920
<v Speaker 1>unimpressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they hit people,</v>

2716
02:00:29.921 --> 02:00:32.350
<v Speaker 1>people just go flat and no one knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

2717
02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:32.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2718
02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe transfer that hard truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to intellect.</v>

2719
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this myth that we all need to be</v>

2720
02:00:38.621 --> 02:00:39.940
<v Speaker 1>educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have to go to college.</v>

2721
02:00:39.970 --> 02:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>When my dad was young and Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did your old levels at 13 and my dad</v>

2722
02:00:44.321 --> 02:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>had a high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brothers didn't.</v>

2723
02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So they sifted through just like a pink</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd video and they sifted him over to</v>

2724
02:00:49.811 --> 02:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>a scholarship and private school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sit at his brother's over to work</v>

2725
02:00:52.671 --> 02:00:53.504
<v Speaker 1>in a printing press.</v>

2726
02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>And they all did fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had good jobs and they were,</v>

2727
02:00:57.490 --> 02:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>they were taking advantage of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills and then we came with this idea</v>

2728
02:01:01.001 --> 02:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>where everyone had to go to college and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now to lower the bar so everyone can get</v>

2729
02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all these retarded classes.</v>

2730
02:01:06.850 --> 02:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a class at Nyu called 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>something where it's just about being 20</v>

2731
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>something</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

2732
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone there is 20 something and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go now you've just wasted your time by</v>

2733
02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>not admitting that some people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>special and that's what I was getting at</v>

2734
02:01:21.161 --> 02:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>earlier with the Western culture thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some cultures are better,</v>

2735
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>some are more advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a satellite of people</v>

2736
02:01:27.911 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>that are just magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jimmy Kimmel.</v>

2737
02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>He kept having his career shadowing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in sports radio.</v>

2738
02:01:33.551 --> 02:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>We had this woman above him was out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sabotage him.</v>

2739
02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>He got sent down the shitter.</v>

2740
02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it was.</v>

2741
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I heard that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that about?</v>

2742
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Asking him about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some horrible con that tortured him</v>

2743
02:01:43.791 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>every day and producer or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2744
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so talented though.</v>

2745
02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I said that's what I'm</v>

2746
02:01:49.491 --> 02:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Michael Jordan,</v>

2747
02:01:51.201 --> 02:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you throw them in Africa and there would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

2748
02:01:53.391 --> 02:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>there'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to meet this man who is in</v>

2749
02:01:55.821 --> 02:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got jump on Minnie and miles.</v>

2750
02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.860
<v Speaker 1>His name is Juju or Jordan and he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a leather basketball and I don't</v>

2751
02:02:03.861 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am so good at this.</v>

2752
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>He would be flown over like Jeremy Lin</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever and I think Jimmy Kimmel and</v>

2753
02:02:09.471 --> 02:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2754
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>they get fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it a million times.</v>

2755
02:02:12.651 --> 02:02:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I've thrown my career down the toilet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I just keep flying through the</v>

2756
02:02:15.951 --> 02:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>sewers and pup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come out of another man hole.</v>

2757
02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Well you figured out a way now</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with your show to let your</v>

2758
02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:28.040
<v Speaker 1>personality shine through like to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your unique way of looking at things.</v>

2759
02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Very thorough examination of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you in an honest take on and that</v>

2760
02:02:32.730 --> 02:02:35.030
<v Speaker 1>also happens to be humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did that with advertising.</v>

2761
02:02:35.031 --> 02:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I got involved in advertising</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising agency.</v>

2762
02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:42.100
<v Speaker 1>He sold it for millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we got fired cause I said shitty</v>

2763
02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:45.970
<v Speaker 1>stuff about trainees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out they're mentally ill gaze.</v>

2764
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you pointed out was that there's a</v>

2765
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>lot of regret and that was where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were getting really uncomfortable.</v>

2766
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a website,</v>

2767
02:02:54.381 --> 02:02:59.381
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender regret.com and there you cannot</v>

2768
02:02:59.871 --> 02:03:04.430
<v Speaker 1>tell me that any sort of major surgery</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't carry some sort of regret.</v>

2769
02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:07.100
<v Speaker 1>When I was in my twenties I had hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>transplants.</v>

2770
02:03:07.101 --> 02:03:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I have a big scar on the back of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2771
02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:10.340
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2772
02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>That's because they take a piece of meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the back of your head with hair on</v>

2773
02:03:14.091 --> 02:03:16.040
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my hair was falling out and I</v>

2774
02:03:16.041 --> 02:03:17.870
<v Speaker 1>was on TV and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2775
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.970
<v Speaker 1>if my looks go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be poor again.</v>

2776
02:03:19.971 --> 02:03:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing my screen's radio.</v>

2777
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2778
02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And so a while we were on hiatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had hair transplants.</v>

2779
02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:29.510
<v Speaker 1>They take a piece of meat back here with</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the hair and they move it all up in</v>

2780
02:03:29.511 --> 02:03:30.680
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way I just,</v>

2781
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work because eventually the</v>

2782
02:03:32.841 --> 02:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>other hair falls out and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you left with this mess.</v>

2783
02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I regretted it.</v>

2784
02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a stupid thing to do and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>make irrational choices that can become</v>

2785
02:03:43.131 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>permanent and if you don't think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who decide that they would</v>

2786
02:03:47.331 --> 02:03:51.620
<v Speaker 1>be happier as a woman and then become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and then are miserable because</v>

2787
02:03:51.621 --> 02:03:53.780
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hormonal profile has changed.</v>

2788
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a penis anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have their testicles anymore.</v>

2789
02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 1>They wish they could go back to where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

2790
02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those people who have major surgery</v>

2791
02:04:01.851 --> 02:04:06.320
<v Speaker 1>could also possibly have major regret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is debt is dishonest,</v>

2792
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>it's disingenuous and you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are adhering to an ideology rather</v>

2793
02:04:12.561 --> 02:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>than looking at something in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely objective and and,</v>

2794
02:04:17.131 --> 02:04:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and open and honest way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2795
02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you're using these people as pawns for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own virtue signaling and it's</v>

2796
02:04:23.361 --> 02:04:25.310
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you see toddlers,</v>

2797
02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:28.160
<v Speaker 1>like at that woman's March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had these toddlers thing with my</v>

2798
02:04:28.161 --> 02:04:30.740
<v Speaker 1>pussy grabs back and you're looking at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old and you're going,</v>

2799
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's child abuse.</v>

2800
02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these liberals are doing tranny abuse by</v>

2801
02:04:35.691 --> 02:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>normalizing such a drastic decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it inevitably,</v>

2802
02:04:39.811 --> 02:04:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I know this is the guy you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2803
02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>He's rights for the federalist all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and he goes,</v>

2804
02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>what happens with these people as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these problems?</v>

2805
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Clearly you're not sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

2806
02:04:47.641 --> 02:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also have bipolar and</v>

2807
02:04:50.130 --> 02:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia and manic depression and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other things.</v>

2808
02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could just get rid of my cock and</v>

2809
02:04:54.121 --> 02:04:55.650
<v Speaker 1>be a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be fine.</v>

2810
02:04:55.651 --> 02:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Then they do that and for a month</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're happy and then they realize,</v>

2811
02:04:58.051 --> 02:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bipolar is still here.</v>

2812
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm still depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck have I done?</v>

2813
02:05:02.190 --> 02:05:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the cure all solution.</v>

2814
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also this,</v>

2815
02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem and that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to bring that up.</v>

2816
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Like we know when you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the average person,</v>

2817
02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>whether they're gay or straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average people,</v>

2818
02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>men and women out there in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount that are going</v>

2819
02:05:18.181 --> 02:05:19.014
<v Speaker 1>to be schizophrenia.</v>

2820
02:05:19.050 --> 02:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount that are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have all sorts of mental illnesses,</v>

2821
02:05:21.961 --> 02:05:23.190
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

2822
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start talking about transgender</v>

2823
02:05:26.641 --> 02:05:29.940
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are no longer allowed to take that</v>

2824
02:05:29.941 --> 02:05:33.960
<v Speaker 1>into consideration and you must treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>every transgender person is if there are</v>

2825
02:05:33.961 --> 02:05:38.610
<v Speaker 1>100% mentally healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insanely rare in regular</v>

2826
02:05:38.611 --> 02:05:40.920
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are not transgender,</v>

2827
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>cisgendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were,</v>

2828
02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>when you use that term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at this gender.</v>

2829
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what I sent him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that article that got me and shit.</v>

2830
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get the shit here.</v>

2831
02:05:48.061 --> 02:05:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at what's his name and</v>

2832
02:05:50.671 --> 02:05:53.970
<v Speaker 1>transparent Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever his name is,</v>

2833
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2872
02:07:18.511 --> 02:07:21.450
<v Speaker 1>manipulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can turn a man to a woman and then</v>

2873
02:07:21.451 --> 02:07:24.270
<v Speaker 1>back and forth and you really can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender fluid.</v>

2874
02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an instagram page about gender</v>

2875
02:07:27.901 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 1>fluidity and one of the things it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2876
02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2877
02:07:30.690 --> 02:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm a woman,</v>

2878
02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>but I'm always a human like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2880
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be here.</v>

2881
02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing about I'm not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobe,</v>

2882
02:07:40.601 --> 02:07:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm a homo board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who you fuck.</v>

2883
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Like when you make out in front of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

2884
02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>have a nice French session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking give a shit with Milo.</v>

2885
02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that sometimes it's black and</v>

2886
02:07:52.571 --> 02:07:54.700
<v Speaker 1>white couples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in New York there'll be walking the</v>

2887
02:07:54.701 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 1>chain holding hands and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>indignant.</v>

2888
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:57.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Got a problem with that.</v>

2890
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking someone you're attracted</v>

2891
02:08:01.541 --> 02:08:05.890
<v Speaker 1>to ooze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We to go up there and blow minds,</v>

2892
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:12.510
<v Speaker 1>you're sucking your boyfriend's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stunned and I think that's why they</v>

2893
02:08:12.641 --> 02:08:14.020
<v Speaker 1>get so mad too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I go,</v>

2894
02:08:14.021 --> 02:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you're not a snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not transgendered.</v>

2895
02:08:16.841 --> 02:08:18.880
<v Speaker 1>You're just a fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2896
02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:24.180
<v Speaker 1>when time moves on and once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really do eliminate all the things</v>

2897
02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:29.590
<v Speaker 1>that trouble us when it comes down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobia or racism,</v>

2898
02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:32.800
<v Speaker 1>all these issues that they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>still do exist.</v>

2899
02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be left with the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings themselves.</v>

2900
02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:39.520
<v Speaker 1>So when no one is transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when no one's homophobic and no one's</v>

2901
02:08:39.521 --> 02:08:42.010
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can judge you for who you are.</v>

2902
02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.100
<v Speaker 1>We're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not in a lot of ways because</v>

2903
02:08:45.101 --> 02:08:48.430
<v Speaker 1>people get free passes if they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender.</v>

2904
02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.220
<v Speaker 1>If they're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like Caitlyn Jenner saying</v>

2905
02:08:51.221 --> 02:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't support gay marriage like</v>

2906
02:08:53.290 --> 02:08:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a fucking free pass like you're</v>

2907
02:08:55.691 --> 02:08:58.600
<v Speaker 1>getting a free pass you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the best free pass.</v>

2908
02:08:58.601 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2909
02:09:00.070 --> 02:09:04.210
<v Speaker 1>she fucking killed a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She slammed her car and it's some lady</v>

2910
02:09:04.211 --> 02:09:07.750
<v Speaker 1>because she wasn't paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slammed her fucking escalate and pushed</v>

2911
02:09:07.751 --> 02:09:12.100
<v Speaker 1>her in at oncoming traffic and the lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>died and no one brings it up.</v>

2912
02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:16.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the freest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free pass of all took a life by</v>

2913
02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:21.520
<v Speaker 1>completely being negligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with this bigotry</v>

2914
02:09:21.521 --> 02:09:22.450
<v Speaker 1>of low expectations.</v>

2915
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:25.180
<v Speaker 1>You put these people on a pedestal until</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do no wrong.</v>

2916
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:27.640
<v Speaker 1>And they ended up doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that hadn't been Milo to,</v>

2917
02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:30.160
<v Speaker 1>he had to get out of jail free card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could say whatever he wants and the</v>

2918
02:09:30.161 --> 02:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes too far on the devil's advocacy</v>

2919
02:09:32.981 --> 02:09:35.140
<v Speaker 1>with the 13 year olds sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

2920
02:09:35.141 --> 02:09:36.430
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on guys,</v>

2921
02:09:36.431 --> 02:09:38.770

<v Speaker 1>We're all the same.</v>

2922
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Racism is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homophobia is over.</v>

2923
02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's not sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racism is over.</v>

2924
02:09:44.531 --> 02:09:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's plenty of racist people.</v>

2925
02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal with racism.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the same way about the giants.</v>

2949
02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2950
02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2951
02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to deny myself this</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting conversation because you're</v>

2952
02:10:46.281 --> 02:10:47.330
<v Speaker 1>a negro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>

2953
02:10:47.331 --> 02:10:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you're being rational though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're talking about rational</v>

2954
02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:56.480
<v Speaker 1>deny themselves money that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't deny things that are</v>

2955
02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:58.010
<v Speaker 1>gonna make them money and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish,</v>

2956
02:10:58.020 --> 02:10:59.240
<v Speaker 1>don't deny themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool,</v>

2957
02:10:59.241 --> 02:11:03.350
<v Speaker 1>interesting friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's plenty of people today</v>

2958
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:07.070
<v Speaker 1>amongst us that are very racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is racist?</v>

2959
02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Racist is prejudging someone based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the color of their skin or their ethnic</v>

2960
02:11:11.121 --> 02:11:13.220
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

2961
02:11:13.230 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 1>the guy likes all this stuff you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you refuse to see them as an</v>

2962
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:20.480
<v Speaker 1>exception to the ones you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're looking at him and at</v>

2963
02:11:20.481 --> 02:11:22.280
<v Speaker 1>the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's that one guy and your</v>

2964
02:11:22.281 --> 02:11:23.270
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:11:23.590 --> 02:11:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you,</v>

2966
02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 1>you're painting some very simplistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios that deal with a really</v>

2967
02:11:28.251 --> 02:11:31.610
<v Speaker 1>complex issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People prejudging people and people not</v>

2968
02:11:31.611 --> 02:11:34.870
<v Speaker 1>liking people or people identify with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that look like them.</v>

2969
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you and me being too white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2970
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.830
<v Speaker 1>The racist you're describing doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like black people.</v>

2971
02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing up a scenario where if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees a black person say there is a</v>

2972
02:11:43.871 --> 02:11:46.400
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this thin veneer,</v>

2973
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:48.740
<v Speaker 1>oily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slick in the bathtub.</v>

2974
02:11:48.741 --> 02:11:51.080
<v Speaker 1>When you have brill cream and you take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bath,</v>

2975
02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:53.780
<v Speaker 1>all you got to do to go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just go.</v>

2976
02:11:54.590 --> 02:11:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So the second that black guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the giants this year,</v>

2977
02:11:57.410 --> 02:12:00.500
<v Speaker 1>that guy's racism just goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have so much more prejudice for</v>

2978
02:12:00.501 --> 02:12:04.730
<v Speaker 1>people wear flip flops for men who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>those utility backpacks when they wear a</v>

2979
02:12:04.731 --> 02:12:05.700
<v Speaker 1>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about man,</v>

2980
02:12:05.701 --> 02:12:07.490
<v Speaker 1>stay at home dads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man buns.</v>

2981
02:12:07.491 --> 02:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could be your facility</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpacks and then wear a suit.</v>

2982
02:12:10.410 --> 02:12:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Father's suit on put their backpack is</v>
<v Speaker 1>all mountain climb marine with an</v>

2983
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:16.130
<v Speaker 1>ergonomic things and it bothers you.</v>

2984
02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:19.490
<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that bother?</v>

2985
02:12:19.491 --> 02:12:21.260
<v Speaker 1>You should have a briefcase if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a suit.</v>

2986
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:23.360
<v Speaker 1>But what do you mountain climbing and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2987
02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.790
<v Speaker 1>you're a tax audit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is that?</v>

2988
02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean they want to have their laptop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all their books and they want to</v>

2989
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:31.070
<v Speaker 1>carry it and it's easy to carry things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your bag.</v>

2990
02:12:31.071 --> 02:12:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So find a canvas backpack if you must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's the matter with Karen and I</v>

2991
02:12:36.021 --> 02:12:37.760
<v Speaker 1>don't even like when people have rolling</v>
<v Speaker 1>luggage,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we all are growing luggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't carry 20 pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You Pussy rolling luggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to roll.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>

2996
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:49.070
<v Speaker 1>is this acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This backpack?</v>

2997
02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great because you have a tee</v>

2998
02:12:50.541 --> 02:12:51.470
<v Speaker 1>shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2999
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:55.310
<v Speaker 1>so your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your backpack is actually more a fancy</v>

3000
02:12:55.311 --> 02:12:57.230
<v Speaker 1>mall than your clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

3001
02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I might not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not measuring and matching up</v>

3002
02:12:59.091 --> 02:13:00.950
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're matching up just fine.</v>

3003
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>But if a young Jamie with his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a certain type of backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

3009
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 1>My problem with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3010
02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:20.090
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have anything on your tee</v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt after 30 but that's a fighter and</v>

3011
02:13:20.091 --> 02:13:22.110
<v Speaker 1>the kid promoted my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3012
02:13:22.150 --> 02:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3013
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends,</v>

3014
02:13:24.441 --> 02:13:26.090
<v Speaker 1>this is my friend John Dudley's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3015
02:13:26.091 --> 02:13:29.900
<v Speaker 1>you're doing an ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people like loans on your shirt when</v>

3016
02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you're 40 or no one cares what bands</v>

3017
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:33.600
<v Speaker 2>you like at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3018
02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my general point is we all have our</v>

3019
02:13:35.881 --> 02:13:39.150
<v Speaker 2>little quirks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You general point is you're very</v>

3020
02:13:39.151 --> 02:13:41.670
<v Speaker 2>specific in what you allow people to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not do.</v>

3021
02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Very rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Guy,</v>

3022
02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 2>we were in Jamaica on vacation and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all you can eat thing.</v>

3023
02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had his plate and he just,</v>

3024
02:13:48.571 --> 02:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>he must've been Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He piled on three huge spoonfuls of</v>

3025
02:13:52.741 --> 02:13:55.170
<v Speaker 2>mashed potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took up most of his plate.</v>

3026
02:13:55.590 --> 02:13:57.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking at him going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in fucking Jamaica,</v>

3027
02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:00.450
<v Speaker 2>the jerk chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this fancy shit and you're using up</v>

3028
02:14:00.451 --> 02:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>your whole meal on mashed potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3029
02:14:02.101 --> 02:14:03.120
<v Speaker 2>that bothers me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mic.</v>

3030
02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And I hated him for the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

3031
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I think I needed someone to hate on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

3032
02:14:08.821 --> 02:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>So I would see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd just be like eating an ice cream</v>

3033
02:14:10.921 --> 02:14:11.850
<v Speaker 2>cone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just go,</v>

3034
02:14:11.851 --> 02:14:12.684
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

3035
02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you do you recognize that's your</v>

3036
02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:17.490
<v Speaker 2>own personal issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Scottish thing.</v>

3037
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Same as the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were at war for 800 years with the</v>

3038
02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:23.150
<v Speaker 2>English and they're constantly looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the ones who don't like confrontation</v>

3039
02:14:23.151 --> 02:14:24.690
<v Speaker 2>or extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3040
02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.730
<v Speaker 2>so Dr drew says this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3041
02:14:26.731 --> 02:14:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the reason that Scott's are drunks is</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>

3042
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:32.700
<v Speaker 2>they like conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'll put a war in their body.</v>

3043
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:35.250
<v Speaker 2>So they were going out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those walking is hard.</v>

3044
02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving myself a handicap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we liked struggle.</v>

3045
02:14:39.031 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 2>We like pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

3046
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Even in fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never totally enjoying it.</v>

3047
02:14:46.471 --> 02:14:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to last longer.</v>

3048
02:14:47.671 --> 02:14:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Think of Kevin Spacey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do the alphabet backwards.</v>

3049
02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:53.380
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you think of Kevin Space Still?</v>

3050
02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you think of kindness.</v>

3051

<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>

3052
02:14:56.401 --> 02:14:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife can't walk to that.</v>

3053
02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 2>You Imagine Kevin Spacey's head floating</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the bed.</v>

3054
02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Not like dismembered and bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like his face doing nothing.</v>

3055
02:15:07.081 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Just staring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just staring at you two and a half</v>

3056
02:15:10.201 --> 02:15:12.310
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you imagine him as Kaiser San Jose or</v>

3057
02:15:12.311 --> 02:15:14.160
<v Speaker 2>as Frank Underwood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3058
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have strong feelings about it.</v>

3059
02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:17.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that.</v>

3060
02:15:17.051 --> 02:15:19.680
<v Speaker 2>A house of lies show her cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The card show.</v>

3061
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds great.</v>

3062
02:15:20.851 --> 02:15:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I'm in a season three</v>

3063
02:15:23.701 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3064
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:26.130
<v Speaker 2>just started off like you were seeing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>

3065
02:15:26.190 --> 02:15:26.581
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3066
02:15:26.581 --> 02:15:27.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3067
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Intuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a guy who was gay and he</v>

3068
02:15:29.701 --> 02:15:30.750
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with Kevin Spacey.</v>

3069
02:15:30.751 --> 02:15:33.360
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you tell him banging them that I use</v>

3070
02:15:33.361 --> 02:15:35.460
<v Speaker 2>him and all my friends do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

3071
02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

3072
02:15:36.601 --> 02:15:39.840
<v Speaker 2>That's really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had never occurred to me that,</v>

3073
02:15:39.841 --> 02:15:41.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be known as the guy</v>

3074
02:15:41.311 --> 02:15:42.540
<v Speaker 2>who can make you not come.</v>

3075
02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants that.</v>

3076
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:45.990
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even fucking,</v>

3077
02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:48.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when trump won,</v>

3078
02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:50.340
<v Speaker 2>we had a big party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were all wearing Hawaiian shirts.</v>

3079
02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:53.490
<v Speaker 2>And when I saw Donald Trump president on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big screen in the bar,</v>

3080
02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:56.190
<v Speaker 2>everyone started cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Buddy Alan was just pouring beer on</v>

3081
02:15:56.191 --> 02:15:57.660
<v Speaker 2>his head and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3082
02:15:57.661 --> 02:15:59.160
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't want to bomb other guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

3083
02:15:59.190 --> 02:16:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but my brain hadn't processed it yet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't thoroughly enjoy it.</v>

3084
02:16:02.491 --> 02:16:05.130
<v Speaker 2>And then everyone picked me up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're carrying me around the bar.</v>

3085
02:16:05.131 --> 02:16:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any problems with him being</v>

3086
02:16:07.951 --> 02:16:09.410
<v Speaker 2>the president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3087
02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:10.191
<v Speaker 2>cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3088
02:16:10.191 --> 02:16:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you seem pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty aware and pretty rational other</v>

3089
02:16:14.011 --> 02:16:16.950
<v Speaker 2>than the way you make people dress and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear backpacks.</v>

3090
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:20.160
<v Speaker 2>But did you have any problems with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>being president?</v>

3091
02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything disturbs you about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are you totally open?</v>

3092
02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Like if he starts fucking with the First</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amendment,</v>

3093
02:16:24.900 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to drag him out of there by</v>
<v Speaker 2>his heels.</v>

3094
02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not excited about this son in law</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a job.</v>

3095
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like nepotism</v>

3096
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.120
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a coincidence.</v>

3097
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Your son in law is the most qualified</v>
<v Speaker 1>person for the job.</v>

3098
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's times when the tweets can be</v>

3099
02:16:35.981 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>petty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why we're talking about</v>

3100
02:16:37.121 --> 02:16:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger's a ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3101
02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:41.081
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3102
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not excited about the travel budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he is doing a lot of shit.</v>

3103
02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:47.160
<v Speaker 1>But as far as what we've come out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3104
02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>and the amount of fucking left wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

3105
02:16:50.850 --> 02:16:52.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back patting that we've been going</v>

3106
02:16:52.811 --> 02:16:56.140
<v Speaker 1>through for the past eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking ecstatic.</v>

3107
02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:58.060
<v Speaker 1>What's the backpacking that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>

3108
02:16:58.061 --> 02:17:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Like they were so wonderful and Obama's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so great and you know,</v>

3109
02:17:01.811 --> 02:17:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to La and you realize that</v>

3110
02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>everyone in this fucking city thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama did an awesome job.</v>

3111
02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 1>And they also think that Bill Maher is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher hitchens.</v>

3112
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Like he's an intellectual Demi God in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this town.</v>

3113
02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3114
02:17:15.551 --> 02:17:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Every time I talked to someone they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3115
02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:18.213
<v Speaker 1>you should talk to go.</v>

3116
02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see you in a room with Bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maher.</v>

3117
02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your intellectual heavyweight.</v>

3118
02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 1>That's your main guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he would probably agree with you</v>

3119
02:17:24.701 --> 02:17:27.820
<v Speaker 1>on a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really be confusing to them</v>

3120
02:17:27.821 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 1>because he agreed with Milo on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3121
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:31.420
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people are mad at him</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

3122
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that he removed Milo,</v>

3123
02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:37.480
<v Speaker 1>reminded him of a young Christopher</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitchens except you know,</v>

3124
02:17:37.481 --> 02:17:39.870
<v Speaker 1>gay and foppish and he said a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things about him.</v>

3125
02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

3126
02:17:41.081 --> 02:17:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just got abandoned some of what</v>

3127
02:17:42.941 --> 02:17:46.750
<v Speaker 1>you're doing because some of what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is fighting the good fight against</v>

3128
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:51.310
<v Speaker 1>irrational feminism that denies the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological differences between men and</v>

3129
02:17:51.311 --> 02:17:55.750
<v Speaker 1>women and lies about the gender wage gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these different things that he</v>

3130
02:17:55.751 --> 02:18:00.700
<v Speaker 1>does accurately point out which people</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all the fucking time and drives me</v>

3131
02:18:00.701 --> 02:18:01.300
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

3132
02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about a way too many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the show,</v>

3133
02:18:02.981 --> 02:18:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but that God damn gender gap was in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian yesterday.</v>

3134
02:18:06.051 --> 02:18:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when Obama said it,</v>

3135
02:18:07.481 --> 02:18:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know that you're full of shit?</v>

3136
02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

3137
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:13.630
<v Speaker 1>You know you have researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ask him or are you knowingly</v>

3138
02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.200
<v Speaker 1>repeating this myth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most people don't get votes.</v>

3139
02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smart people that I know who have</v>

3140
02:18:20.531 --> 02:18:23.710
<v Speaker 1>not looked into it or haven't had</v>
<v Speaker 1>debates about it with other people don't</v>

3141
02:18:23.711 --> 02:18:25.660
<v Speaker 1>understand what the gender pay gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>

3142
02:18:25.661 --> 02:18:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That it's simply a matter of working</v>
<v Speaker 1>less hours and choosing different jobs.</v>

3143
02:18:29.141 --> 02:18:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One man,</v>

3144
02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:34.150
<v Speaker 1>one woman working side by side doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same job with a woman makes</v>

3145
02:18:34.151 --> 02:18:36.280
<v Speaker 1>significantly less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're being led to</v>

3146
02:18:36.281 --> 02:18:39.850
<v Speaker 1>believe and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a real sticking point with</v>

3147
02:18:39.851 --> 02:18:40.330
<v Speaker 1>feminism.</v>

3148
02:18:40.330 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>They're being dishonest in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayal of the issues of the workplace</v>

3149
02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:47.320
<v Speaker 1>and you end up going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are making me think woman are</v>

3150
02:18:47.321 --> 02:18:50.530
<v Speaker 1>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't like that woman's March.</v>

3151
02:18:50.531 --> 02:18:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are,</v>

3152
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're out to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prove here that your pussy has teeth,</v>

3153
02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:55.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making women look dumb.</v>

3154
02:18:56.050 --> 02:18:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Even the abortion thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half 50% of women are pro life.</v>

3155
02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.510
<v Speaker 1>So why are you making this a gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue?</v>

3156
02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:03.430
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an ethics thing.</v>

3157
02:19:03.431 --> 02:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like a euthanasia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does nothing to do with men or</v>

3158
02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.830
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay with abortion up to a</v>

3159
02:19:08.831 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 1>certain age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3160
02:19:10.810 --> 02:19:14.620
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So week after conception when it's a</v>

3161
02:19:14.621 --> 02:19:16.540
<v Speaker 1>bundle of cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of your fingernail,</v>

3162
02:19:17.350 --> 02:19:17.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3163
02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Do not kill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3164
02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>No heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just uh,</v>

3165
02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:23.590
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of viable cluster.</v>

3166
02:19:23.591 --> 02:19:26.380
<v Speaker 1>A little gals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful little three cells sitting</v>

3167
02:19:26.381 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can suck it out with one of those</v>

3168
02:19:27.921 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 1>tiny</v>

3169
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:30.290
<v Speaker 2>cocktail straws you don't really drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of,</v>

3170
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:32.660
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stuck it out and they want you to</v>

3171
02:19:32.661 --> 02:19:35.620
<v Speaker 2>splat against the plexiglass walls</v>
<v Speaker 2>ripped down the side.</v>

3172
02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Turns out it's good for your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we can get down to the morning after</v>

3173
02:19:38.481 --> 02:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>pills and that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to debate to go there.</v>

3174
02:19:41.931 --> 02:19:44.270
<v Speaker 2>But right now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way too far down the line.</v>

3175
02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:45.710
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of Bill Maher,</v>

3176
02:19:45.711 --> 02:19:48.110
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angela Merkel doesn't have kids.</v>

3177
02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:53.440
<v Speaker 2>There's this lack of connection that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these childless people have in our media</v>

3178
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:58.820
<v Speaker 2>and in our political system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an anti kid culture going on</v>

3179
02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 2>that is f no masochism combined with</v>
<v Speaker 2>laziness.</v>

3180
02:20:01.671 --> 02:20:03.440
<v Speaker 2>And it really is our death now in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

3181
02:20:03.441 --> 02:20:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm in Williamsburg with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stupid dog that I would happily</v>

3182
02:20:07.101 --> 02:20:11.150
<v Speaker 2>kill right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and will kill your dog,</v>

3183
02:20:11.151 --> 02:20:12.350
<v Speaker 2>feel nothing for them.</v>

3184
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:15.260
<v Speaker 2>It's my daughter's dog and it's a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>Havanese puppy.</v>

3185
02:20:15.261 --> 02:20:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a poppy.</v>

3186
02:20:16.901 --> 02:20:18.230
<v Speaker 2>You would kill the puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3187
02:20:18.231 --> 02:20:19.070
<v Speaker 2>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3188
02:20:19.430 --> 02:20:21.620
<v Speaker 2>one of the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could take a meat cleaver to its head</v>

3189
02:20:21.621 --> 02:20:25.040
<v Speaker 2>and I would be on the phone as I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd be like preparing a chicken</v>

3190
02:20:25.041 --> 02:20:26.930
<v Speaker 2>for dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel no Jesus.</v>

3191
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I have that dog,</v>

3192
02:20:28.731 --> 02:20:30.080
<v Speaker 2>all these spinsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3193
02:20:30.081 --> 02:20:32.210
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it in boy and girl and my,</v>

3194
02:20:32.250 --> 02:20:33.950
<v Speaker 2>who fucking cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to wear a dress.</v>

3195
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:35.660
<v Speaker 2>But when you're with your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm with my kids,</v>

3196
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:37.220
<v Speaker 2>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my youngest,</v>

3197
02:20:37.221 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 2>my four year old is so cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a freak.</v>

3198
02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the elephant man of cuteness.</v>

3199
02:20:41.331 --> 02:20:42.860
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks away from people because they</v>

3200
02:20:42.861 --> 02:20:43.694
<v Speaker 2>freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3201
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:44.990
<v Speaker 2>he's Garish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so cute.</v>

3202
02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they see them with disdain.</v>

3203
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:50.480
<v Speaker 2>And I've noticed that not just in</v>
<v Speaker 2>hipster Williamsburg,</v>

3204
02:20:50.481 --> 02:20:52.430
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Fox News,</v>

3205
02:20:52.431 --> 02:20:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I would get that from people who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have kids.</v>

3206
02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Are you sitting at Fox News and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking around the table and you're</v>

3207
02:20:56.541 --> 02:20:58.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting here talking about family</v>

3208
02:20:58.311 --> 02:21:02.840
<v Speaker 2>values and the future of America and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only person in this entire panel</v>

3209
02:21:02.841 --> 02:21:07.841
<v Speaker 2>with kids and I can't help but think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Angela Merkel suicidal policy of</v>

3210
02:21:08.061 --> 02:21:12.920
<v Speaker 2>bringing the refugees and fuck the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>country is somehow lik linked to her.</v>

3211
02:21:12.921 --> 02:21:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Childlessness it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly linked to her desire to</v>

3212
02:21:16.881 --> 02:21:19.700
<v Speaker 2>not come off as racist or homophobic or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

3213
02:21:19.701 --> 02:21:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3214
02:21:21.501 --> 02:21:24.200
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely like their life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>parties and dinner parties.</v>

3215
02:21:24.201 --> 02:21:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't want things to be weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you have,</v>

3216
02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:28.040
<v Speaker 2>when you have skin in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

3217
02:21:28.041 --> 02:21:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking care if you hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta make sure that things are kosher</v>

3218
02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:33.440
<v Speaker 2>for the boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Dana,</v>

3219
02:21:33.470 --> 02:21:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Dana Lash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a feminist raver with big</v>

3220
02:21:36.231 --> 02:21:40.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking Ginkgo genes in college and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chain wallet.</v>

3221
02:21:40.490 --> 02:21:45.080
<v Speaker 2>And then she saw what a feminism was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing to young boys and making them</v>

3222
02:21:45.081 --> 02:21:47.330
<v Speaker 2>ashamed of being men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she had boys.</v>

3223
02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:48.111
<v Speaker 2>She went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3224
02:21:48.111 --> 02:21:50.630
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We created a monster here and pivoted</v>

3225
02:21:50.631 --> 02:21:53.870
<v Speaker 2>and became all about saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity is aok.</v>

3226
02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck these feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were wrong.</v>

3227
02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:59.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird times,</v>

3228
02:21:59.211 --> 02:22:01.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird times where people try</v>

3229
02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:04.340
<v Speaker 2>and define themselves now just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>breed.</v>

3230
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to some asshole at the bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night and he's repeating what he</v>

3231
02:22:07.941 --> 02:22:10.490
<v Speaker 2>saw and in all of her stone movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

3280
02:23:59.130 --> 02:24:01.230
<v Speaker 2>She should be nude at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you kind of want them to wear</v>

3281
02:24:01.231 --> 02:24:03.120
<v Speaker 2>clothes so you can take the clothes off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
