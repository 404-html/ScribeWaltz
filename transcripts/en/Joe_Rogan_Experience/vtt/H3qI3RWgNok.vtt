<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.103
<v Speaker 1>Kelly slater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about doing this for </v>

4
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>how long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couple of years.</v>

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>While for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being here.</v>

6
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we finally got a chance to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

7
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>What are you in California for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you broke your foot,</v>

8
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke my foot real bad.</v>

9
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might.</v>

10
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Well my girlfriend's from San Clemente </v>
<v Speaker 1>and her family lives there and uh,</v>

11
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.753
<v Speaker 1>so we kind of live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not moving around too much so I'm </v>

12
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>just going to here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not competing.</v>

13
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.993
<v Speaker 1>I broke my foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was surfing in South Africa about 15 </v>

14
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>months ago and I was just on a wave that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't consider a very big wave.</v>

15
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would really considered dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it all kind of closed out,</v>

16
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.151
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.984
<v Speaker 1>when it all breaks at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just pulled into thing because I was </v>

18
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:49.371
<v Speaker 1>going to sort of wash on the rocks right</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that was and change boards and uh,</v>

19
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I was practicing.</v>

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I had to compete and about two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>from then.</v>

21
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.983
<v Speaker 1>So I was just testing out different </v>
<v Speaker 1>boards for some reason I wasn't riding </v>

22
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was planning on writing competition so</v>

23
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.723
<v Speaker 1>I was going to come in and change and </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch to my norm board and I just </v>

24
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.394
<v Speaker 1>pulled this wave and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda hesitated like usually you </v>

25
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:06.274
<v Speaker 1>either ride those out and stay on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>board or you jump off and I was kind of </v>

26
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>between the two and I kind of lifted my </v>
<v Speaker 1>front foot off my back foot.</v>

27
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.283
<v Speaker 1>My leg was straight because I was kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to think I was going to jump off </v>

28
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>and as my foot got my leg got locked </v>
<v Speaker 1>back straight.</v>

29
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>The board flipped in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

30
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>against the toes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just broke the top of my foot and</v>

31
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like immediate.</v>

32
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Like there was my guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.603
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at a photograph of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert right now and it's like every </v>

34
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>bone it's snapped.</v>

35
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Well what you can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you know,</v>

36
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>are you aware of the Liz Frank joint </v>
<v Speaker 1>niches?</v>

37
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Like that's where the first big </v>
<v Speaker 1>metatarsal comes together.</v>

38
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>So that first big joint on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot there.</v>

39
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Why is it called a Liz frank joint list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank was a doctor,</v>

40
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I think is what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

41
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>we could look this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the person that did the</v>

42
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.304
<v Speaker 1>original surgery when you used to break </v>
<v Speaker 1>your foot in a stirrup back 100 years </v>

43
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to cut your foot off.</v>

44
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

45
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was,</v>

46
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

47
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of how this sort of joint </v>
<v Speaker 1>got famous.</v>

48
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>But normally what happens is those toes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two bones right there,</v>

49
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>the first and second metatarsal can </v>
<v Speaker 1>either spread or converge one way or the</v>

50
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.764
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually what a liz frank </v>

51
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>fracture is.</v>

52
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I had the best of the three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

53
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I had a crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just see on the right side of.</v>

54
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go down with the cursor right </v>

55
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little lower.</v>

56
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a little crack right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>right there on that corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next one broke across.</v>

58
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>You can just see right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cracked across.</v>

59
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And then so it kind of went in a line up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and across the foot.</v>

60
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And then the other two are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>

61
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>The third one displaced the fourth when </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattered into eight pieces.</v>

62
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>The doctor said he lost count putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back together and then,</v>

63
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

64
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.513
<v Speaker 1>you would know from injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with when the shatters of </v>

65
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not getting the blood flow.</v>

66
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like a four or five week </v>
<v Speaker 1>repair job.</v>

67
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.353
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like nine months before that </v>

68
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>thing was together properly.</v>

69
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.143
<v Speaker 1>So when they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they piece that shattered one </v>

70
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.833
<v Speaker 1>back together again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A delicately and they put like a mesh </v>

71
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to kind of like figure out how </v>

72
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I had,</v>

73
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I had a plate on the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank,</v>

74
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:15.964
<v Speaker 1>and then it had a plant play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a bridge across the third and </v>

75
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.254
<v Speaker 1>fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they kind of meshed it all </v>

76
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.134
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

77
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I had 16 screws combined in all </v>

78
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

79
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

80
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal.</v>

81
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>The problem with it was I did it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa where I wasn't going to get</v>

82
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.034
<v Speaker 1>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to wait for the swelling to go </v>

83
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>down for about six days before I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly.</v>

84
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.763
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they thought it was going to </v>

85
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>swell too much because it was already </v>
<v Speaker 1>swollen from the event.</v>

86
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So I shit on my foot for like five days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sat there and watched.</v>

87
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.853
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the waves were perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was sitting on the beach as </v>

88
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>watching perfect waves and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

89
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>that's like as painful as the injury to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a surfer,</v>

90
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like watching a bunch of elk walked</v>

91
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>by in front of you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

92
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.360
<v Speaker 1>not scared of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

93
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.013
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I sat there because the whole time </v>

94
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>prior to me being injured while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for like two weeks,</v>

95
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.223
<v Speaker 1>the ways weren't very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I broke my foot in the way he's got </v>

96
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:13.924
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

97
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So I had to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

98
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>that's painful for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

99
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.033
<v Speaker 1>so then I waited for the swelling to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then it's too red eyes to get </v>

100
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.184
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there no way you could get it fixed </v>

101
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>in South Africa?</v>

102
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.693
<v Speaker 1>I maybe could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I was probably looking at St </v>

103
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.173
<v Speaker 1>Africa for a month or more in and also I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know that the quality sort of </v>

104
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>level of quality of doctor I was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get there.</v>

105
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And I got a doctor I work with here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I called him straightaway.</v>

106
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.613
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

107
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>it's my fourth broken foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never broken it like this.</v>

108
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's like let it heal for four </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

109
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>And you're surfing and it's all from </v>
<v Speaker 1>surfing.</v>

110
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In offering the same way.</v>

111
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.413
<v Speaker 1>I'll really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really pretty much the board going back </v>

112
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>against the foot fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

113
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually it happens when I'm,</v>

114
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how well versed you are in </v>

115
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:58.114
<v Speaker 1>surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm tube riding and usually </v>

116
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>with my back to the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has happened two or three times.</v>

117
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lip pitches over and lands.</v>

118
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>But when that lands it sends a shock </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into the way.</v>

119
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.883
<v Speaker 1>when the lip hits flatwater that lip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the energy goes down and some </v>

121
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>disperses out and up and some comes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the tube,</v>

122
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>so if it does that and you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong spot,</v>

123
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the board will flip into your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oh wow.</v>

124
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Normally what we do is we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you rubbed backside barrel ride,</v>

125
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:27.634
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you're grabbing the rail </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you kind of have both your feet and </v>

126
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>your hand on it so you can handle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock,</v>

127
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>but if you're just going no hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>backside,</v>

128
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.853
<v Speaker 1>it's usually pretty big intense barrel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that lip has a lot of energy and </v>

129
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>it shoots a ton of force back towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

130
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it hits your board just rolling,</v>

131
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>it can flip in your foot and break it.</v>

132
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anybody else's broken their </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot like you like that?</v>

133
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Not this bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one guy on tour broke his foot.</v>

134
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Pretty bad knee requiring surgery this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

135
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>That looks horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

136
00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>How long was it before you can walk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're walking.</v>

137
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.084
<v Speaker 1>Totally normal now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long has it been since the </v>

138
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:05.291
<v Speaker 1>surgery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had surgery in July last year and then</v>

139
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>walking normal wasn't until maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>December,</v>

140
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>December I competed again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I probably shouldn't have,</v>

142
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at pipeline in Hawaii,</v>

143
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing maneuvers.</v>

144
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not a small wave kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

145
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.733
<v Speaker 1>If the waves are small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have served since it's </v>

146
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:26.954
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little easier because you take </v>

147
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>off and kind of trim a straight line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of going straight,</v>

148
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're writing the barrel,</v>

149
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of going straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are you conscious of your foot being</v>

150
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>compromised?</v>

151
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

152
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

153
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite event in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just didn't want to miss it.</v>

154
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>But fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you broke your foot again.</v>

155
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>

156
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>the bones were pretty good back together</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

157
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.274
<v Speaker 1>And I could walk somewhat without pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I put myself in a real </v>

158
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable,</v>

159
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable position on a wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of maybe jump off,</v>

160
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't really push it.</v>

161
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth winning a contest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dillon foot again,</v>

162
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:03.254
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure to be able to surf pipeline</v>
<v Speaker 1>with no one out is kind of worth the </v>

163
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you are healing,</v>

164
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>is there anything they give you that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate bone healing or is there any.</v>

165
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Supplements are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of.</v>

166
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the furthest place from your</v>

167
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:20.511
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:21.210
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

169
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>it's down at the bottom of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to kind of get that foot up.</v>

170
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.093
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times I'll sit against a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall and elevate my foot and let it </v>

171
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:28.934
<v Speaker 1>completely flush out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're a kid and you kind </v>

172
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 1>of hold your hand and somebody pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the blood out of your hand,</v>

173
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you ever do that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

174
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like this trick where somebody hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

175
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

176
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>your arteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So No blood's going in,</v>

177
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you push all the hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the blood out and then you let it go</v>

178
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a little spider web feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if somebody goes like that,</v>

179
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>it was killing a spider web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did do that when I was a kid.</v>

180
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.673
<v Speaker 1>So it was forgotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of imagined that's what I </v>

181
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>was doing with my foot up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

182
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.033
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the blood's getting out of my foot </v>

183
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:55.634
<v Speaker 1>now and I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did you like research whether </v>

184
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 1>there's something that accelerates bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>healing or you can use magnets.</v>

185
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Magnets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

186
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe magnets help </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the circulation and thus the,</v>

187
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

188
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:11.474
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotating magnet because it kind of </v>

189
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>creates a force field around your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

190
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly,</v>

191
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the magnets.</v>

192
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Is this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are these legit people are,</v>

193
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.120
<v Speaker 1>these days are like theories healer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>healer,</v>

194
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.243
<v Speaker 1>energy healer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I'm just saying what I've heard </v>

195
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I broke my foot,</v>

196
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chiropractor,</v>

197
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Guy I had gone to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

198
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>just when you go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to hurt,</v>

199
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 1>you just put her on your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was actually competing,</v>

200
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five weeks after I broke that foot.</v>

201
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.493
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if it helped or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just asleep and it was near my </v>

202
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>foot and maybe it helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes six weeks for a bone heal,</v>

203
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it?</v>

204
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.223
<v Speaker 1>When you're on to take four weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it takes two more weeks for the </v>

205
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>calcium to properly fill in.</v>

206
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.383
<v Speaker 2>So like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take an extra after four weeks </v>

207
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 2>it'll still look like there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a break there,</v>

208
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but apparently the bone has sutured </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself back.</v>

209
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 2>But if calcium has not filled in to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it totally strong.</v>

210
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.263
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was told by my doctor on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this last one because I asked every </v>

211
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:17.510
<v Speaker 2>question possible why is it still look </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken?</v>

212
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Why is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was telling me,</v>

213
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:19.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not till you get enough blood flow </v>

214
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.223
<v Speaker 2>and then it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's once there's the proper </v>

215
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 2>blood flow in the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get the calcium coming back.</v>

216
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:27.624
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing that I've heard too </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really is supposed to accelerate </v>

217
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 2>healing is a hyperbaric chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I didn't do.</v>

218
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I had one sort of at hand in Hawaii I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have gone to,</v>

219
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know I was supposed to.</v>

220
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I know that Uriah Faber use that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>after he fought Josie Aldo,</v>

221
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>although kick the shit out of his leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his leg was really badly.</v>

222
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Swollen was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Bra.</v>

223
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Did he break the bone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

224
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 2>it didn't break the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was.</v>

225
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:49.674
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like his left leg was literally </v>

226
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:54.850
<v Speaker 2>twice the size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And remember Paul,</v>

227
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the flight photo.</v>

228
00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:57.964
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking there it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a photo and in the fight you're </v>

229
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the color on his leg.</v>

230
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.650
<v Speaker 2>It was so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

231
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Although when he was in his prime and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't see those kicks,</v>

232
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't see his kicks coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>

233
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even load up it just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably right afterwards.</v>

234
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.733
<v Speaker 2>It must've felt broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels fucking horrible just to get </v>

235
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>hit once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

236
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

237
00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 2>It's so tough to just take that over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

238
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Like he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was He.</v>

239
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Can you check those and what it can you </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn it into?</v>

240
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when you get hit what </v>

241
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 2>just getting hit once by a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good,</v>

242
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:36.324
<v Speaker 2>like a peter or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or someone who's like a really good leg </v>

243
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.350
<v Speaker 2>kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hit you once and you're,</v>

244
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you're not even going to lift your leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>upright.</v>

245
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of a Charlie horse,</v>

246
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:46.340
<v Speaker 2>that guy gives you in school when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid and how bad that,</v>

247
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 2>that's probably 10 times out of 10 times</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

248
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a Nesto who's probably one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest lessons,</v>

249
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.023
<v Speaker 2>not probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely one of the greatest lake </v>

250
00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:55.814
<v Speaker 2>carriers of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a video called the perfect </v>

251
00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.154
<v Speaker 2>leg kick by Ernesto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's then it just shows you like a </v>

252
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:02.454
<v Speaker 2>compilation of him landing leg kicks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you just see like you see </v>

253
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

254
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 2>their legs buckle.</v>

255
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would walk with him.</v>

256
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 2>He would whip it down like he had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>angle.</v>

257
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:14.311
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

258
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>he's a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall guy.</v>

259
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And his technique was just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no video of him.</v>

260
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 2>He was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch his left,</v>

261
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 2>left kick or left kick and then left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hooked rather than the right leg kick.</v>

262
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.484
<v Speaker 2>The way he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're covering up top and you don't </v>

263
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:28.910
<v Speaker 2>mind maybe even see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hook.</v>

264
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Look at this though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being the,</v>

265
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whip into it.</v>

266
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 2>He was so good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

267
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>He was so fucking good and he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>always do it.</v>

268
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left hook to the body.</v>

269
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 2>And then right leg kick afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

270
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo Arona a buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Know Ricardo?</v>

271
00:11:47.051 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 2>No Ricardo pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

272
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 2>CSR for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

273
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.460
<v Speaker 2>he surfs a lot of Brazilian guys surfing</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

274
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 2>But who did he kick rampage or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lower leg?</v>

275
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I think Vendrell a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

276
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>back in the pride days and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he killed,</v>

277
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.290
<v Speaker 2>broke someone's lower leg or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

278
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 2>He was the victim of the worst slam I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in my life.</v>

279
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>

280
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I didn't grab the leg.</v>

281
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing I didn't realize because I</v>

282
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>had watched the fight before and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't pick this up.</v>

283
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't very well versed at that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in watching fights,</v>

284
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

285
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:21.641
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.474
<v Speaker 2>the thing was I put him to sleep in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight before that and I let him go and </v>

287
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 2>then told the rep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sleeping,</v>

288
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 2>he's sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

289
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.183
<v Speaker 2>and then he woke back up and the rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of you can watch it and it touched </v>

290
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.571
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did he catch them with?</v>

293
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 2>A triangle or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of trying.</v>

294
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

295
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>no it wasn't a triangle was a teen or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

296
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Might have been a good team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were on the ground.</v>

297
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like or maybe knocked him out,</v>

298

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

300
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

303
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.204

304
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I went to a.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

310
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

319
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 2>That's when it was five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 2>He was getting involved in mma and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>really didn't have any striking.</v>

321
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was out cold for a couple of minutes.</v>

322
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:31.414
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they just offer him a shit load of </v>

323
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did he decide to take?</v>

324
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

325
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

326
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I had never met earlier at that time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought.</v>

327
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.470
<v Speaker 2>He fought a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sakharova,</v>

328
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.553
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sakharova had him in a Kamora with </v>

329
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:45.064
<v Speaker 2>his arm way behind his back and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped the fight rather than let him </v>

330
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 2>get his arm broken because he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping.</v>

331
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was like,</v>

332
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really flexible.</v>

333
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I wasn't gonna tap.</v>

334
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>

335
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see some of these yogis.</v>

336
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I follow this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Yogi guy,</v>

337
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 2>and I think this guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

338
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 2>go Kula chondral or something and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

339
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.264
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts these poses up and I think if </v>

340
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:10.204
<v Speaker 2>this guy did Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way somebody could tap him </v>

341
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>out because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing,</v>

342
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:16.090
<v Speaker 2>he's the craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you put your.</v>

343
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.013
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen somebody put their body </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these contortionists positions and </v>

344
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 2>you just wonder if somebody who's a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>true contortionists if they knew Jujitsu</v>

345
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.533
<v Speaker 2>and how to escape things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they could ever really get tagged </v>

346
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.680
<v Speaker 2>with like arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure next or gay teens or whatever.</v>

347

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.064
<v Speaker 2>the first guy that sort of introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial artists to the power of yoga </v>

406
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.220

413
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.353
<v Speaker 2>breathing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a class and they'll go,</v>

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 2>used to play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

464
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.563
<v Speaker 2>he would take a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a random stick and he would hit a </v>

465
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:54.360
<v Speaker 2>ball against a corrugated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curved a wall,</v>

466
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.220
<v Speaker 2>corrugated aluminum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.620
<v Speaker 2>one of those kind of bended walls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they use for roofing and uh,</v>

468
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.690
<v Speaker 2>so the ball would just bounce off at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different angles and uh,</v>

469
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>hit his hand.</v>

470
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Eye Coordination became like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.360
<v Speaker 2>as good as you could possibly ever have </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was like his fun thing to do.</v>

472
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.413
<v Speaker 2>Check these guys out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this crazy shit and I saw you </v>

473
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>look at this and off the head and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like these perfect shots,</v>

474
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 2>but they keep firing it back at each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

475
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Look at that off the head and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

476
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:29.610
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a coconut or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

477
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like they made it at a like,</v>

478
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Speaker 2>like a rock and some fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

479
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:35.410
<v Speaker 2>how was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was that kicks?</v>

480
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 2>That was just straight up martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a push,</v>

481
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 2>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push kick,</v>

482
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>but a roundhouse kick at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a push crescent kick.</v>

483
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.960
<v Speaker 2>This guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>

484
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the block if you can get good at </v>

485
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:52.174
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is tie because those are tie </v>

486
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you could get good at that man.</v>

487
00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's certain guys that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see them in Moitai they have.</v>

488
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's Burmese.</v>

490
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

491
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Soccer and volleyball put together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:09.694
<v Speaker 2>Those guys would be awesome fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain guys that have just </v>

493
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 2>insane leg dexterity that you see in </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>

494
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:15.694
<v Speaker 2>Like do you know sunshine is ever see </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanchez Sanchez leg kicks would be </v>

495
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.313
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

496
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Well he's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

497
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.773
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a famous highlight reel of him </v>

498
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.023
<v Speaker 2>where he throws this like fake knee off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right and then jumping roundhouse </v>

499
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:32.700
<v Speaker 2>kicks this guy in the face and chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his left and it's just the,</v>

500
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.583
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability that he has to place his </v>

501
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 2>foot like anywhere he wants.</v>

502
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>His dexterity just out the world is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>

503
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Would just be other worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

504
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>

505
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tisha slept there.</v>

506
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:45.923
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

507
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely younger guy.</v>

508
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And he was essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about.</v>

509
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.900
<v Speaker 2>They're asking about connor fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conor.</v>

510
00:21:53.901 --> 00:21:55.510
<v Speaker 2>He ever see that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

511
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd kill this guy.</v>

512
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him up so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he probably let it go.</v>

513
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick me a few times on this trade.</v>

514
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.763
<v Speaker 2>Let's try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple.</v>

515
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 2>He's so hard to hit to Sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so elusive.</v>

516
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't someone like him in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a UFC fight?</v>

517
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.210
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know how to fight on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

518
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>

519
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.600
<v Speaker 2>It's just they just pin him with another</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup guy.</v>

520
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 2>If they were smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

521
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:16.834
<v Speaker 2>that would be the smart thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to put Sam punk and </v>

522
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:21.500
<v Speaker 2>gets another ground guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are Ya?</v>

523
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

524
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 2>That would be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cm punk.</v>

525
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 2>That whole thing was everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do it.</v>

526
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch cm punk.</v>

527
00:22:30.261 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

528
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I guarantee you,</v>

529
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.413
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam punks probably a lot tougher than </v>

530
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 2>the average guy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

531
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know fighting,</v>

532
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the average fighter,</v>

533
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.880
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Average fighter,</v>

534
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 2>but maybe the average guy in a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

535
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.633
<v Speaker 2>Cm punk is a real nice guy and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say anything bad about them </v>

536
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 2>because I mean the guy gave it his all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really did.</v>

537
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally dedicated.</v>

538
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't have some humble pie and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally cool about it.</v>

539
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.593
<v Speaker 2>He was in these cool about it the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and he was cool about the second </v>

540
00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a real good guy,</v>

541
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have what I would call </v>
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>

542
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.980
<v Speaker 2>The skill just moves wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't see them against.</v>

543
00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:07.814
<v Speaker 2>When Mickey Golar came in and just went </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the top and he was probably so </v>

544
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.780
<v Speaker 2>nervous to never being in that situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a real flight.</v>

545
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been in front of the crowds,</v>

546
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:19.540
<v Speaker 2>but that was a nightmare that micky gall</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was so ridiculous.</v>

547
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Micky gall is fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good.</v>

548
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:22.803
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to have a guy like cm punk that </v>

549
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:25.714
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar </v>

550
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 2>came to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a wrestler.</v>

551
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a human being,</v>

552
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.190
<v Speaker 2>just a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cm punk is a regular guy like he's not.</v>

553
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:39.064
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing freaky about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have crazy power or weird </v>

554
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see them and go,</v>

555
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:46.090
<v Speaker 2>that guy looks super scary for a guy his</v>
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>

556
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's guys that don't look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>sand.</v>

557
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Chai himself does not look like a freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaky so frequently,</v>

558
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.640
<v Speaker 2>but when you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks,</v>

559
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.350
<v Speaker 2>he looks like an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't look like you know.</v>

560
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not like Roy Jones Jr and his prime</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

561
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 2>When you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just go,</v>

562
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're this fucking guy.</v>

563
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 2>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just so good.</v>

564
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.820
<v Speaker 2>But a guy like cm punk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have a background and he tried</v>

565
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 2>martial arts when he was like 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had no background.</v>

566
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Not Real in the even wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

567
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even wrestle.</v>

568
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It was all theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling was all entertainment,</v>

569
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think though that those guys </v>

570
00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 2>would even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the theatrical reffing,</v>

571
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 2>they would go and work on the skill like</v>
<v Speaker 2>day in,</v>

572
00:24:27.621 --> 00:24:30.030
<v Speaker 2>day out mean that's all you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a wrestler.</v>

573
00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is such a difference,</v>

574
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:32.054
<v Speaker 2>but you can work on the scale day in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>day out and then work on skill and </v>

575
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 2>someone doesn't want you to do it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

576
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

577
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And then when they're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to you,</v>

578
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking you up.</v>

579
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just nothing you can do about it.</v>

580
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Like in your mouth breathing.</v>

581
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Everything's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

582
00:24:48.331 --> 00:24:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he made a ton of money and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

583
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 2>he tested himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>

584
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean give the guy credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really did test himself.</v>

585
00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a good thing for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Dan and everyone to see,</v>

586
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh okay,</v>

587
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.550
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not,</v>

588
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.233
<v Speaker 2>let's not put someone in that position </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not put ourselves in that </v>

589
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were talking about like Logan,</v>

590
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Paul Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul fighting in the UFC,</v>

591
00:25:10.921 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logan Paul and get killed.</v>

592
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul is fucking way better,</v>

593
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.203
<v Speaker 2>way better than cm punk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logan Paul like actually knows how to </v>

594
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:21.284
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a boxing match with another </v>

595
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.563
<v Speaker 2>youtube guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was watching him throw punches in </v>

596
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

597
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.540
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy who actually knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>punch like kids punches looked good.</v>

598
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.393
<v Speaker 2>He gassed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a little tired first real fight </v>

599
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:34.100
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

600
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.310
<v Speaker 2>But he has a background in wrestling and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

601
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.470
<v Speaker 2>he actually can punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was watching him punch this guy.</v>

602
00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:40.304
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a guy who actually knows how to </v>

603
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 2>throw punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He now he knows how to,</v>

604
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.593
<v Speaker 2>he knows distance and timing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to connect and he doesn't </v>

605
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>look like Canelo Alvarez or anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

606
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but he looks like a guy who can actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch more.</v>

607
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 2>You can give him a break on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Dana is like,</v>

608
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have him fight in the UFC would be,</v>

609
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 2>he would get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd fucking cm punk fight.</v>

610
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 2>This guy is way better than him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really has a background in fighting.</v>

611
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.593
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that dynamic work for you and </v>

612
00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Dana were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 2>with something like that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be seen if somebody is a little</v>

614
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>triggered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a little sensitive,</v>

615
00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 2>they might get a little bit like angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>at you saying something like that.</v>

616
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Dana is the easiest going guy ever with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of shit.</v>

617
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked.</v>

618
00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:26.291
<v Speaker 2>Me and him have been friends for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 20 years.</v>

619
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 2>We've been friends for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been working for the UFC.</v>

620
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean I started working for the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>company in [inaudible] 97.</v>

621
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I started working for that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.150
<v Speaker 2>And then the new company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started working for them in 2002 and I</v>

623
00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 2>was friends with Dana before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just he,</v>

624
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.323
<v Speaker 2>he knows my heart's in the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also knows that if I wasn't </v>

625
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 2>honest nobody would listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

626
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:51.624
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy watching the fights and </v>

627
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 2>listening to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your critical in a fairway with people I</v>

628
00:26:58.321 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

629
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

630
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 2>when you critique what somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

631
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like if they listened the right way</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to help them.</v>

632
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.833
<v Speaker 2>Well I definitely don't say things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't know what I'm talking about </v>

633
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 2>and I don't say things that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

634
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I see something and I've watched,</v>

635
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've called at least a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

636
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many times or probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

637
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen some of the greatest </v>

638
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:26.470
<v Speaker 2>fights of all time up live in close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

639
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Right next to the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

640
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I seen a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm saying something it's probably</v>

641
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 2>because it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>

642
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.550
<v Speaker 2>But if I don't know what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

643
00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:37.384
<v Speaker 2>like it's one of the good things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having Daniel cormier there or dominick </v>

644
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.533
<v Speaker 2>Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's some aspect of fighting that </v>

645
00:27:42.571 --> 00:27:43.404
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not exactly sure about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can defer to them and I could say </v>

646
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:47.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

647
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.410
<v Speaker 2>what's so important about getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>under hook here?</v>

648
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.483
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then cormier could go off about </v>

649
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why this?</v>

650
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 2>And then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

651
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:55.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

652
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:55.761
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

653
00:27:55.761 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I like that was a big thing in the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Steve and Daniel Cormier.</v>

654
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:00.743
<v Speaker 2>Dominick Cruz was explaining how </v>
<v Speaker 2>important it was that caught me a kept </v>

655
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 2>pummeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept shifting positions and pummeling</v>

656
00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:07.764
<v Speaker 2>for under hooks and that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why I was able to land that big </v>

657
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:10.914
<v Speaker 2>right hand because he was never static.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also had to wear something to get in </v>

658
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:14.790
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah.</v>

659
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was writing Steve based face </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she pays like,</v>

660
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:18.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was such a great match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though obviously it didn't last </v>

661
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 2>very long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he,</v>

662
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 2>he took a few on the chin real hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in there.</v>

663
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.253
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Steve Bay has got to drive him </v>

664
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:29.490
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>

665
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.323
<v Speaker 2>Like she's been tweeting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't he get a straight rematch </v>

666
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.993
<v Speaker 2>straight away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's even supposedly talk at </v>

667
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor getting rematch when he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much handled everywhere.</v>

668
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's real talk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor getting a rematch.</v>

669
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:42.654
<v Speaker 2>I think the real smart money is on Tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson fighting Khabib next that Dane </v>

670
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.623
<v Speaker 2>has been saying that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I 100 percent believe that Tony </v>

671
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.673
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Tony Ferguson should have </v>

672
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:54.744
<v Speaker 2>ever been stripped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he should still be the interim </v>

673
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:56.971
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

674
00:28:56.971 --> 00:29:00.330
<v Speaker 2>the guy fell while he was doing press </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tore his knee apart.</v>

675
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.493
<v Speaker 2>Six months later it comes back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroys Anthony Pettis and spectacular </v>

676
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:06.030
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fight.</v>

677
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Pettis was great too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

678
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.700
<v Speaker 2>It was Tony's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony's just a warrior.</v>

679
00:29:11.701 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's cardio,</v>

680
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:13.884
<v Speaker 2>never runs out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throws weird stuff with everything </v>

681
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you can throw currently got upset that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we call them a Weirdo.</v>

682
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's sensitive.</v>

683
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.263
<v Speaker 2>He apparently got upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it was a brilliant Weirdo like </v>

684
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.353
<v Speaker 2>when he was on his way to the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I meant that 100 percent </v>

685
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 2>complimentary ankle weights at the weigh</v>
<v Speaker 2>ins,</v>

686
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 2>like I don't even know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He uses a wing Chung dummy.</v>

687
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 2>He sets up his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of his camp,</v>

688
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 2>his training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he sets it up himself.</v>

689
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.823
<v Speaker 2>He puts the mats down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He builds his own like heavy bag </v>

690
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 2>hangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He puts,</v>

691
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 2>he puts up Chin up bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit does it himself.</v>

692
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.993
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does construction like it's </v>

693
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 2>unfamiliar to the average training </v>
<v Speaker 2>regimen.</v>

694
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm.</v>

695
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a complimentary way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of that guy.</v>

696
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.751
<v Speaker 2>I am too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>

697
00:29:56.751 --> 00:29:57.584
<v Speaker 2>I think he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that he is the toughest </v>

698
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 2>test for Khabib because of his cardio </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of its versatility,</v>

699
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:06.680
<v Speaker 2>because he could fight really well off </v>
<v Speaker 2>his back when he submitted Kevin Lee off</v>

700
00:30:06.681 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 2>his back to win the title.</v>

701
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.243
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fantastic darce choke and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to hold guys in his guard and </v>

702
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 2>recover if he gets clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's.</v>

703
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 2>He's the most dangerous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lightweight.</v>

704
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 2>For Khabib.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

705
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:22.100
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

706
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 2>he just never gets fucking tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

707
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>And Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie trains them.</v>

708
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.720
<v Speaker 2>He's one of Eddie's students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie says he's never seen anything like</v>

709
00:30:30.721 --> 00:30:30.971
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

710
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 2>this guy work out six hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full clip,</v>

711
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.653
<v Speaker 2>everybody else's exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He keeps going there doing sprints up </v>

712
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 2>the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 laps.</v>

713
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Everybody keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just.</v>

714
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Cardio is off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's a Mexican thing too.</v>

715
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of Mexicans that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have amazing cardio,</v>

716
00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

717
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it's a running thing for sure,</v>

718
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.140
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if you go back to Julio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cesar Chavez,</v>

719
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Aka baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

720
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean Gilbert Belinda said that wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

721
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.803
<v Speaker 2>It's a Mexican thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cardio because Gilbert's always </v>

722
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:04.174
<v Speaker 2>been known for his crazy cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wonder if there's like certain </v>

723
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:07.414
<v Speaker 2>ethnicities that have an advantage or at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least a better starting point and then </v>

724
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:13.890
<v Speaker 2>it's all hard work from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

725
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 2>That must.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some genetic thing you can</v>

726
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 2>prove and the way that blood holds on to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diego Sanchez.</v>

727
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 2>He's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go insane cardio.</v>

728
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

729
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

730
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fun thing to think about.</v>

731
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

732
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

733
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 2>you go to back to boxing in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

734
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 2>how many great boxers had fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio from Mexico,</v>

735
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chavez in particular,</v>

736
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Julio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cesar Chavez,</v>

737
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:41.940
<v Speaker 2>which is where guys down the volume of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his punching.</v>

738
00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It was just never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just constantly on.</v>

739
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 2>You constantly moving forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bobbing and weaving and throwing shots.</v>

740
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes as an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a boxer,</v>

741
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to,</v>

742
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.593
<v Speaker 1>even if you didn't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to dig deep and pretend you </v>

743
00:31:54.451 --> 00:31:55.410
<v Speaker 1>had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

744
00:31:55.411 --> 00:31:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Because then it starts wearing another </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

745
00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's never stop.</v>

746
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had a,</v>

747
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:01.044
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a situation once I was super </v>

748
00:32:02.851 --> 00:32:04.320
<v Speaker 1>winded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really tired in a,</v>

749
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.480
<v Speaker 1>in a heat surfing in Tahiti and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

750
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.090
<v Speaker 1>this heat ended up sort of being like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world title heat for me.</v>

751
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.103
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was losing with like two minutes ago </v>

752
00:32:15.961 --> 00:32:16.794
<v Speaker 1>and I ended up in this paddle battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>against a guy and he's a good paddler </v>

753
00:32:19.621 --> 00:32:23.100
<v Speaker 1>and pretty fit guy and we're like head </v>
<v Speaker 1>to head.</v>

754
00:32:23.101 --> 00:32:23.934
<v Speaker 1>And what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

755
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.833
<v Speaker 1>whoever gets back out first deemed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the judges gets priority over the next </v>

756
00:32:28.021 --> 00:32:28.854
<v Speaker 1>wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can have whatever the way they </v>

757
00:32:29.251 --> 00:32:30.180
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with two minutes,</v>

758
00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.220
<v Speaker 1>three minutes left and a heat surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

759
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.530
<v Speaker 1>that's not a lot of time to get a wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>if uh,</v>

760
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:35.603
<v Speaker 1>if the wave comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be the guy that has priority </v>

761
00:32:37.471 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>for it and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

762
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 2>I could feel him just for half a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of lit up when his paddle like,</v>

763
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ahead on this guy.</v>

764
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as he did I paddle harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

765
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:47.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

766
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 2>to show him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got more and he gave up and I got</v>

767
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got,</v>

768
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 2>then I needed like a score out of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>points and I needed like a nine.</v>

769
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I got like a nine point four with 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds ago or something.</v>

770
00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

771
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like physically I was like,</v>

772
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to quit too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a poker face,</v>

774
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got more,</v>

775
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

776
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just that choice.</v>

777
00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:10.724
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get out there with the </v>

778
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 2>lungs burning and I'll feel bad for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

779
00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.450
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

780
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:20.020
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes I would imagine boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro tribe or may guys for sure.</v>

781
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you can't bluff that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you can't bluff it.</v>

782
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.883
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure it does come up where there's </v>

783
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 2>an edge one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing with Ferguson,</v>

784
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:31.860
<v Speaker 2>that pressure that he puts on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:33:31.861 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 2>He just never gets slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

786
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.080
<v Speaker 2>if you watched the Gustafson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Jon Jones fight to John late,</v>

787
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:40.610
<v Speaker 2>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know?</v>

788
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:41.444
<v Speaker 2>There could've been some doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people who winning that fight or </v>

789
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.483
<v Speaker 2>it close fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look like John just started pouring </v>

790
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:47.140
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was three.</v>

791
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strikes in the last couple rounds.</v>

792
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last rounds one him that fight.</v>

793
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 2>And by all accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Wasn't in shape by all accounts.</v>

794
00:33:56.841 --> 00:33:57.674
<v Speaker 2>John Really didn't train for that fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and didn't take Gustafson seriously and </v>

795
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.004
<v Speaker 2>kind of half assed his training camp and</v>
<v Speaker 2>still pulled it off in the championship </v>

796
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:04.760
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>

797
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.370
<v Speaker 2>That guy's livable and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>

798
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.560
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

799
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.730
<v Speaker 2>That's anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

800
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.650
<v Speaker 2>The December card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's January,</v>

801
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:13.800
<v Speaker 2>New Year's Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:15.910
<v Speaker 2>basically I think it's the December 29,</v>
<v Speaker 2>29 things.</v>

803
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.983
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because I think Gustafson's way </v>

804
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:20.564
<v Speaker 2>better now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see when Gustafson knocked out </v>

805
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:22.874
<v Speaker 2>globally to share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just looked like there was </v>

806
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 2>like a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Combinational.</v>

807
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that fight is a,</v>

808
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be one for the ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for John,</v>

809
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 2>his comeback fight for Gustafson to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rematch he's asking for forever.</v>

810
00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 2>And it will be for the light heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>

811
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.260
<v Speaker 2>They're going to strip cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to fight heavyweight in?</v>

812
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's gonna.</v>

813
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.450
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting Derrick Lewis in December </v>
<v Speaker 2>and weird flight.</v>

814
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Well he's number two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at the rankings,</v>

815
00:34:50.601 --> 00:34:51.434
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at Derrick Lewis is </v>

816
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Speaker 2>obviously unorthodox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>

817
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 2>he was just getting mauled in that last </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight.</v>

818
00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't matter when you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess in Madden when you get that last</v>

819
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:05.441
<v Speaker 2>punch and the power that he has with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>finger,</v>

820
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I,</v>

821
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.820
<v Speaker 2>why am I even talking about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just a fan.</v>

822
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.930
<v Speaker 2>He really was the number two contender </v>
<v Speaker 2>headed into that fight and then wins.</v>

823
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy was the dark horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that division.</v>

824
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 2>So for him to knock off Alexander like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

825
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a jet was a giant knockout and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get his ass kicked for three rounds.</v>

826
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Respect to to Alexander though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

827
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for staying in the pocket.</v>

828
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Fighting out with 30 seconds to go when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he clearly winning Netflix.</v>

829
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got hurt.</v>

830
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt a couple of times in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

831
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.411
<v Speaker 2>Did he just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

832
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:37.244
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one time where he lost his </v>

833
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 2>mouth piece and he tried to give it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Derek.</v>

834
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

835
00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 2>I think he was on Queer Street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

836
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he knew what the fuck was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on because Derek hits so hard.</v>

837
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't get knocked out,</v>

838
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:48.990
<v Speaker 2>you're probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

839
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 2>even a glancing blow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

840
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.061
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably like,</v>

841
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:51.894
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck me thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way he knocked out Travis Brown when he </v>

842
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.063
<v Speaker 2>knocked out Gonzaga and Derek would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>even better if he didn't have a bad </v>

843
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Derek's got a fucked up back.</v>

844
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 2>So why does he want it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's three fights in six months.</v>

845
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Or what was the last flight within </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ghana?</v>

846
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he fought in Ghana and that was the</v>

847
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 2>fight where it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

848
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:13.104
<v Speaker 2>That was barely a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like five punches thrown the </v>

849
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:19.840
<v Speaker 2>entire as a fan watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like c one against in Ghana.</v>

850
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

851
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as a fan,</v>

852
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.043
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like that was more on in </v>

853
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Ghana than it was on Derek?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

854
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt that way.</v>

855
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ghana who didn't do anything and </v>

856
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Derek one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

857
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.583
<v Speaker 2>he didn't win by much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he was basically waiting for </v>

858
00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 2>in Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be careful with in Ghana </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in Ghana punches so fucking hard</v>

860
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 2>but steep a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dude's head up.</v>

861
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 2>He really did steep ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucked his head up.</v>

862
00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.123
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

863
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:48.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was even talking about in Ghana </v>

864
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird in Ghana.</v>

865
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Before the steep a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

866
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 2>this is the second common cited for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

867
00:36:55.981 --> 00:36:56.814
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he knocked Alistair overeem into </v>

868
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 2>another dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was like,</v>

869
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

870
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.350
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>

871
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 2>that looked like a career ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punch.</v>

872
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Her Dad was like a break your neck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

873
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile overeem ready to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he fight again after that?</v>

874
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Against Curtis Blades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you did.</v>

875
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.213
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he fought curtis please </v>
<v Speaker 2>after that and lost and got stopped in </v>

876
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.140
<v Speaker 2>that fight too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

877
00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look in Ghana hits Falk in hard,</v>

878
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 2>harder than anybody has ever fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

879
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:26.484
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he's mouth breathing in the fifth </v>

880
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:28.464
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't matter because he gassed </v>

881
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>himself out in the first and he really </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't prepared for a full game.</v>

882
00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>You really didn't think was going gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the ground.</v>

883
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 2>From what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

884
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'd catch this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>

885
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.030
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought he hit so hard that steep.</v>

886
00:37:41.031 --> 00:37:41.864
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to hit Steve Bay's going to </v>

887
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:44.780
<v Speaker 2>be the heavyweight champ I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask you.</v>

888
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have your absolute dream job?</v>

889
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.000
<v Speaker 2>But I mean you do a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you,</v>

890
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 2>you get to talk UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a black belt under Eddie,</v>

891
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.613
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.483
<v Speaker 2>And so like you've kind of found the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect job for yourself because you </v>

893
00:38:00.251 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 2>just can't tell when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

894
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>You just love it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I love surfing.</v>

895
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live,</v>

896
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:05.874
<v Speaker 2>eat and breathe surf everyday I wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the first thing I do is look at </v>

897
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.930
<v Speaker 2>where's the waves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when you retire,</v>

898
00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you'll do commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

899
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

900
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't want to,</v>

901
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want a job whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

902
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

903
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.343
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on a pro tour pretty much </v>

904
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 2>since I was 19 and 46.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took about three years off,</v>

905
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:26.850
<v Speaker 2>but I would still compete a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>those years.</v>

906
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.441
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

907
00:38:27.441 --> 00:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>It's the high end of the age limit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like where does that can really</v>

908
00:38:31.471 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 2>compete?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>

909
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 2>no one's ever been my age on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

910
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the</v>

911
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 1>next oldest grand towards 38 and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>retiring this year.</v>

912
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I've gone on tour,</v>

913
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the oldest guy was 28 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

914
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.660
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

915
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 1>that I would say in the eighties there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like,</v>

916
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 1>it didn't look like you could make some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and if you were a top five guy but</v>

917
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 1>it didn't look like you could have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this crazy career.</v>

918
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:56.104
<v Speaker 1>So guys weren't thinking longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like let's go have a freaking </v>

919
00:38:57.671 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travel around the world and get paid for</v>

920
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:00.904
<v Speaker 1>it for a few years and then we'll figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a job after or maybe we'll have </v>

921
00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 1>enough money to kind of live real </v>
<v Speaker 1>humbly.</v>

922
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare and other guys?</v>

923
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that your diet strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning?</v>

924
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:11.884
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't overexert myself very much so </v>

925
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.094
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my training aside from surfing isn't a </v>

926
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.004
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

927
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.423
<v Speaker 1>I retain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I retain enough strength to </v>

928
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:24.850
<v Speaker 1>be good at what I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to find.</v>

929
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Burn yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't burn myself out,</v>

930
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause like the oldest people in the </v>

931
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 1>world weren't athletes and they're kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people who didn't burn themselves out</v>

932
00:39:33.641 --> 00:39:34.474
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

933
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.200
<v Speaker 1>my theory on longevity is like don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>overdo it.</v>

934
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to necessarily be </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtrained for what I do.</v>

935
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.660
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the,</v>

936
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the winning that I do competitively is </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a skill.</v>

937
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much from being super strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>having crazy cardio.</v>

938
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.353
<v Speaker 1>It's making a choice about which wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I'm gonna approach and ride that </v>

939
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:55.954
<v Speaker 1>wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have to get two scores every 30 </v>

940
00:39:57.041 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>minutes when they compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I got this 30 minute window</v>

941
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I need to be ready for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to be like in crazy,</v>

942
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 1>crazy shape [inaudible].</v>

943
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that held other guys back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past?</v>

944
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.413
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a number of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to naturally be really </v>

945
00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in your,</v>

946
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 1>when you were born in your home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow you had to,</v>

947
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe you needed something to prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

948
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was Kinda like,</v>

949
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up I started of back at it and </v>

950
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:23.554
<v Speaker 1>kind of laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I maybe I couldn't get the girl I </v>

951
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 1>liked because she liked an older guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

952
00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:28.204
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really have any money in my </v>

953
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:30.424
<v Speaker 1>family so I wanted to make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an older brother who kind of </v>

954
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.573
<v Speaker 1>picked on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hung out with him and played </v>

955
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:36.910
<v Speaker 1>football with his friends that were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>three years older than me.</v>

956
00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So I had to be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

957
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I had to be tough and fast.</v>

958
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I had to be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the case with a lot of guys,</v>

959
00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:43.160
<v Speaker 1>older brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.103
<v Speaker 1>brothers that they couldn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with them like this </v>

961
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:46.474
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so every night we would just eat </v>

962
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 1>away at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

963
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it did and there was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

964
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:52.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother and I have,</v>

965
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.823
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship now and I don't think he </v>

966
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:56.644
<v Speaker 1>would disagree with me that we kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get along for 20 years or more </v>

967
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.880
<v Speaker 1>resort hate each other a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

968
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 1>from the time we were teenagers we kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of grew apart,</v>

969
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

970
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I sorta started doing real well </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing on the world stage and he sort</v>

971
00:41:12.811 --> 00:41:15.520
<v Speaker 1>of stagnated and we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

972
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.520
<v Speaker 1>people and families have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamics,</v>

973
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each child has a different dynamic,</v>

974
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 1>whether the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of three,</v>

975
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.670
<v Speaker 1>all boys are younger.</v>

976
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Brother was three or six years younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>

977
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:28.510
<v Speaker 1>so he was kind of out of the loop when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were teenagers.</v>

978
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 1>He still a little kid so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really competing with him.</v>

979
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 1>But he saw us competing against each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

980
00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.733
<v Speaker 1>And maybe a few ways and it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned him off to surfing so he didn't </v>

981
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:43.790
<v Speaker 1>start surfing until he was a teenager </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he did he wrote long boards and</v>

982
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:46.180
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're both short boarders like you know,</v>

983
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:51.430
<v Speaker 1>more competition kind of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He loved kind of the old throwback,</v>

984
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the sixties and seventies surfers on </v>
<v Speaker 1>long boards or on single fins,</v>

985
00:41:55.281 --> 00:41:56.114
<v Speaker 1>which is not a modern board at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why would someone choose one or the </v>

986
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:02.300
<v Speaker 1>other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Longboards are short word.</v>

987
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:03.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

988
00:42:03.131 --> 00:42:03.964
<v Speaker 1>it's a real different skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Longboards are kind of easier to just </v>

989
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 1>get up and ride a wave.</v>

990
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.180
<v Speaker 1>But the skill you have on a long board </v>
<v Speaker 1>is more.</v>

991
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It's more ballet than it is a gym or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

992
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like big maneuvers.</v>

993
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 1>It's more like gliding on the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking like you're not trying hard.</v>

994
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more of a,</v>

995
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 1>a dance if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it is like a,</v>

996
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 1>some kind of an athletic skill and short</v>
<v Speaker 1>boarding is just,</v>

997
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:30.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going for aerials and lots of </v>

998
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:32.984
<v Speaker 1>different sort of fast maneuvers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really riding in the pocket of the wave </v>

999
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.973
<v Speaker 1>as long boarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for a different kind of </v>

1000
00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.003
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You write a different kind of way of </v>

1001
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really don't.</v>

1002
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.463
<v Speaker 1>Most of the waves we ride for modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortboarding and competition aren't </v>

1003
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:46.724
<v Speaker 1>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would ride along board because </v>

1004
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:48.224
<v Speaker 1>they're too hollowed there too quick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and you can't fit a board in the </v>

1005
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:52.154
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your brother just kinda took it up </v>

1006
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.760
<v Speaker 1>more for the fun of it and the aesthetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1007
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.893
<v Speaker 1>He literally was at the beach one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his story and he was about 14 or 15 and </v>

1008
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.350
<v Speaker 1>we always try to get them to surf and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was about eight or 10,</v>

1009
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:04.184
<v Speaker 1>I took him surfing one day at our local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a break at Sebastian in Florida and I </v>

1010
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Speaker 1>pushed him on this wave and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ate.</v>

1011
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>It was underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long time.</v>

1012
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:13.230
<v Speaker 1>It kind of freaked them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a long time,</v>

1013
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 1>a long time for an eight year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 10 seconds or eight seconds.</v>

1014
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:17.174
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're out of breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little freaky like you don't know </v>

1015
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:20.204
<v Speaker 1>which way's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he kind of quit surfing and then </v>

1016
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:24.530
<v Speaker 1>when he was like 14 or 15 years at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach and this guy,</v>

1017
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:25.364
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really respected this kind of older </v>

1018
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:28.071
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1019
00:43:28.071 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run somewhere.</v>

1020
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 1>We watched my board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a longboard and he said,</v>

1021
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:33.240
<v Speaker 1>we watched my board.</v>

1022
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And Steven said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1023
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:36.020
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>

1024
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:36.854
<v Speaker 1>or you can go use it if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you paddle out and caught a few </v>

1025
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 1>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just sort of fell in love with at</v>

1026
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:40.634
<v Speaker 1>minute with surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was something unique for him </v>

1027
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.490
<v Speaker 1>because we didn't long board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

1028
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.170
<v Speaker 1>it was that beach life and thing we </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

1029
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 1>but it was different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1030
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got his own thing.</v>

1031
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 1>And then me and my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1033
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got more and more into competition and</v>

1034
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 1>getting sponsored and stuff and he sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1035
00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.873
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just kinda started fading out of </v>

1036
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:03.760
<v Speaker 1>doing competition fulltime and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1037
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.753
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1038
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when I was a teenager,</v>

1039
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.120
<v Speaker 1>when I was in of a freshman in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

1040
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.163
<v Speaker 1>this guy moved into town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid named drew and he had sort of got </v>

1041
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:16.694
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of a couple of schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere and I got himself into some </v>

1042
00:44:19.911 --> 00:44:22.310
<v Speaker 1>trouble and when he came he came over to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beach.</v>

1043
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.143
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of in these inland schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was good at football and go to </v>

1044
00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 1>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of a really good athlete.</v>

1045
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.063
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became the quarterback on a football </v>

1046
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a baseball player,</v>

1047
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:34.860
<v Speaker 1>all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>

1048
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.720
<v Speaker 1>he was a total jock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a surfer at all.</v>

1049
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.340
<v Speaker 1>And somehow he and I became best buddies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1050
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked all the sports.</v>

1051
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I grew up playing football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

1052
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit tennis.</v>

1053
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1054
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.843
<v Speaker 1>and he and I ultimately where we got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>is he sort of became my big brother </v>

1055
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:52.463
<v Speaker 1>competitively and we used to battle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter whose feelings got </v>

1056

<v Speaker 1>game we could possibly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never paid no.</v>

1071

<v Speaker 1>he ended up owing me about 160 bucks.</v>

1082
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.490
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking tell my wife I owe you,</v>

1083
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.713

<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't pay you that.</v>

1085
00:46:04.391 --> 00:46:05.224
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll pay you like 20 bucks here and </v>

1086
00:46:06.151 --> 00:46:08.380
<v Speaker 1>there as we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But drew used to,</v>

1087
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.170
<v Speaker 1>he beat me at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was better than me.</v>

1088
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically everything.</v>

1089
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:12.503
<v Speaker 1>And so it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pingpong too on my 18th birthday that </v>

1090
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.113
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it the night upsets </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was a night that Mike Tyson </v>

1091
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 1>last the buster douglas and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1092
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the night of February 10th.</v>

1093
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 1>My birthday's in the limit on the 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were in Tokyo.</v>

1094
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:29.724
<v Speaker 1>So they were on the 11th fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson last drew shows up in my house </v>

1095
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 1>with the ping pong table and he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was like my birthday gifts.</v>

1096
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 1>All my friends want me to ping pong </v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

1097
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:39.323
<v Speaker 1>My mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my three buddies and drew beat me 17 </v>

1098
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 1>straight games in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started crying.</v>

1099
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:49.583
<v Speaker 1>I think he ended up letting me finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the last game so we could go to bed </v>

1100
00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 1>at two in the morning and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been.</v>

1101
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.843
<v Speaker 1>I've really honestly never been so </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated and just outright beaten by </v>

1102
00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:00.414
<v Speaker 1>somebody at anything and he just owned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew he owned me and he would </v>

1103
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:05.070
<v Speaker 1>just tell me where he's going to hit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball on the table and beat me.</v>

1104
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Ping Pong is a serious skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good at it.</v>

1105
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.373
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

1106
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.040
<v Speaker 1>You should go on Pol affinity on </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram and watch these things.</v>

1107
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>These guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out of hand.</v>

1108
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Ping Pong is one of those games where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1110
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.690
<v Speaker 1>if I ever got into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would eat your life.</v>

1111
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we used to stay up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and you know,</v>

1112
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 1>we sucked and we thought we were pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1113
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd,</v>

1114
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.083
<v Speaker 1>we'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1115
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>use soap and</v>

1116
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.110
<v Speaker 2>water to make our or paddles a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>stickier.</v>

1117
00:47:33.111 --> 00:47:33.944
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought we had all this pain and </v>

1118
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.490
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys are playing three way.</v>

1119
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:38.383
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's another kind of way you </v>

1120
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:45.361
<v Speaker 2>like it's a street and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>smashing the ball and it,</v>

1121
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:53.790
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy and low behind the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is there money in Ping Pong?</v>

1122
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1123
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1124
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 2>in China or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1125
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in the states there really</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1126
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 2>but that's the same thing with pool now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

1127
00:48:03.341 --> 00:48:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't see some white guy going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>China and beaten all those guys.</v>

1128
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>You see these guys are masters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't move,</v>

1129
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1130
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 2>they're the risk moves it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no dancing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:48:12.311 --> 00:48:14.710

<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

1133
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:16.143

<v Speaker 2>like everyone can kind of join in.</v>

1138

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.970
<v Speaker 2>for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to know how to fight to be</v>

1150
00:48:57.971 --> 00:48:59.400
<v Speaker 2>able to talk about fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1151
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 2>they take it real serious about that.</v>

1152
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you hear that about journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like look at this fucking guy.</v>

1153
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Probably never trained in Dana's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1154
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:06.543
<v Speaker 2>they look at a guy and he's fat or tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever and they just don't want to </v>

1155
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 2>listen to anything that they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile they could be an expert.</v>

1156
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fight Roy Nelson.</v>

1157
00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:15.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1158
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.653
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fun.</v>

1159
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Have Fun with that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a,</v>

1160
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:20.243
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid I trained with Don the </v>

1161
00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Dragon Wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1162
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 2>did you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did for about a year.</v>

1163
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I got a chance to spar him once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you.</v>

1164
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1165
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.050
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me it was like,</v>

1166
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a fan of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was totally ambidextrous Whitney.</v>

1167
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could fight any style and he,</v>

1168
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean he also had that weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sideways stance where,</v>

1169
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had like kickboxing skills,</v>

1170
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 2>boxing skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more skills,</v>

1171
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.810
<v Speaker 2>but he also had like a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>karate and Kung Fu background.</v>

1172
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.530
<v Speaker 2>So we'd stand sideways on you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what was coming at you then,</v>

1173
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.023
<v Speaker 2>Now he was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember when he fought Dennis </v>

1175
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Alexio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis,</v>

1176
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Alexia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moved to the west side of Oahu and </v>

1177
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 2>that was like all the news back and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1178
00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.573
<v Speaker 2>and he fucked Alexio up with leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like one of the first guys that </v>

1179
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:03.723
<v Speaker 2>punished Alexia with leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a thing on youtube about defense </v>

1180
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.560
<v Speaker 2>defense for self defense for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were saying like,</v>

1181
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.710
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was part of this group.</v>

1182
00:50:11.711 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked about like,</v>

1183
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna,</v>

1184
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:14.860
<v Speaker 2>teach a woman something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick,</v>

1185
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 2>kick the leg because that's the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>

1186
00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad advice before Jujitsu.</v>

1187
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.760
<v Speaker 2>People kick the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your legs carry you around.</v>

1188
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about a woman.</v>

1189
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>If a woman weighs 135 pounds,</v>

1190
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 1>she's walking around with 135 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying it.</v>

1191
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1192
00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long could you walk on your hands?</v>

1193
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I heard that brock lesnar could </v>

1194
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:38.070
<v Speaker 1>walk into his hands like a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of crazy.</v>

1195
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1196
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a legitimate free.</v>

1197
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 1>He walks in his hands all around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym.</v>

1198
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do a video,</v>

1199
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 1>like walking up the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy,</v>

1200
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 1>a surf buddy from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Santa Cruz.</v>

1201
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:51.884
<v Speaker 1>He unfortunately passed away gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and Barney a good friend of all of </v>

1202
00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:55.604
<v Speaker 1>ours and he used to do these surf video </v>
<v Speaker 1>clips and he would walk downstairs and </v>

1203
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:00.404
<v Speaker 1>then walk upstairs and he did all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could literally just walk anywhere </v>

1204
00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so cool to see.</v>

1205
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1206
00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess you would build it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about how often you use it,</v>

1207
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1208
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 1>You use your legs constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't use your arms constantly,</v>

1209
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but if you did and you built up over </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of time,</v>

1210
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's obviously the shipping is</v>

1211
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:18.380
<v Speaker 1>quick to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1212
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I started doing hand actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>right before I broke my foot.</v>

1213
00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I started when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be able to pretty much walk in</v>

1214
00:51:24.361 --> 00:51:25.194
<v Speaker 1>and listen on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you walk on your hands while </v>

1215
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:27.250
<v Speaker 1>your foot was broken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1216
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that week I was like,</v>

1217
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.013
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I could walk for </v>

1218
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 1>minutes at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hands,</v>

1219
00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get back into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started training that week.</v>

1220
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I just started doing handstands </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday with my friend's daughter.</v>

1221
00:51:37.611 --> 00:51:38.444
<v Speaker 1>You broke your foot right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The week I broke my leg for the two </v>

1222
00:51:39.861 --> 00:51:40.694
<v Speaker 1>weeks before I broke my foot and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started like quickly I could feel the </v>

1223
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 1>skill coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:47.083
<v Speaker 1>I mean I probably should have kept with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because then I could have walked </v>

1225
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 1>around for a while and kept my foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

1226
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1227
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:51.914
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is that like pretty quickly </v>

1228
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 1>your body starts to attune to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1229
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to do pushups on the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wrist,</v>

1230
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 1>this buddy of mine who was into martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>

1231
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do risk pushups.</v>

1232
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:01.814
<v Speaker 1>And what's the benefit of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just saying to strengthen your </v>

1233
00:52:03.561 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1234
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:05.264
<v Speaker 1>He used to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first time I did it it really </v>

1235
00:52:06.921 --> 00:52:07.754
<v Speaker 1>hurt my wrists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after about a week of doing it </v>

1236
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 1>didn't hurt my wrists anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body just kind of adjust?</v>

1237
00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.013
<v Speaker 1>But I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to start doing </v>

1239
00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>handstands and doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Burmese a volleyball thing.</v>

1240
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:22.630
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1241
00:52:22.631 --> 00:52:25.250
<v Speaker 1>what were you on crutches or you want a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheelchair?</v>

1242
00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Like how long did it take before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually walk a broken foot?</v>

1243
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.180
<v Speaker 1>While I was walking a little too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1244
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.860
<v Speaker 1>How long I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't break it,</v>

1245
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't displace the bones any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I actually wrote,</v>

1246
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a couple of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six weeks later.</v>

1247
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1248
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.493
<v Speaker 1>I probably would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because we built this wave of like </v>

1249
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.510
<v Speaker 1>a up in your fresno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We built a manmade wave and um,</v>

1250
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 1>are those a good way to learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1252
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:53.924
<v Speaker 1>they can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it depends on how long the wave </v>

1253
00:52:55.611 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 1>lasts and what size wave and how fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that kind of thing,</v>

1254
00:52:58.131 --> 00:52:59.760
<v Speaker 1>but our way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy to learn on,</v>

1255
00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but our wave lasts on the low speed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a beginner.</v>

1256
00:53:03.261 --> 00:53:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It lasts over a minute long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would seem to me that,</v>

1257
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 1>that would be a great way to like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your feet wet.</v>

1258
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1259
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you should come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it right there?</v>

1260
00:53:12.081 --> 00:53:12.914
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the low side at least </v>

1261
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.720
<v Speaker 1>what's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1262
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 1>as the high setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 1>This was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was actually.</v>

1264
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:19.423
<v Speaker 1>Where is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a like 40 minutes south of </v>

1265
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Fresno area?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1266
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:24.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be a ski like,</v>

1267
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 1>so it's long narrow lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1268
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 1>that's all manmade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is manmade.</v>

1270
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the newest version of it.</v>

1271
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.620
<v Speaker 1>If you were to google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to search,</v>

1272
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:38.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1273
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a contest called,</v>

1274
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.543
<v Speaker 1>we had a couple of contests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had one called the surf ranch pro </v>

1275
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.260
<v Speaker 1>about six weeks ago and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we changed the waves since then and uh,</v>

1276
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>we remodeled that we had to rebuild it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1277
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1278
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:55.883
<v Speaker 1>the reason I surfed was because we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the first competition at this </v>

1279
00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:00.590
<v Speaker 1>wave and I wanted to ride the first way </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1280
00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want get to compete.</v>

1281
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.053
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically I wanted to ride the wave </v>

1282
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:07.290
<v Speaker 1>at the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does this work?</v>

1283
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.250
<v Speaker 1>What's making that wave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a coil,</v>

1284
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.253
<v Speaker 1>a wave foil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a in the back it looks sometimes </v>

1285
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you'll see in the back behind the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not there,</v>

1286
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but to the left side more you would see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>

1287
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:18.744
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a super inefficient boat </v>

1288
00:54:20.861 --> 00:54:21.694
<v Speaker 1>hole and it pushes through the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's pushing water instead of </v>

1289
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:26.070
<v Speaker 1>planning on the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would want a boat too.</v>

1290
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's pushing all the water sideways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just this foil shape.</v>

1291
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:34.470
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the shape of a finn or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wing straight up and down in the water</v>

1292
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 1>is that blue thing in the back and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rides.</v>

1293
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:41.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like a rollercoaster and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets pulled on a pulley system with a</v>

1294
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:43.470
<v Speaker 1>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower engine.</v>

1295
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.370
<v Speaker 1>There's two of them actually wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go either direction.</v>

1296
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:49.800
<v Speaker 1>So you see it's now they've got their </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the wave when they're riding,</v>

1297
00:54:49.801 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 1>but the first few ways they showed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Stephanie Gilmore.</v>

1298
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:55.180
<v Speaker 1>She's like six time world champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1299
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.470
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's me obviously.</v>

1300
00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And this was just about six weeks ago in</v>
<v Speaker 1>September.</v>

1301
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1302
00:55:05.401 --> 00:55:06.234
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1303
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.133
<v Speaker 1>I designed the technology with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist and then design the actual </v>

1304
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:14.340
<v Speaker 1>brief bottom or concrete bottom that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes the wave break.</v>

1305
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this seems way more advanced </v>

1306
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>than the ones that I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really advanced way.</v>

1308
00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It's actually longer than it needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1309
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:21.144
<v Speaker 1>Also [inaudible] at a fast speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waste to like 45 seconds and your </v>

1310
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:26.750
<v Speaker 1>legs are fried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Philippe Toledo,</v>

1311
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 1>who's number two in the world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's unbelievable.</v>

1312
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy fast.</v>

1313
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Great Surfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's he from?</v>

1314
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of surfers come from Brazil.</v>

1315
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 1>All the new good guys are from Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the flight or fight game,</v>

1316
00:55:40.711 --> 00:55:41.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a Gabriel Medina guy's </v>

1317
00:55:43.651 --> 00:55:44.730
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

1318
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 1>he's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1319
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And he's a fucking balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1320
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 1>that's probably shove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that was a corrupt flip.</v>

1322
00:55:54.031 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>He did super high tech moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>

1323
00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Gabriel Medina is one time world champ </v>
<v Speaker 1>from few years ago,</v>

1324
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:03.050
<v Speaker 1>but I thought he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1325
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:03.893
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was just going to win year </v>
<v Speaker 1>after year after year after his first </v>

1326
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:06.624
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it got complacent or </v>

1327
00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:11.250
<v Speaker 1>what happened and he and I aren't super </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1328
00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>how do they judge like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a subjective.</v>

1329
00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1330
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:17.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the probably the tough thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>our sport,</v>

1331
00:56:17.421 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but I mean gymnastics is subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1332
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 1>ice skating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1333
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1334
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's not too different to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not too dissimilar to that.</v>

1335
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:26.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1336
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 1>the judges are all good surfers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively good surfers.</v>

1337
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1338
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:36.121
<v Speaker 1>guys who know what is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a wave and I'm there,</v>

1339
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:38.740
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy for them to compare </v>
<v Speaker 1>apples to oranges,</v>

1340
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 1>a different person skills over the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1341
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be interesting in UFC,</v>

1342
00:56:44.141 --> 00:56:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1343
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 1>if you had judges subjectively judging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1344
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.340
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily like who won the round </v>
<v Speaker 1>or looking at counts,</v>

1345
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.183
<v Speaker 1>but like who styled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like how fast and how much power did </v>

1346
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:54.810
<v Speaker 1>he have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did he link is,</v>

1347
00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strikes together.</v>

1348
00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Just a subjective element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately,</v>

1349
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 1>unlike surfing the is not the judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

1350
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:07.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not comprised of former fighters </v>
<v Speaker 1>were people that really know a lot of,</v>

1351
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.810
<v Speaker 1>which is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally wrong.</v>

1352
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some,</v>

1353
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:12.843
<v Speaker 1>some surfers really believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>judges should just be x pros that were </v>

1354
00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:16.204
<v Speaker 1>tour level guys that make those calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's enough of those </v>

1355
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 1>guys out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

1356
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 1>there may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1357
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:24.244
<v Speaker 1>getting back to why that kind of leads </v>
<v Speaker 1>me back to like you asked why guys </v>

1358
00:57:27.251 --> 00:57:30.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the longevity that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get married,</v>

1359
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 1>have kids and have a life back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that kind of stuff.</v>

1360
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:35.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1361
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of not quite the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>route with all that stuff.</v>

1362
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:40.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had a lot more time focused </v>

1363
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:43.504
<v Speaker 1>dedication into what I was doing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do it for a long time because </v>

1364
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I just love surfing and I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had my druthers every day I'm gonna</v>

1365
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:51.183
<v Speaker 1>wake up and go ride waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is there a point system that this </v>

1366
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Koran Yep.</v>

1367
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Out of 10 out of 10 boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody gets a nine.</v>

1368
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:01.450
<v Speaker 1>If they lose that battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1369
00:58:01.451 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 is the Max tens Max,</v>

1370
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:04.414
<v Speaker 1>but I mean more average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing threes and fours than you </v>

1371
00:58:06.251 --> 00:58:07.084
<v Speaker 1>are eights and nines because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a certain wave in a certain </v>

1372
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 1>skill set gets you up to that excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

1373
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:16.990
<v Speaker 1>So we consider eight and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

1374
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of six,</v>

1375
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:20.434
<v Speaker 1>five to eight is like really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is there a lot of debate about </v>

1376
00:58:25.091 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I have a nine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

1377
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is accurate for someone's Rod?</v>

1378
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:31.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1379
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:32.650
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1380
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's early,</v>

1381
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1382
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.713
<v Speaker 1>like if it's early in a heat and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a nine or a girl gets a nine and </v>

1383
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:44.890
<v Speaker 1>then you think that there's a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could have been done either on that</v>

1384
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:47.350
<v Speaker 1>day in those types of waves or on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave specifically.</v>

1385
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Like some occasionally you see somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>get 10 perfect.</v>

1386
00:58:50.981 --> 00:58:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Why as good as you can possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate,</v>

1387
00:58:53.351 --> 00:58:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you should remember that way forever </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>

1388
00:58:55.241 --> 00:58:56.074
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the perfect knockout but then </v>

1389
00:58:59.140 --> 00:58:59.973
<v Speaker 1>won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kick off the wave when there's </v>

1390
00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 1>more to ride or they'll fall and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>still get a 10.</v>

1391
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 1>So like sometimes you'll see somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a really good score and you know,</v>

1392
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:09.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot more could have been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could've been deeper in that tube,</v>

1393
00:59:09.971 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 1>they could have been higher in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

1394
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:12.670
<v Speaker 1>they could have rotated it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1395
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:13.504
<v Speaker 1>more they could in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have written out like </v>

1396
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 1>smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have linked a couple different,</v>

1397
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 1>more difficult turns together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>added more variety.</v>

1398
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So you have to kind of like if anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>scaled down,</v>

1399
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I think as a judge as opposed to scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>up because then you,</v>

1400
00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.550
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're surfing in really great waves,</v>

1401
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 1>which makes it easier to get a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>score.</v>

1402
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So like Tropo in Tahiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1403
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:36.314
<v Speaker 1>if you pull up Tahiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm show poor t a h u t o m contest </v>

1404
00:59:45.321 --> 00:59:46.154
<v Speaker 1>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had really unbelievable waves in </v>

1405
00:59:48.921 --> 00:59:49.754
<v Speaker 1>this contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost every wave looked like it </v>

1406
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.054
<v Speaker 1>could be a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it comes down to like how late did </v>

1407
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you drop in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How critical was it?</v>

1408
00:59:56.661 --> 00:59:57.494
<v Speaker 1>How deep were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you maximize your time in there </v>

1409
00:59:59.501 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 1>by slowing your speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much risk did you take?</v>

1410
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So even though they've only lasted about</v>
<v Speaker 1>five seconds,</v>

1411
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole lot that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>condensed into that five seconds.</v>

1412
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And did you wait for one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves or did you take a smaller wave and</v>

1413
01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 1>take and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1414
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:14.803
<v Speaker 1>a little bit easier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like when one of those giant </v>

1415
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>tubes crashes down on top of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1416
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this game,</v>

1417
01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1418
01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>he ended up winning the contest.</v>

1419
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not super fun when you eat.</v>

1420
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>It could imagine that you've probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to Shane.</v>

1421
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>That's me actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1422
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to Shannon about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1424
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's more of an authority than Shane</v>

1425
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not in the super hollow,</v>

1426
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1427
01:00:40.911 --> 01:00:41.744
<v Speaker 1>Shane writes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the biggest waves in the world </v>

1428
01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:43.964
<v Speaker 1>changes the authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's had wipe outs that he came </v>

1429
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:47.834
<v Speaker 1>close to dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably talked to about their vest </v>

1430
01:00:49.611 --> 01:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>he created because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he almost drowned.</v>

1431
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>He created a vest that you pull the co </v>
<v Speaker 1>two cartridge and it bless,</v>

1432
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big bladder and lift you to the </v>

1433
01:00:56.691 --> 01:00:57.524
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you get knocked out or taken </v>

1434
01:00:58.631 --> 01:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to find you and probably</v>

1435
01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>save you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1436
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is me there.</v>

1437
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't make that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't even a big one.</v>

1438
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not that for that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a small way of fucking huge.</v>

1439
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>The one that's coming down to see where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at.</v>

1440
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of in blue water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1441
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>So I was able to dive and kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 1>under it and not get sucked back over.</v>

1442
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>So there's a little bit of a skill that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes with wiping out.</v>

1443
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>So you understand that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1444
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

1445
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tornado or a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the eye wall is the worst.</v>

1446
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>But your fear in the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

1447
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

1448
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.493
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you follow a hurricane inside the </v>

1449
01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:33.014
<v Speaker 1>center of the eye?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like could you just stay with it and be </v>

1450
01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could.</v>

1451
01:01:35.811 --> 01:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>If you moved to a really slow speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

1452
01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:38.864
<v Speaker 1>don't move them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only move about 10 to 20 miles an </v>

1453
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

1454
01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes less kind of playing go that </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>

1455
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you could stay in the car,</v>

1456
01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like know,</v>

1457
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>find a road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a really good gps system,</v>

1458
01:01:49.851 --> 01:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1459
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:52.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1460
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go northwest,</v>

1461
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:54.700
<v Speaker 1>go northeast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1462
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to go off road or </v>

1463
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1464
01:01:58.221 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>So that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that energy is in where the lip,</v>

1465
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1466
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the center that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty safe.</v>

1467
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you get sucked in right </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the wall,</v>

1468
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get pitched in the limb,</v>

1469
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>that's when the lips spreads the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it hits and it sends you right down</v>

1470
01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:11.564
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a place like this where </v>

1471
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see a way that's real hollow,</v>

1472
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>it's generally a lot shallower than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is high.</v>

1473
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>So the wave will be 15 feet in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

1474
01:02:20.851 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>might only be five or six feet deep.</v>

1475
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>So think of all that energy it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hit.</v>

1476
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Most of it's going to hit the reef at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>

1477
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

1478
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you want to try to kind of fall like </v>
<v Speaker 1>where that lives landing and then escape</v>

1479
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>under it into blue water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1480
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to hit a reef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of just breaks,</v>

1481
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hit your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1482
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>for the most part you can tell up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1483
01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you lose your equilibrium a </v>

1484
01:02:46.021 --> 01:02:46.854
<v Speaker 1>little bit underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part you can tell what </v>

1485
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>is up and down so you can feel it </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

1486
01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to put my arms there </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I take it on my head.</v>

1487
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like trying to be like a cat,</v>

1488
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>like when I hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to,</v>

1489
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll break my hands or feet or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1490
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about that.</v>

1491
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1492
01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:02.431
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1493
01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 1>So I think everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a default is to try to cover your head.</v>

1494
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 1>if you hit anywhere else you're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1496
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want to hit your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the waves come crashing down on</v>

1497
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:15.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you lose your sense of up and down?</v>

1498
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:17.310
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.140
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1500
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you also have your board connected from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the leash and that's usually,</v>

1501
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that's generally going to pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of know,</v>

1502
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't feel you're aboard pulling,</v>

1503
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of worried like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1504
01:03:31.231 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>my board might hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might spare me underwater.</v>

1505
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:34.103
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can occasionally get spirit in the </v>

1506
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:37.860
<v Speaker 1>face with your board or fin or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of spooky.</v>

1507
01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:39.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was surfing with a guy who's like a </v>

1508
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>big brother and I used to travel with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Carroll.</v>

1509
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:43.883
<v Speaker 1>He's a two time world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're surfing Tahiti one time together </v>

1510
01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>and he used to wear a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys,</v>

1511
01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't wear a helmet,</v>

1512
01:03:49.141 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but tom used to wear a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was real really used to it.</v>

1513
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:53.310
<v Speaker 1>But having something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1514
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>an extra say inch around your head or </v>
<v Speaker 1>half inch,</v>

1515
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:58.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes your judgment a little.</v>

1516
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>So you got to be used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like it was weird.</v>

1517
01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 1>It's weird for aspiring to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucks with your peripheral vision.</v>

1518
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>So it would mess with me when I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear them and that extra weight and like</v>

1520
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>when we're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a critical way of.</v>

1521
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to pull in the barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1522
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>we are dealing with inches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1523
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:16.223
<v Speaker 1>percentage of inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just tucking your head into that </v>

1524
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.753
<v Speaker 1>lip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you gotta you gotta kind of be </v>

1525
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:20.664
<v Speaker 1>really aware of your range and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to like Tuck your head at </v>

1526
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:24.534
<v Speaker 1>certain places and I was never </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with it but certainly with </v>

1527
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Tom and he wiped out and his board </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit him in the ear and it broke,</v>

1528
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 1>it broke the helmet and broke his ear </v>
<v Speaker 1>drum Jesus.</v>

1529
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:35.933
<v Speaker 1>So we were just wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell would have happened if he </v>

1530
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:39.170
<v Speaker 1>didn't have his helmet on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1531
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>like probably would've killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1532
01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:42.483
<v Speaker 1>would it definitely knocked them out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have a jet ski with us that </v>

1533
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.953
<v Speaker 1>day or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

1534
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 yards or more off the beach,</v>

1535
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>half mile off the beach somewhere at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wreath.</v>

1536
01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.793
<v Speaker 1>And blow your ear drum like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to get it surgically </v>

1537
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:54.360
<v Speaker 1>repaired?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1538
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1539
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.533
<v Speaker 1>I think I've never just let it heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost busted my eardrum like six </v>

1540
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just free dive in.</v>

1541
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I felt it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pinhole leak.</v>

1542
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.693
<v Speaker 1>I could feel it like going and I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>got dizzy and I just came up and stop </v>

1543
01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>diving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1544
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.520
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1545
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I've got a buddy named Greg Long.</v>

1546
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has drowned and he been attacked by a</v>

1547
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Too many people can say those things</v>

1548
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>and he's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get saved when he drowned?</v>

1549
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really crazy story,</v>

1550
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.393
<v Speaker 1>but I'll just talk about one sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he did break his ear drum at </v>

1551
01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>mavericks up in northern California and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

1552
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>you just flounder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you think.</v>

1553
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>You're swimming one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1554
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.413
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your boats turn in and you </v>

1555
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>don't know which there was no rudder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1556
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what's up and down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1557
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:45.043
<v Speaker 1>you think you're something up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going sideways and it's really </v>

1558
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:47.970
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

1559
01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.913
<v Speaker 1>there was guy in Hawaii a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago that drone surfing an outer </v>

1560
01:05:51.521 --> 01:05:52.354
<v Speaker 1>reef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and a friend of mine caught a wave </v>

1561
01:05:53.981 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and this guy wiped out.</v>

1562
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.980
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have all he had with surf </v>
<v Speaker 1>trunks and generally will wear like even</v>

1563
01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 1>a wetsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just then,</v>

1564
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:02.764
<v Speaker 1>but it keeps you warm and even that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough flotation to where if you'd got </v>

1565
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.140
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably come to the surface.</v>

1566
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So this guy wiped out his leash broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he lost his board and then we think,</v>

1567
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys who are out there think that he</v>

1568
01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.693
<v Speaker 1>popped his eardrum because they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>they saw him hit the surface and start </v>

1569
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>like his feet were coming up and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand was coming up and you know,</v>

1570
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.333
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of just floundering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next wave hit and they </v>

1571
01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:28.500
<v Speaker 1>never saw him again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was only in surf trunks.</v>

1572
01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:30.510
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't ever find the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1573
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't float up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he just had it,</v>

1574
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.490
<v Speaker 1>even just a wet suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just some neoprene ever found the bomb,</v>

1575
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 1>didn't find him.</v>

1576
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>The waves were huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1577
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:37.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like 40,</v>

1578
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>50 foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1579
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 1>But it was really unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a real.</v>

1580
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.743
<v Speaker 1>Those things are really like sobering in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surf community because we all know </v>

1581
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:50.770
<v Speaker 1>each other and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1582
01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:53.950
<v Speaker 1>ultimately you're doing this for fun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1583
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1584
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a heavy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's crazy that your eardrum affects</v>

1585
01:06:58.571 --> 01:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>you that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1586
01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.543
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people that have inner ear </v>

1587
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>infections and they'll get dizzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking.</v>

1588
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.493
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're one front in front of the </v>

1589
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to fall sideways.</v>

1590
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so greg,</v>

1592
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.633
<v Speaker 1>Greg Long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drowned actually at a place called </v>

1593
01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:14.824
<v Speaker 1>Cortez Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about 120 miles off the coast </v>

1594
01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>of Dana Point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a re.</v>

1595
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It's basically that the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain on an island that never hit the</v>

1596
01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.404
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

1597
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:24.603
<v Speaker 1>And it was discovered when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a nuclear ship actually </v>

1598
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>grounded itself on that reef back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1599
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.880
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago or something and caused a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>

1600
01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.730
<v Speaker 1>caused tens of millions of dollars of </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage to the ship navy ship.</v>

1601
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

1602
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they had sounded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom by then.</v>

1603
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It must not have known it was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1604
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.213
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wave breaks when it's really big </v>

1605
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane's been out there.</v>

1606
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Shane was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Shane was out there this day,</v>

1607
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>not positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure Shane was out during</v>

1608
01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 1>this session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's about 15 guys out,</v>

1609
01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.950
<v Speaker 1>doesn't guys out and Greg took off on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave and a,</v>

1610
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>somebody who in front of him on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave,</v>

1611
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>which kind of changed his angle a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

1612
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:08.014
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would've made the wave </v>

1613
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 1>anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just puts them in a little bit of</v>

1614
01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>a precarious situation.</v>

1615
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he ate it.</v>

1616
01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.733
<v Speaker 1>It was down a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wave has just so much energy in it </v>

1617
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:22.640
<v Speaker 1>because there's nothing between where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wave started and this break,</v>

1618
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.390
<v Speaker 1>like it's thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet deep that,</v>

1619
01:08:25.391 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the whole Pacific.</v>

1620
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's no continental shelf to slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wave down.</v>

1621
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Know if you can imagine the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have small waves.</v>

1622
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:34.603
<v Speaker 1>A big part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that is because most of the </v>

1623
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>storms go west to east and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>come towards us.</v>

1624
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.273
<v Speaker 1>But even on a hurricane are our surf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that big because we have a </v>

1625
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>continental shelf that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go out,</v>

1626
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>you can go out 20 miles and it's 70 feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep someplaces.</v>

1627
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>So the swells just drag in the Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't drag,</v>

1628
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:52.484
<v Speaker 1>there's just nothing to get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these wells are going 35 miles an </v>

1629
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:56.174
<v Speaker 1>hour when they hit.</v>

1630
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot faster than a normal wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's all this energy and the wave.</v>

1631
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And so when Greg went down and this wave</v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably a 40 foot face or whatever,</v>

1632
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:04.214
<v Speaker 1>50 face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was underwater and he's really </v>

1633
01:09:06.831 --> 01:09:07.640
<v Speaker 1>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1634
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably as,</v>

1635
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>as ready for anybody in big surf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's totally prepared.</v>

1636
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:13.543
<v Speaker 1>He's done all the CPR and breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses and everything and he was real </v>

1637
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 1>calm and he said he pulled his vest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work.</v>

1638
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.473
<v Speaker 1>And then he pulled another one and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work and he pulled it a third </v>

1639
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 1>time and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>

1640
01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed.</v>

1641
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1642
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.270
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>

1643
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.860
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start to pull it,</v>

1644
01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're already in a little bit of a,</v>

1645
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:34.363
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guys pull it right away just to be </v>

1646
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:36.680
<v Speaker 1>safe when a big wave.</v>

1647
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:37.933
<v Speaker 1>But some guys kind of wait and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see if I'm able to pull this one </v>

1648
01:09:40.101 --> 01:09:40.934
<v Speaker 1>off and I'll save my little canister </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you only have like some of the </v>

1649
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 1>vets have to earth two canisters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some have four.</v>

1650
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to have to change your</v>
<v Speaker 1>canisters over.</v>

1651
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So if you're thinking going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1652
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get back to the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay?</v>

1653
01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You can handle it and you got a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

1654
01:09:55.051 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

1655
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.653
<v Speaker 1>I won't pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he pulled three times and then he </v>

1656
01:09:57.921 --> 01:09:58.754
<v Speaker 1>blacked out and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily it had really good water safety </v>

1657
01:10:02.961 --> 01:10:03.794
<v Speaker 1>crew and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it was his brother </v>

1658
01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:07.574
<v Speaker 1>that saved them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a couple of the guys went and </v>

1659
01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:10.790
<v Speaker 1>grabbed dove in and pull them up by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leash.</v>

1660
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.313
<v Speaker 1>Luckily he was to the least because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't floating because he didn't have </v>

1661
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:15.284
<v Speaker 1>the CEO too.</v>

1662
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>And then he had taken a lot of water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1663
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:20.503
<v Speaker 1>they had to airlift him off the boat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>height and big seas that night after </v>

1664
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 1>dark and got him back to the mainland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did they do cpr on him?</v>

1665
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.150
<v Speaker 1>They did CPR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1666
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the come back to consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back to consciousness,</v>

1667
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>but he was like awake when the airlift </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody gets fucked up.</v>

1668
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But guys can have secondary drowning.</v>

1669
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have water in the lungs and </v>

1670
01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you're not aware of the symptoms or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1671
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1672
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pump it off it out.</v>

1673
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:47.170
<v Speaker 1>They can't just hang by your ankles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1674
01:10:47.171 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they pump it out.</v>

1675
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.273
<v Speaker 1>I was with a buddy in Australia a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half ago and then he almost </v>

1676
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 1>drowned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got knocked out his board,</v>

1677
01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:56.570
<v Speaker 1>hit him in the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out cold.</v>

1678
01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1679
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting out the back waiting for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave and I heard everyone kind of,</v>

1680
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:03.963
<v Speaker 1>I heard another friend screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily the waves kind of stopped and </v>

1681
01:11:06.591 --> 01:11:07.424
<v Speaker 1>they were able to get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull them up on a jet ski and he had </v>

1682
01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>taken it in some water and he's puking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and coffin and all this stuff and I came</v>

1683
01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:17.550
<v Speaker 1>up from behind and I didn't see his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

1684
01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I heard,</v>

1685
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I heard one of the guys say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1686
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>he got his board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him in the neck and the throat,</v>

1687
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 1>and so I was expecting this artery be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut or like the throat to be open.</v>

1688
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1689
01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1690
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.140
<v Speaker 1>because I was behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get it to go around him</v>

1691
01:11:34.141 --> 01:11:34.951
<v Speaker 1>and try to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1692
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:36.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get him into the beach.</v>

1693
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Luckily we had a jet ski because we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a mile off shore.</v>

1694
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1695
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I held on the jet ski and kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just squeezed on behalf on the.</v>

1696
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 1>We have a sled on the back of the jet </v>
<v Speaker 1>ski,</v>

1697
01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.940
<v Speaker 1>like a body big giant bodyboard with </v>
<v Speaker 1>handles.</v>

1698
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So I just kind of straddled him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My other friend rode the ski all the way</v>

1699
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 1>up on the beach and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1700
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:54.960
<v Speaker 1>when we get the beach I'm going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>

1701
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:57.420
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be gory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But luckily he wasn't opened up.</v>

1702
01:11:57.421 --> 01:12:00.750
<v Speaker 1>He just had a huge hematoma here on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck and he,</v>

1703
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it didn't slice him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just like contusion,</v>

1704
01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 1>like blunt force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very lucky.</v>

1705
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he spent two or three days in the </v>

1706
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:09.990
<v Speaker 1>hospital because they were worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary drowning,</v>

1707
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 1>which I don't exactly know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary drowning means,</v>

1708
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.010
<v Speaker 1>but I guess when you have water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

1709
01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:15.900
<v Speaker 1>water in your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

1710
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:17.483
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe from the way you laid down or I </v>

1711
01:12:19.371 --> 01:12:20.204
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably be super school </v>

1712
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 1>mistakes you're living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1713
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It never ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1719
01:12:39.451 --> 01:12:40.284
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anyone in the world I meet is </v>

1720
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:42.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1721
01:12:42.671 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Told me about that story.</v>

1722
01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't ever end that story like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>primal fear,</v>

1723
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.910
<v Speaker 1>like getting eaten by a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1724
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:52.523
<v Speaker 1>you feel so vulnerable in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you feel less vulnerable </v>

1725
01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:58.260
<v Speaker 1>because you're bored and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>board knew so quick with the board,</v>

1726
01:12:58.710 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but like someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1727
01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.553
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are totally vulnerable if a great </v>

1728
01:13:02.221 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 1>white one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1729
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:04.580
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

1730
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.480
<v Speaker 1>if a shark over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1731
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:09.810
<v Speaker 1>even if a six foot shark wants you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the,</v>

1732
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1733
01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:12.570
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1734
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:15.510
<v Speaker 1>shark death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1735
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.390
<v Speaker 1>jaws just fucked everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was seven or something when,</v>

1736
01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:23.460
<v Speaker 1>when I was six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when jaws came out and I watched</v>

1737
01:13:23.461 --> 01:13:23.761
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I watched brick poltergeist when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

1739
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 1>My parents let me watch everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine to.</v>

1740
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why I always thought there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was some boogeyman in the closet,</v>

1741
01:13:33.391 --> 01:13:34.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1742
01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:37.860
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps your prepared.</v>

1743
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why I started training with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dragon,</v>

1744
01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1745
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so jaws,</v>

1746
01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even go in the deep end of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>

1747
01:13:45.511 --> 01:13:46.344
<v Speaker 1>I was so freaked out that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a shark at the deep </v>

1748
01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 1>end somewhere and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would only stay in the shallow end for</v>

1749
01:13:51.871 --> 01:13:53.880
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years when I was like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>or six,</v>

1750
01:13:53.881 --> 01:13:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1751
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1752
01:13:57.421 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 1>so greg got to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was all right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They put these courses together a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>times a year,</v>

1772
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:47.770

<v Speaker 1>world are already surfers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

1782
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Some guy in the coast guard's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>not gonna be able to do the same.</v>

1783
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Like they might help your boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

1784
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not trying to put coast guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys down at all in any way.</v>

1785
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.010

<v Speaker 1>So how often do you actually see shorts?</v>

1789
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Depends where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Florida,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I see sharks almost daily.</v>

1799
01:15:58.271 --> 01:15:59.590
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

1800
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:00.603
<v Speaker 1>when I first started making money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that would be cool to have a </v>

1801
01:16:02.111 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 1>little place in each place I go that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of based out of so I can be feeling</v>

1802
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:07.084
<v Speaker 1>like home on the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing is like I've </v>

1803

1804
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make the world like my home </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>

1805
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I just love traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love meeting people everywhere.</v>

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:13.700
<v Speaker 1>That's those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talk about sharks.</v>

1830
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Sharks don't hunt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might bite you if they see you,</v>

1831
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:17.714
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1832
01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1833
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.250
<v Speaker 1>a saltwater croc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing is watching you.</v>

1834
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.113
<v Speaker 1>It can feel you walking in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It knows from that vibration how close </v>

1835
01:17:25.731 --> 01:17:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you are to the water's edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It knows exactly.</v>

1836
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:28.873
<v Speaker 1>I can pinpoint it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can pinpoint to the waters edge where </v>

1837
01:17:31.761 --> 01:17:32.594
<v Speaker 1>you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:33.703
<v Speaker 1>That noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Adam Green tree lives in </v>

1839
01:17:35.031 --> 01:17:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Australia and he's not all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1840
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:39.310
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1841
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.153
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do Your House.</v>

1842
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:40.551
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1843
01:17:40.551 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 1>They're waiting for you at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket.</v>

1844
01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:43.653
<v Speaker 1>But they do keep track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know that the closest one to the </v>

1845
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:46.844
<v Speaker 1>Gold Coast where I'm from is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still like 300 miles north or </v>

1846
01:17:49.491 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 1>something like 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1847
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:52.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like the closest saltwater crocs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.620
<v Speaker 1>They keep a track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1849
01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty visual and about how,</v>

1850
01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:59.210
<v Speaker 1>where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what rivers they would be.</v>

1851
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Because I got to warn people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't swim here.</v>

1852
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stupid and they die.</v>

1853
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:04.993
<v Speaker 1>But like a crock snuck on to just sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of give you an exploratory bite like a </v>

1854
01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:09.390
<v Speaker 1>great white might in review.</v>

1855
01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 1>They're going to snatch you and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1856
01:18:12.711 --> 01:18:15.260
<v Speaker 1>and they're not going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surfboard in the way from the underbite,</v>

1857
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna.</v>

1858
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 1>There was a horrible story that I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1859
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a national geographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1860
01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>These two people that were kayaking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the river in Africa and this guy was the</v>

1861
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.730
<v Speaker 1>guy went with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

1862
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 1>This might be a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what story did you hear?</v>

1863
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.013
<v Speaker 1>This one was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two guys were going to do a first </v>

1864
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:34.250
<v Speaker 1>descent down this thing and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacting another guy who had done that</v>

1865
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:35.390
<v Speaker 1>river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an American guy,</v>

1866
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>and the American guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't miss this descent.</v>

1867
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do that whole river.</v>

1868
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:42.523
<v Speaker 1>And then the three of them got into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone where they're just everywhere in </v>

1869
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:48.440
<v Speaker 1>the river was real slow and wide and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as they got there,</v>

1870
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:51.740
<v Speaker 1>all the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the crux came off the river bank and</v>

1871
01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

1872
01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.593
<v Speaker 1>There's like tons of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's theory was to take his </v>

1873
01:18:55.701 --> 01:18:56.534
<v Speaker 1>helmet and throw it off to the side so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like movement and distract </v>

1874
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:00.520
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd attack that and he paddled to</v>

1875
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:01.363
<v Speaker 1>shore and all three of them got together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the American guy was on the right </v>

1876
01:19:04.641 --> 01:19:06.800
<v Speaker 1>side and the other two guys were </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they were so close.</v>

1877
01:19:06.801 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 1>They see like the guy in the middle like</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't really paddle.</v>

1878
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.590
<v Speaker 1>He would just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1879
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:11.503
<v Speaker 1>trying to move along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they figured if the bigger we </v>

1880
01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:14.864
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger we look and more </v>

1881
01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 1>intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it will be okay.</v>

1882
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 foot crop comes up,</v>

1883
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:21.950
<v Speaker 1>grabs the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes him out of his,</v>

1884
01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.150
<v Speaker 1>pulls them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Kayak disappears,</v>

1885
01:19:23.151 --> 01:19:25.430
<v Speaker 1>they never see him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His backpack floats up.</v>

1886
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And then this stuff's floating down </v>
<v Speaker 1>downstream.</v>

1887
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.620
<v Speaker 1>The other two guys get out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1888
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:31.933
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm telling the story pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good because I read it like five times </v>

1889
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:35.623
<v Speaker 1>online too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they got other water and then there </v>

1890
01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:41.920
<v Speaker 1>was a little village just down and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little bridge over and they had,</v>

1891
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:42.853
<v Speaker 1>there were some boats when the boats </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all dry docked and they went down </v>

1892
01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:48.260
<v Speaker 1>and in broken English it was one person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could talk to him or whatever.</v>

1893
01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.094
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know our boats are not in the water </v>

1894
01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.293
<v Speaker 1>because there's too many crocs here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we know not to go in the water </v>

1895
01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.160
<v Speaker 1>because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a boat.</v>

1896
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:57.170
<v Speaker 1>We got to find his body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to try and save him,</v>

1897
01:19:57.171 --> 01:19:58.004
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they went to the bridge and </v>

1898
01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:02.300
<v Speaker 1>watch this stuff like float by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same story.</v>

1899
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy wasn't supposed to be on the</v>

1900
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:05.690
<v Speaker 1>trip and there was about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1901
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the Kayak flipping and then pulling</v>

1902
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.880
<v Speaker 2>his body out under the Kayak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1903
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're monsters.</v>

1904
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:15.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a show called.</v>

1905
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.453
<v Speaker 2>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a show called uncharted by what </v>

1906
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you've seen that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Jim shockey is Florida.</v>

1907
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 15 foot fucking alligator they </v>

1908
01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:29.040
<v Speaker 2>found in Florida was strolling across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the golf course.</v>

1909
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And the next day they found a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>snake,</v>

1910
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.750
<v Speaker 2>a giant rattlesnake strolling across a </v>
<v Speaker 2>golf course.</v>

1911
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of that thing I fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1912
01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:37.203
<v Speaker 2>I was friends with Steve Irwin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you said go to look at the size of </v>

1913
01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:42.780
<v Speaker 2>that thing on a golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

1914
01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:44.773
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1915
01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:46.003
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a misconstrued </v>

1916
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:47.963
<v Speaker 2>misconception about the crocs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they actually talked about this </v>

1917
01:20:50.701 --> 01:20:53.310
<v Speaker 2>because I used to be friends with Steve </v>
<v Speaker 2>Irwin before he passed away.</v>

1918
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:55.680
<v Speaker 2>He took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually had me hand feet,</v>

1919
01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:56.750
<v Speaker 2>a 13 foot crock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The concept we have about these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1937
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.660
<v Speaker 2>We just think that they're just killers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like,</v>

1943
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I kind of miss when I'm playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm playing golf.</v>

1944
01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I played a lot of golf when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>

1945
01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I always messed with the gators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll grab him by the tail.</v>

1946
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1947
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.270
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1948
01:22:09.271 --> 01:22:10.104
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun until you get your arm bit off </v>

1949
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:15.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this guy's not even.</v>

1950
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even need to backstep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1951
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:18.210
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well those are smaller.</v>

1952
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that means that going to rip your </v>

1953
01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:20.634
<v Speaker 2>arm off death roles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's so small in comparison to </v>

1954
01:22:23.131 --> 01:22:26.960
<v Speaker 2>those other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fishing in Australia in this fresh</v>

1955
01:22:26.961 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a river,</v>

1956
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but it goes down to the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So salt water crocs come up to a certain</v>

1957
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1958
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 2>There's like this dam and they don't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>past that.</v>

1959
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:37.300
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down here,</v>

1960
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 2>up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appears all the fresh water down here is</v>

1961
01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:40.104
<v Speaker 2>fresh and salt water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we saw a few 15 foot crocs this day </v>

1962
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.390
<v Speaker 2>and we're in a boat there was six feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>wide and 18 feet long,</v>

1963
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 feet long.</v>

1964
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1965
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:53.070
<v Speaker 2>the guy taking us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1966
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:54.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have problem in this boat,</v>

1967
01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:56.220
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fill out the boat,</v>

1968
01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.400
<v Speaker 2>there was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was telling us a story.</v>

1969
01:22:59.401 --> 01:23:00.234
<v Speaker 2>One day I was fishing with these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one guy standing up in the boat </v>

1970
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.590
<v Speaker 2>fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He falls out of it and the guy was about</v>

1971
01:23:04.591 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>250 pounds or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1972
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.720
<v Speaker 1>a big dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 300 pounds.</v>

1973
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:08.554
<v Speaker 1>He was like a big overweight guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell the boat and the guy said the guy </v>

1974
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 1>was in the water for about two minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was just like,</v>

1975
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 1>any second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is dead.</v>

1976
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I can do.</v>

1977
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:19.503
<v Speaker 1>And he said it was all they could do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit dead to get him from the front of </v>

1978
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to pull up up the side and</v>

1979
01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't and he was panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

1980
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people go into panic mode,</v>

1981
01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:28.534
<v Speaker 1>like when people are drowning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're panicking and they say you got </v>

1982
01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:30.604
<v Speaker 1>to punch them in the face and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock them out and calm down and they </v>

1983
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:34.203
<v Speaker 1>couldn't punch this guy like they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to get them to calm </v>

1984
01:23:36.131 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>down and then to get them all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of the boat because they had to</v>

1985
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:40.054
<v Speaker 1>get him up the transom and they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>from there they could get leverage and </v>

1986
01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:44.040
<v Speaker 1>lifting and it wouldn't flip the boat or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1987
01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 1>But he said this guy was in the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple minutes and he's like,</v>

1988
01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:48.034
<v Speaker 1>at any time there is a crock that's big </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat you within sight of us </v>

1989
01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:51.814
<v Speaker 1>here at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy said that he said that I'm </v>

1990
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:55.701
<v Speaker 1>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1991
01:23:55.701 --> 01:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I said what's the biggest one you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen?</v>

1992
01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Because we've seen 15 foot crocs like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every 20 minutes,</v>

1993
01:23:59.621 --> 01:24:01.380
<v Speaker 1>every half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 foot.</v>

1994
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Julian fricking.</v>

1995
01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're,</v>

1996
01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:06.900
<v Speaker 1>we're fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1997
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fishing for bear Monday.</v>

1998
01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2000
01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:17.430
<v Speaker 1>so we're fishing for money and I keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like,</v>

2001
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when you got one in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line is like a shark bite,</v>

2002
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that thing or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

2003
01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.260
<v Speaker 1>we start asking the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest one you ever saw?</v>

2004
01:24:23.261 --> 01:24:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

2005
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.470
<v Speaker 1>the biggest one I ever saw was about 28 </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

2006
01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:27.550
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2007
01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Twenty nine feet maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he's only seen it once.</v>

2008
01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 1>And he sought from about a kilometer </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and the estimate of the size.</v>

2009
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:34.923
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2010
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 1>these guys in a helicopter salt at once </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't stay in the river,</v>

2011
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:40.240
<v Speaker 1>it stays out in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2012
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:41.103
<v Speaker 1>it's so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it knows it's in silty water where </v>

2013
01:24:42.881 --> 01:24:45.450
<v Speaker 1>nothing can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing as big as it.</v>

2014
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It owns its territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2015
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 1>one the eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he said that the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the six foot boat.</v>

2017
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:54.190
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this thing,</v>

2018
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:55.480
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you this,</v>

2019
01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 1>how big they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2020
01:24:56.651 --> 01:24:58.810
<v Speaker 1>this one would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said if it was under our boat,</v>

2021
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 1>it would be sticking out about four to </v>
<v Speaker 1>six feet on either side across his back,</v>

2022
01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.193
<v Speaker 1>sideways.</v>

2023
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:05.343
<v Speaker 1>And we're in a six foot wide boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said it'd be like 15 foot across </v>

2024
01:25:07.570 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's back,</v>

2025
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 1>like that's how fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think of the girth.</v>

2026
01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.620
<v Speaker 1>So something that big 15 feet across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2027
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this guy told me.</v>

2028
01:25:15.971 --> 01:25:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't see it.</v>

2029
01:25:17.710 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're seeing,</v>

2030
01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:21.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 footers that are like,</v>

2031
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's girth close to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2032
01:25:23.711 --> 01:25:25.810
<v Speaker 1>like a great white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see a 15 foot great white,</v>

2033
01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it's girth is 15 feet pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so fat.</v>

2034
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they get like 10 feet,</v>

2035
01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:32.830
<v Speaker 1>then they start getting fat and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth gets about the length them.</v>

2036
01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you see a 15 or 20 foot 18 foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>great white and you measure their girth,</v>

2037
01:25:36.941 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much their length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big the crocs get.</v>

2038
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy said,</v>

2039
01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's claiming it's like mostly the</v>

2040
01:25:43.341 --> 01:25:44.174
<v Speaker 1>biggest crock in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was one they called gus or </v>

2041
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:48.004
<v Speaker 1>something in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to go late night just youtube </v>

2042
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:51.670
<v Speaker 1>this stuff when they were saying this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that had eaten,</v>

2043
01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:52.504
<v Speaker 1>like they think it's eaten over 100 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 people in these villages and they </v>

2044
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:57.550
<v Speaker 1>think it's like 23 feet long or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2045
01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:58.443
<v Speaker 1>Well this Jim shockey show that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about uncharted </v>

2046
01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Gustavo's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn him loose.</v>

2047
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking thing.</v>

2048
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 2>The Savannah King.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a perspective shot though?</v>

2049
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Look how far back those of you wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wonder.</v>

2050
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:10.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people do that with pigs and they </v>

2051
01:26:11.911 --> 01:26:12.744
<v Speaker 2>make them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that with my 28 when I catch a </v>

2052
01:26:13.821 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it right where it says 28 feet,</v>

2053
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:18.560
<v Speaker 2>four inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that makes sense.</v>

2054
01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Like what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a replica of how big it was.</v>

2055
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that thing in.</v>

2056
01:26:25.491 --> 01:26:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Everything that was alive before that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made this worse to,</v>

2057
01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to that picture jamie.</v>

2058
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:31.994
<v Speaker 2>That replica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make that larger the replica and just </v>

2059
01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 2>make that larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of that fucking thing.</v>

2060
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh well what is the largest confirmed </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones?</v>

2061
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Because if that one is 28 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four inches.</v>

2062
01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 2>The thing about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they said 28 feet,</v>

2063
01:26:48.171 --> 01:26:49.004
<v Speaker 2>four inches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like back when people were full </v>

2064
01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 2>of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:52.454
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy who told me this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>might've been trying to freak me out </v>

2066
01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2067
01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.753
<v Speaker 2>I mean because that thing is 20 feet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not 20 feet across his back or 12 </v>

2068
01:27:01.191 --> 01:27:01.660
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2069
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But another eight foot long,</v>

2070
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:05.000
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot bigger.</v>

2071
01:27:05.001 --> 01:27:05.834
<v Speaker 2>And why you see when you see like a five</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot crop or alligator and then you see </v>

2072
01:27:08.451 --> 01:27:13.020
<v Speaker 2>a 10 foot the girth relative to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>length changes at that point is.</v>

2073
01:27:13.021 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he's talking about the ratio in the</v>

2074
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:16.430
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at one point.</v>

2075
01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one.</v>

2076
01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:19.250
<v Speaker 2>What the say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one candidate.</v>

2077
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.500
<v Speaker 2>This was a list of the top 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think their largest crunch.</v>

2078
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven me.</v>

2079
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this just the species they're talking</v>

2080
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:28.670
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2081
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 2>This is just the five largest crocodiles</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever recorded.</v>

2082
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2083
01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia show the picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia 1:23</v>

2084
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:35.780
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't have a pen.</v>

2085
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:36.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

2086
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:37.270
<v Speaker 2>So there's only one that had a picture.</v>

2087
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Did you not take a picture of a 23 foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>long crocodile?</v>

2088
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:41.803
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

2089
01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Shit was big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2090
01:27:45.171 --> 01:27:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would imagine that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably bigger ones out there.</v>

2091
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I know there was a super killer croc </v>
<v Speaker 2>that went extinct that far.</v>

2092
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:54.223
<v Speaker 2>Dwarfed those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were 60 feet are enormously </v>

2093
01:27:57.710 --> 01:27:59.660
<v Speaker 2>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up that extinct.</v>

2094
01:27:59.661 --> 01:28:00.494
<v Speaker 2>Giant crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was a commercial </v>

2095
01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:03.980
<v Speaker 2>fisherman in South Africa and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2096
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.300
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the biggest check,</v>

2097
01:28:06.301 --> 01:28:08.180
<v Speaker 2>so way bigger than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2098
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to see a picture or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2099
01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:11.624
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a 60 foot boat with 10 guys </v>

2100
01:28:14.751 --> 01:28:15.584
<v Speaker 2>fishing almost a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said like everybody in the boat saw </v>

2101
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 2>the shark he had at camp next to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat.</v>

2102
01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:22.370
<v Speaker 2>There were 20 miles off of Port </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth where there's this reef,</v>

2103
01:28:22.371 --> 01:28:23.204
<v Speaker 2>they fish and he's claiming the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was more than half the length of their </v>

2104
01:28:25.731 --> 01:28:26.564
<v Speaker 2>60 foot boat.</v>

2105
01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2106
01:28:27.831 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 2>it was 35 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he tells me.</v>

2107
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.613
<v Speaker 2>What is the biggest great white like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's saying there's big jock who's </v>

2108
01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 2>stoke supposedly filled one and Cape </v>
<v Speaker 2>Verde that they didn't have anything.</v>

2109
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:40.910
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't tell the size because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have something next to it.</v>

2110
01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 2>He said it was close to 10 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 30 feet,</v>

2111
01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:45.500
<v Speaker 2>but this guy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's telling me,</v>

2112
01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:46.334
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2113
01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.473
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this shark twice out there is </v>

2114
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:50.510
<v Speaker 2>what he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I dunno.</v>

2115
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:52.280
<v Speaker 2>They're out there every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2116
01:28:52.281 --> 01:28:54.330
<v Speaker 2>How many people are out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2117
01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are the biggest ones.</v>

2118
01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:58.250
<v Speaker 2>The biggest ones are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2119
01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

2120
01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.330
<v Speaker 2>I rarely see a big shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rarely I'll see.</v>

2121
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I've seen a couple of great whites </v>
<v Speaker 2>in South Africa jump look at that thing,</v>

2122
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:06.743
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the replica of something that </v>

2123
01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 2>used to exist.</v>

2124
01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 2>12 animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're glad his fucking skull.</v>

2125
01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:15.100
<v Speaker 2>This guy's basically standing inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>skull.</v>

2126
01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.950
<v Speaker 2>This crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So freaky.</v>

2127
01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's that.</v>

2128
01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:21.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the premise of that stupid movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Meg,</v>

2129
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:22.120
<v Speaker 2>meg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meg,</v>

2130
01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.120
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't even watch it like that.</v>

2131
01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That deep blue.</v>

2132
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a shark that they were,</v>

2133
01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.320
<v Speaker 2>there were sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were training.</v>

2134
01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.393
<v Speaker 2>They were like Gmo sharks are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these genetically cloned sharks and </v>

2135
01:29:39.931 --> 01:29:42.360
<v Speaker 2>they were supposedly training them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they got too smart and they started</v>

2136
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:43.223
<v Speaker 2>eating everyone and then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the girl in the Bikini and she </v>

2137
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 2>has to take off her wetsuit because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber.</v>

2138
01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.813
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2139
01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 2>you see these movies and you just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the artistic license on these things are</v>

2140
01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 2>so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no truth to it.</v>

2141
01:29:57.331 --> 01:30:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like Samuel Jackson was in a rico </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he starts talking about.</v>

2142
01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2143
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous waters,</v>

2144
01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.490
<v Speaker 2>not dangerous use as dangerous.</v>

2145
01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:13.120
<v Speaker 3>We're going to pull together and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna find a way to get out.</v>

2146
01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Good moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

2147
01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

2148
01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:22.933
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't see that coming at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go in the water for seconds </v>

2149
01:30:27.081 --> 01:30:28.700
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that movie,</v>

2150
01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually was with Samuel l Jackson </v>

2151
01:30:31.221 --> 01:30:34.190
<v Speaker 2>like three weeks ago in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golf together.</v>

2152
01:30:35.290 --> 01:30:37.310
<v Speaker 2>How big I wanted to ask him about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>

2153
01:30:37.311 --> 01:30:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2154
01:30:39.891 --> 01:30:42.680
<v Speaker 2>how big do you think they could be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people don't know.</v>

2155
01:30:42.710 --> 01:30:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean 30 feet sounds reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they think they're 25 feet,</v>

2156
01:30:45.771 --> 01:30:48.080
<v Speaker 2>there could be one that's 30 feet maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2157
01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's reasonable to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

2158
01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:54.290
<v Speaker 2>But that's a lot more years and eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like no one saw it during that time.</v>

2159
01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's Kinda like Ufo is I got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see one.</v>

2160
01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to see an alien sharks and we know</v>

2161
01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:05.960
<v Speaker 2>they get big and we're not just how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are out there looking for them?</v>

2162
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.793
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they filmed one they call big blue </v>

2163
01:31:09.711 --> 01:31:13.010
<v Speaker 2>last year I think in Guadalupe Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

2164
01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.920
<v Speaker 2>And it was 22 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:17.750
<v Speaker 2>the videos online and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2166
01:31:17.751 --> 01:31:18.650
<v Speaker 2>a big day look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2167
01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:19.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing's face and nose looks small </v>

2168
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.713
<v Speaker 2>because the body is so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must've been a pregnant female or </v>

2169
01:31:23.841 --> 01:31:24.674
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's body looks like even bigger </v>

2170
01:31:26.901 --> 01:31:28.620
<v Speaker 2>around in the length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said it was 20.</v>

2171
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:34.410
<v Speaker 2>She like it's face almost looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>small to fuck.</v>

2172
01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the girth girth is so foiled.</v>

2173
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Smartest Shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven meters.</v>

2174
01:31:41.181 --> 01:31:42.460
<v Speaker 2>So that's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 feet,</v>

2175
01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:45.560
<v Speaker 2>23 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the,</v>

2176
01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.200
<v Speaker 2>this guy touches it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes out of the cage and touch it.</v>

2177
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>

2178
01:31:52.551 --> 01:31:55.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the shark feeding freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this guy touched it,</v>

2179
01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:56.600
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just comes out and he's like,</v>

2180
01:31:56.601 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I gotta touch this creature and I got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of there bitch,</v>

2181
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:01.343
<v Speaker 2>but she like his face almost like small </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to how a massive so scary that </v>

2182
01:32:06.641 --> 01:32:07.540
<v Speaker 2>is so big.</v>

2183
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It literally looks like a whale.</v>

2184
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:13.143
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to think that there's something out </v>

2185
01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:16.030
<v Speaker 2>there that's 10 feet bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2186
01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:19.740
<v Speaker 2>a killer whale can eat that things liver</v>
<v Speaker 2>without thinking about it in half.</v>

2187
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 2>And killer whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a dolphin.</v>

2188
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird to think that that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>has dominance over that thing.</v>

2189
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.430
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just so much smarter.</v>

2190
01:32:27.710 --> 01:32:29.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more agile,</v>

2191
01:32:29.861 --> 01:32:32.030
<v Speaker 2>so much smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For how often.</v>

2192
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a seven year old,</v>

2193
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:35.350
<v Speaker 2>what do they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2194
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shark.</v>

2195
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think isn't.</v>

2196
01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that one of the speculations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Loch ness monster was?</v>

2197
01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it was some sort of a landlocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>green or not.</v>

2198
01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:45.244
<v Speaker 2>Landlord wouldn't have been in the lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing was the lock because it </v>

2199
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:50.550
<v Speaker 2>was trapped because the law is used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be connected to.</v>

2200
01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:54.700
<v Speaker 2>That was a twig that was terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woodman,</v>

2201
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:57.100
<v Speaker 2>or it could be like a sturgeon or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>

2202
01:32:57.101 --> 01:33:02.101
<v Speaker 2>Like there was one of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those was a lake champlain or one</v>

2203
01:33:02.801 --> 01:33:05.950
<v Speaker 2>of those surgeons are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sturgeons are crazy.</v>

2204
01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 2>That's another dynamic alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gar.</v>

2205
01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:11.980
<v Speaker 2>You seen those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friends went fishing for them.</v>

2206
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't made Texas.</v>

2207
01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:16.500
<v Speaker 2>You can catch them in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things are bizarre.</v>

2208
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're noodling for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2209
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hundreds of millions of years old,</v>

2210
01:33:22.601 --> 01:33:24.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that would be.</v>

2211
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to go take my friends and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2212
01:33:26.681 --> 01:33:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Newland sometimes sounds kind of creepy </v>
<v Speaker 2>or girlfriend.</v>

2213
01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what noodling.</v>

2214
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.833
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2219
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure dudes are probably lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers.</v>

2220
01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Snapping Turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>

2221
01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.060
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Actually I googled that and the snapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>turtle incidents popped up.</v>

2223
01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:50.893
<v Speaker 2>Guys losing their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't show me this because that's like </v>

2224
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:55.783
<v Speaker 2>razors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like two razors that go garden </v>

2225
01:33:58.310 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 2>sheers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking your fucking arm off.</v>

2226
01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2227
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:06.100
<v Speaker 2>How often have you encountered workers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen an Orca.</v>

2228
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:07.001
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2229
01:34:07.001 --> 01:34:07.691
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2230
01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean not other than two worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kidnapping of them.</v>

2231
01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Foxy world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2232
01:34:12.221 --> 01:34:13.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm with Ya.</v>

2233
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2234
01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess I understand because I was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>once and I went there,</v>

2235
01:34:19.841 --> 01:34:20.674
<v Speaker 2>but I don't understand how a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical thinking adult could take their </v>

2236
01:34:26.141 --> 01:34:29.290
<v Speaker 2>kids to see world after all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that's out there about,</v>

2237
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.753
<v Speaker 2>about the social behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how smart these animals are about </v>

2238
01:34:34.751 --> 01:34:36.760
<v Speaker 2>how gotten to a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

2239
01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you if you did get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2240
01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:42.160
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

2241
01:34:42.161 --> 01:34:43.270
<v Speaker 2>well they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fed.</v>

2242
01:34:43.271 --> 01:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>They're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:46.000
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I got in this battle with and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no scientist.</v>

2245
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I debate people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm no scientist obviously.</v>

2246
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a pretty good heart and I</v>

2247
01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:56.524
<v Speaker 2>feel bad for animals that are up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that need to travel a hundred miles a </v>

2248
01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:00.074
<v Speaker 2>day in their social pacts and they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have interaction with other animals </v>

2249
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.910
<v Speaker 2>and they need a certain amount of space.</v>

2250
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:05.743
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine you think about solitary </v>

2251
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:10.460
<v Speaker 2>confinement for a prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prisoner who's,</v>

2252
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:11.323
<v Speaker 2>who's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's in a room that's no wider than </v>

2253
01:35:14.271 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 2>they are tall and maybe twice as twice </v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they are tall,</v>

2254
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2255
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.660
<v Speaker 2>and there's no interaction with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2256
01:35:20.661 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 2>They go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people will come out of prisons and</v>

2257
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:27.440
<v Speaker 2>jails worse than they went in because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thing that happens to them.</v>

2258
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.770
<v Speaker 2>But I think of being in there for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2259
01:35:30.771 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 2>just wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2260
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.890
<v Speaker 2>there's another whale and the other side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that wall.</v>

2261
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Can I get some fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2262
01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 2>you go nuts and you see these videos of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2263
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:41.110
<v Speaker 2>the trainer that was killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2264
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 2>and a trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one trainer,</v>

2265
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 2>luckily the guy was a great free diver </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he lived through a,</v>

2266
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:48.440
<v Speaker 2>basically an attack by an Orca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing he knew,</v>

2267
01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to get over to that wall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he went,</v>

2268
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna play with you and I'm just</v>

2269
01:35:52.941 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 2>going to keep pulling you down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling you down.</v>

2270
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:58.340
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was good enough freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to know,</v>

2271
01:35:58.341 --> 01:35:59.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to conserve my energy.</v>

2272
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:00.853
<v Speaker 2>I gotta bring my heart rate down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to hold my breath </v>

2273
01:36:03.171 --> 01:36:05.450
<v Speaker 2>against my will when I don't know what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>

2274
01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.020
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine used to work at marine </v>
<v Speaker 2>land in Canada.</v>

2275
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:12.170
<v Speaker 2>My friend would fill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled demars and he was an Orca trainer</v>

2276
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.273
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to get marine land </v>

2277
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:17.600
<v Speaker 2>closed down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this big lawsuit with them and</v>

2278
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:20.510
<v Speaker 2>he's been involved in a lawsuit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them for over five years now.</v>

2279
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:21.613
<v Speaker 2>I was just hanging out with him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto and he was a Walrus trainer and </v>

2280
01:36:25.851 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 2>this is Walrus that he was taken care </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

2281
01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 2>It's the only one that's left there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>survived.</v>

2282
01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.720
<v Speaker 2>And marine land is like slowly going </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankrupt.</v>

2283
01:36:32.721 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 2>The guy who was the original owner is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now quickly go bankrupt.</v>

2284
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:38.030
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2285
01:36:38.031 --> 01:36:40.790
<v Speaker 2>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole business is so dark because,</v>

2286
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:42.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them say,</v>

2287
01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.060
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't take any,</v>

2288
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orcas are dolphins from captivity,</v>

2289
01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:50.690
<v Speaker 2>but they'll get them from people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stole them in the wild and they,</v>

2290
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2291
01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.640
<v Speaker 2>breed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2292
01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I think there's no more breeding a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

2293
01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they'll get them from someone that </v>

2294
01:36:56.091 --> 01:36:59.590
<v Speaker 2>bred them in Canada or Russia or China </v>
<v Speaker 2>or wherever,</v>

2295
01:36:59.630 --> 01:37:01.670
<v Speaker 2>someplace where there's not as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

2296
01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:02.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Lilly,</v>

2297
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 2>who was the guy who actually invented </v>
<v Speaker 2>the isolation tank,</v>

2298
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.883
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a pioneer in interspecies </v>

2299
01:37:08.121 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 2>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

2300
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:12.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a scientist.</v>

2301
01:37:12.771 --> 01:37:13.604
<v Speaker 2>That was also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took like extreme liberties with his </v>

2302
01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.400
<v Speaker 2>scientific research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a lot of acid,</v>

2303
01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:20.234
<v Speaker 2>gave asset to dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a lot of dolphin research in the </v>

2304
01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 2>flotation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a lot of really,</v>

2305
01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:26.750
<v Speaker 2>really wacky shit.</v>

2306
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:27.583
<v Speaker 2>But he believed that one day dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna have a seat in the United </v>

2307
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:32.383
<v Speaker 2>Nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes we're going to be able to </v>

2308
01:37:32.571 --> 01:37:33.404
<v Speaker 2>communicate with dolphins and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins were going to be recognized as </v>

2309
01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.693
<v Speaker 2>water people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought they were going to be </v>

2310
01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 2>literally the thought there was smartest</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

2311
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:42.224
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could figure out how to </v>

2312
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:45.860
<v Speaker 2>communicate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have the same rights as human</v>

2313
01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:47.510
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2314
01:37:47.511 --> 01:37:49.630
<v Speaker 2>And Guy was a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2315
01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:52.580
<v Speaker 2>just he and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with them.</v>

2316
01:37:52.581 --> 01:37:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

2317
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 2>There's a way that they have of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating that we don't understand,</v>

2318
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's super complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very of their own dialects.</v>

2319
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:02.803
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2320
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:06.090
<v Speaker 2>they have this crazy social code that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean they,</v>

2321
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:07.223
<v Speaker 2>they have something like incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic about their environment and </v>

2322
01:38:10.501 --> 01:38:11.334
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2323
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:12.190
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2324
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their social groups.</v>

2325
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 2>To be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2326
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.760
<v Speaker 2>to be able to speak a language you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know,</v>

2327
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 2>like 150 words.</v>

2328
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:21.730
<v Speaker 2>There was a dolphin that new like 700 </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

2329
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.910
<v Speaker 2>300 words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2330
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.420
<v Speaker 2>like 100 commands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standard human words.</v>

2331
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:28.100
<v Speaker 2>You know how many dolphin words we know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

2332
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.900
<v Speaker 2>A fucking clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>

2333
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:33.990
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2334
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:38.991
<v Speaker 2>but they're so goddamn stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking stop giving me macro level.</v>

2335
01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:41.140
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know,</v>

2336
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:41.993
<v Speaker 2>were making fun of them for 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they know what to do with </v>

2337
01:38:44.311 --> 01:38:45.144
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2338
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:48.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Phil was working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with was there's a group,</v>

2339
01:38:48.421 --> 01:38:50.610
<v Speaker 2>what was that group that where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

2340
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:51.623
<v Speaker 2>they're going to create a boundary out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ocean and slowly released these </v>

2341
01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:59.690
<v Speaker 2>dolphins and orcas out into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundary and then you know,</v>

2342
01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:00.533
<v Speaker 2>and keep feeding them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then slowly released them out open </v>

2343
01:39:03.301 --> 01:39:04.290
<v Speaker 2>ocean pens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:06.360
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about doing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly,</v>

2345
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.613
<v Speaker 2>and that would be a way for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually experience it because the idea </v>

2346
01:39:10.441 --> 01:39:13.830
<v Speaker 2>is that you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a debate with his trainer.</v>

2347
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.120
<v Speaker 2>I watched blackfish and it just freaked </v>
<v Speaker 2>me out and of course it's.</v>

2348
01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.190
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a lot of confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 2>bias.</v>

2349
01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:23.820
<v Speaker 2>There's probably some information in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that is not totally unbiased.</v>

2350
01:39:23.821 --> 01:39:24.654
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they're trying to make a </v>

2351
01:39:25.321 --> 01:39:26.970
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this woman was.</v>

2352
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.610
<v Speaker 2>She talked to all the different trainers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

2353
01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.313
<v Speaker 2>I got in contact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy got in contact with me that was a </v>

2354
01:39:32.641 --> 01:39:34.260
<v Speaker 2>trainer and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>

2355
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 2>the whole movie is Bs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2356
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I believe this guy was actually in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

2357
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:40.230
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all bs.</v>

2358
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Orcas live longer in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in captivity in indeed they do.</v>

2359
01:39:44.401 --> 01:39:45.234
<v Speaker 2>In the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me that orcas haven't been in </v>

2360
01:39:48.421 --> 01:39:51.120
<v Speaker 2>captivity as long as they live yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't know that.</v>

2361
01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.100
<v Speaker 2>So that's completely a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2362
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:56.910
<v Speaker 2>He has no idea if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said they're more healthy.</v>

2363
01:39:56.911 --> 01:39:58.980
<v Speaker 2>He told me all these things and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally went,</v>

2364
01:39:58.981 --> 01:40:00.150
<v Speaker 2>this guy's just full of shit.</v>

2365
01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2366
01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't buy what he's telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He.</v>

2367
01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:06.180
<v Speaker 2>But he said I'm a trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been a trainer for it.</v>

2368
01:40:06.370 --> 01:40:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I looked him up and biased because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes his living exactly.</v>

2369
01:40:09.481 --> 01:40:13.010
<v Speaker 2>And I know some dolphin trainers and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually went to seaworld a few times in</v>

2370
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.863
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to know a few of the trainers </v>

2371
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:15.684
<v Speaker 2>back in the late nineties and I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>there a few times when I'm with the </v>

2372
01:40:16.921 --> 01:40:18.750
<v Speaker 2>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first day I was there,</v>

2373
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.740
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I asked him was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they?</v>

2374
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Well these guys ever get set free and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2375
01:40:23.581 --> 01:40:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Then I could feel a little pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2376
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 2>like straight away I could feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2377
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.820
<v Speaker 2>and I released my slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:30.654
<v Speaker 2>I felt a little uncomfortable with keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking questions because it is their </v>

2379
01:40:32.551 --> 01:40:33.384
<v Speaker 2>livelihood and I had a respect for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that all these trainers love </v>

2380
01:40:36.121 --> 01:40:37.230
<v Speaker 2>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really,</v>

2381
01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:38.064
<v Speaker 2>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably loved them more than most </v>

2382
01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:40.540
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2383
01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.510
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't make it right at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2384
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:45.503
<v Speaker 2>and there are probably some animals that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can handle being in a zoo or they're </v>

2385
01:40:47.851 --> 01:40:49.190
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're giraffes,</v>

2386
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:50.820
<v Speaker 2>giraffes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bit about that,</v>

2387
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>that just walking around going on was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>lions,</v>

2388
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:54.851
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2389
01:40:54.851 --> 01:40:55.684
<v Speaker 1>they get fed well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really need to migrate </v>

2390
01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Predator that's going after them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2391
01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean they let babies feed giraffes at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the zoo.</v>

2392
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's so calm.</v>

2393
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.190
<v Speaker 1>My friend has a draft in Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2394

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2414
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:53.103
<v Speaker 1>he came home one day or one night a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion got into his pig pen or </v>

2415
01:41:58.770 --> 01:42:03.640
<v Speaker 1>pen or something Kinda ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them were talking about</v>

2416
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:07.020
<v Speaker 1>that anymore and it had to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he had this,</v>

2417
01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:07.873
<v Speaker 1>the way he had his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't climb up the fencing or </v>

2418
01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:14.020
<v Speaker 1>break under it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had tried apparently the thing new to</v>

2419
01:42:14.021 --> 01:42:19.000
<v Speaker 1>climb up this tree and drop from like 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet or 15 feet down into the pin.</v>

2420
01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2421
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to climb this tree he had.</v>

2422
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 1>He has cameras and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He figured it out.</v>

2423
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.193
<v Speaker 1>Figured it out.</v>

2424
01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck those things man.</v>

2425
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:30.403
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to muscle bay and in South </v>

2426
01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:33.633
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was interested to do one of those </v>

2427
01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 1>shark dive feeding tours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'll go check it out.</v>

2428
01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Got there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the boat and you go out and you </v>

2429
01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:41.404
<v Speaker 1>don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to bring my own wetsuit </v>

2430
01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:43.840
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want all this fish </v>
<v Speaker 1>slime all over it.</v>

2431
01:42:43.841 --> 01:42:44.674
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't want to go back to </v>

2432
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.100
<v Speaker 1>surfing the next day at some back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffery's bay.</v>

2433
01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Smelled like fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

2435
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:56.110
<v Speaker 1>get on the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out there and where they feed them,</v>

2436
01:42:56.111 --> 01:42:58.990
<v Speaker 1>there's like these couple of little rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>islands that stick up right there.</v>

2437
01:42:58.991 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And they'd just parked the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they parked the boat,</v>

2438
01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.170
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sharks are on you.</v>

2439
01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:03.513
<v Speaker 1>Sharks are pretty inquisitive anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I've been on boats out in the </v>

2440
01:43:06.641 --> 01:43:07.840
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing or diving,</v>

2441
01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.060
<v Speaker 1>wasn't Papa New Guinea one time.</v>

2442
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:10.893
<v Speaker 1>We pulled up everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We anchored immediately be three to </v>

2443
01:43:12.881 --> 01:43:14.830
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more sharks on the boat.</v>

2444
01:43:14.831 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you come up from the deep check out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2445
01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:17.893
<v Speaker 1>And to kind of disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're probably watching because </v>

2446
01:43:19.901 --> 01:43:20.920
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what's going on.</v>

2447
01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.473
<v Speaker 1>But the great whites pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that day we saw about eight or </v>

2448
01:43:25.421 --> 01:43:28.420
<v Speaker 1>10 great whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sizes and ages and whatever.</v>

2449
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about 500 yards away?</v>

2450
01:43:31.361 --> 01:43:35.590
<v Speaker 1>There were guys surfing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking weird man.</v>

2451
01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way I'd be surfing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys surf there every day.</v>

2452
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a couple other spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of friends of mine like grew up</v>

2453
01:43:42.371 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 1>in that area and they surf these reefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are like right back where we came a</v>

2454
01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:49.570
<v Speaker 1>mile a mile from there and the boat just</v>
<v Speaker 1>on just on the outside of this harbor.</v>

2455
01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:51.453
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2456
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:53.713
<v Speaker 2>there's kind kinda two ways of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like number one thing that bothers me </v>

2457
01:43:57.081 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 2>with it is that dish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sharks know where they got,</v>

2458
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:01.550
<v Speaker 2>they got a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks,</v>

2459
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:03.403
<v Speaker 2>they tagged sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know they come back to a hunting </v>

2460
01:44:04.821 --> 01:44:05.654
<v Speaker 2>place where they got a seal the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>before or whatever and they're there at </v>

2461
01:44:08.211 --> 01:44:09.290
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2462
01:44:09.291 --> 01:44:10.820
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the same month or whatever.</v>

2463
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>So like September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>October,</v>

2464
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:16.460
<v Speaker 2>they're like here on the coast of </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

2465
01:44:16.461 --> 01:44:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Internal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2466
01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And then they go down to Guadalupe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Island and then then they go out about a</v>

2467
01:44:21.150 --> 01:44:21.983
<v Speaker 2>thousand miles off the coast and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe they breed out there and then a </v>

2468
01:44:24.021 --> 01:44:24.854
<v Speaker 2>lot of the females will go to Hawaii in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the males that come back and kind of do </v>

2469
01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:28.610
<v Speaker 2>that route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up the coast.</v>

2470
01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.560
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2471
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.440
<v Speaker 2>The craziest thing about these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2472
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:33.303
<v Speaker 2>they know how to just free swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if I'm swimming on the </v>

2473
01:44:37.911 --> 01:44:39.740
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to like put my head up and go,</v>

2474
01:44:39.741 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the beach?</v>

2475
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know which direction I'm going.</v>

2476
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:43.123
<v Speaker 2>Imagine like they can just swim out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean and find each other thousand </v>

2477
01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:49.160
<v Speaker 2>miles from shore and breed out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of nowhere.</v>

2478
01:44:49.161 --> 01:44:51.250
<v Speaker 2>How do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they do that and they all know to</v>

2479
01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:56.260
<v Speaker 2>get to this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine like fish smell.</v>

2480
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how bad shark pussy smells like </v>
<v Speaker 2>real distinct.</v>

2481
01:45:01.530 --> 01:45:02.363
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean animals have crazy smells each </v>

2482
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:06.404
<v Speaker 2>other when they're breeding in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon knows that there's a liver in </v>

2483
01:45:08.481 --> 01:45:09.314
<v Speaker 2>that great white and he's gonna smash it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eat the liver out of that and leave </v>

2484
01:45:12.381 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 2>the shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they smell that.</v>

2485
01:45:15.090 --> 01:45:18.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what all Alpha males like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>packs,</v>

2486
01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 2>when they kill a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha male always eats to deliver.</v>

2487
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most nutrient dense Oregon.</v>

2488
01:45:24.711 --> 01:45:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the.</v>

2489
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.630
<v Speaker 2>So what I don't like is that sharks I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe are equating,</v>

2490
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:30.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a boat,</v>

2491
01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I see a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that thing is,</v>

2492
01:45:33.081 --> 01:45:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and he's got food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2493
01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like that equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2494
01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 2>it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all these shark week's and stuff,</v>

2495
01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.500
<v Speaker 2>they're all filming off of Cape Town and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2496
01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:43.493
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

2497
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I think they're educating the sharks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2498
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:47.210
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

2499
01:45:47.211 --> 01:45:48.044
<v Speaker 2>it's not fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not necessarily the person's </v>

2500
01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:51.224
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have food and if they don't </v>

2501
01:45:51.831 --> 01:45:52.664
<v Speaker 2>give it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a spear fisherman shooting a </v>

2502
01:45:53.471 --> 01:45:54.560
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't give up.</v>

2503
01:45:54.561 --> 01:45:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Your fish will bite you sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2504
01:45:56.331 --> 01:45:57.164
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case in Kodiak Island with </v>

2505
01:45:58.491 --> 01:45:59.324
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said the grizzly bears have gotten </v>

2506
01:46:01.011 --> 01:46:05.030
<v Speaker 2>so used to the sound of a gunshot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning a deer's dead.</v>

2507
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.923

<v Speaker 2>So they hear a gunshot.</v>

2510
01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 2>If someone shot a moose or someone shot </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2513
01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:22.670
<v Speaker 2>there's an island up in the Aleutians </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has a bunch of Caribou on it.</v>

2522
01:46:40.011 --> 01:46:40.844
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they took some meal eating that </v>

2523
01:46:43.401 --> 01:46:45.260
<v Speaker 2>thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will the bear buried it?</v>

2524
01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Buried it buried a jog and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic?</v>

2525
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an enormous bear.</v>

2526
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a bear in the Yukon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you talked about and bear.</v>

2527
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

2528
01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:57.990
<v Speaker 2>11 foot bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this bear buried his entire moves and</v>

2529
01:46:57.991 --> 01:47:00.470
<v Speaker 2>it's all fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moves.</v>

2530
01:47:00.471 --> 01:47:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Like an 1800 try moving that moose one </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>

2531
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This bay or just picked it up and dug </v>

2532
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2533
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:11.600
<v Speaker 2>like a front loader or one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>cranes just digs foundations for houses.</v>

2534
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:12.743
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the meat to rotten and they grind </v>

2535
01:47:14.341 --> 01:47:15.174
<v Speaker 2>it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also want to cover it so the birds </v>

2536
01:47:16.711 --> 01:47:18.840
<v Speaker 2>don't find it and then nothing else can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>

2537
01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 2>So they did giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll cover the Moose and the Gi.</v>

2538
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 2>He just decided it was his and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were terrified.</v>

2539
01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:29.280
<v Speaker 2>When they got there they found the Moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>was covered.</v>

2540
01:47:29.281 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 2>They knew it was a grizzly that did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was so big.</v>

2541
01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.850
<v Speaker 2>So they just took some of the meat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran pleasure.</v>

2542
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.693
<v Speaker 2>So primal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can only do so much at a </v>

2543
01:47:37.471 --> 01:47:38.940
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why would you even take any?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's already 6:30.</v>

2594
01:49:59.050 --> 01:49:59.883
<v Speaker 2>I had a question for you please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this with a couple </v>

2595
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:03.154
<v Speaker 2>of friends of mine that you are exposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to probably more information and people </v>

2596
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:12.100
<v Speaker 2>and and all that and more walks of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>than maybe anybody in the world.</v>

2597
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:13.243
<v Speaker 2>You realize that everything about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you get such a diverse group of </v>

2598
01:50:17.231 --> 01:50:18.064
<v Speaker 2>people to come talk to you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians to chemists and scientists </v>

2599
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:25.720
<v Speaker 2>and athletes and you just know so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>information about so many topics.</v>

2600
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really no light scattering.</v>

2601
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Little for you know a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2602
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:31.303
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I don't remember anyone being </v>

2603
01:50:34.001 --> 01:50:34.834
<v Speaker 2>humble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I think it's cool because </v>

2604
01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 2>you're just in this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

2605
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.633
<v Speaker 2>you're in this place where now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information is so readily available to </v>

2606
01:50:42.951 --> 01:50:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you firsthand and definitely have </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot,</v>

2607
01:50:45.551 --> 01:50:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but what's interesting is that this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>never the plan.</v>

2608
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:52.300
<v Speaker 2>This is all just complete happenstance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and good fortune.</v>

2609
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this whole thing just </v>
<v Speaker 2>started out talking shit with comedian </v>

<v Speaker 2>that are trying to compete you at me.</v>

2749
01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:19.013
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to regret getting into this </v>

2750
01:56:20.821 --> 01:56:21.654
<v Speaker 2>competition with me because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they totally understood how </v>

2751
01:56:23.581 --> 01:56:26.550
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this thing started heating up and</v>

2752
01:56:26.551 --> 01:56:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I told them I'm going to do 929 points </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>

2753
01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,600</v>

2754
01:56:32.161 --> 01:56:35.490
<v Speaker 2>points ahead of second place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever fast.</v>

2755
01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you fasted fuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2756
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2757
01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I've done intermittent fasting fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 16 hours but never liked the master</v>

2758
01:56:41.731 --> 01:56:43.460
<v Speaker 2>cleanse for 10 days or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2759
01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I like food too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do enjoy intermittent fasting.</v>

2760
01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I like to do 16 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done like nine,</v>

2761
01:56:50.131 --> 01:56:51.750
<v Speaker 2>10 day fasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Master cleanse,</v>

2762
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:53.363
<v Speaker 2>but do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recommend it just because you get all </v>

2763
01:56:56.251 --> 01:56:58.650
<v Speaker 2>this stuff out of your colon that looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your colon.</v>

2764
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like old poop and it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

2765
01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I came out of my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I pooped out my colon.</v>

2766
01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:09.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's like when you haven't eaten in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like two days now,</v>

2767
01:57:09.650 --> 01:57:10.483
<v Speaker 2>how much you shitting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still know that y'all used to poop </v>

2768
01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 2>the poop everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

2769
01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2770
01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:15.710
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to.</v>

2771
01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:18.270
<v Speaker 2>This stuff comes out of your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call mucoid plaque.</v>

2772
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:21.120
<v Speaker 2>You can google that and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like 20,</v>

2773
01:57:21.121 --> 01:57:21.954
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years of stuff built up from the </v>

2774
01:57:23.131 --> 01:57:23.964
<v Speaker 2>mucus your body creates when it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what you're eating and that goes </v>

2775
01:57:27.121 --> 01:57:30.750
<v Speaker 2>down and it gets stuck on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the walls of your intestines and it's</v>

2776
01:57:30.751 --> 01:57:31.584
<v Speaker 2>like tire rubber and you poop it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly like the shape of your </v>

2777
01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:37.100
<v Speaker 2>intestine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was my intestines.</v>

2778
01:57:37.101 --> 01:57:38.580
<v Speaker 2>So you thought you should out part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

2779
01:57:38.610 --> 01:57:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was freaky.</v>

2780
01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.880
<v Speaker 2>And how how good you feel and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

2781
01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.650
<v Speaker 2>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>latency,</v>

2782
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 2>pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull it up.</v>

2783
01:57:48.690 --> 01:57:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't believe it was real and I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's like weird flap.</v>

2784
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 2>That is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:57:54.511 --> 01:57:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I got something that does look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>intestine.</v>

2786
01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like intestine dude.</v>

2787
01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:00.383
<v Speaker 2>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what comes after your </v>

2788
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:05.570
<v Speaker 2>nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have to go through that to get Kiddo.</v>

2789
01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.593
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe I'll do that right after I'm </v>

2790
01:58:07.501 --> 01:58:10.970
<v Speaker 2>done with sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Google the master class,</v>

2791
01:58:11.010 --> 01:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>because you're drinking a tea of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>maple syrup,</v>

2792
01:58:13.381 --> 01:58:15.150
<v Speaker 2>lemon and Cayenne pepper for how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times?</v>

2793
01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it for 10 days.</v>

2794
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Ten days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No food.</v>

2795
01:58:18.571 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2796
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:20.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got that stuff coming out after </v>

2797
01:58:22.861 --> 01:58:24.960
<v Speaker 2>about five days because I was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive with the.</v>

2798
01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.353
<v Speaker 2>You do a salt water flush every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every morning and then you take this </v>

2799
01:58:29.611 --> 01:58:32.460
<v Speaker 2>smooth move tea that makes you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like go to the bathroom.</v>

2800
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:33.623
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one thing that I had been </v>

2801
01:58:34.351 --> 01:58:36.180
<v Speaker 2>doing because I've been sweating so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2802
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I videotaped one day the sweat puddles </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are left in the jar.</v>

2803
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I watched that and then I set off my </v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm fire alarm in my gym from my sweat</v>

2804
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:47.373
<v Speaker 2>and today it was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when you lapped the field of </v>

2805
01:58:49.631 --> 01:58:50.610
<v Speaker 2>your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2806
01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Today was so bad too because today I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longest that I've ever worked out,</v>

2807
01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.240
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know your nutrition is good too,</v>

2808
01:58:58.241 --> 01:58:59.074
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta be thinking about what's </v>

2809
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:01.570
<v Speaker 2>going out in what you got to put back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2810
01:59:01.610 --> 01:59:06.610
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking water with electrolytes and I'm</v>

2811
01:59:06.701 --> 01:59:11.701
<v Speaker 2>adding salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm adding Himalayan salt to the water,</v>

2812
01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.920
<v Speaker 2>but I may be added too much and when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about just forget diarrhea,</v>

2813
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:19.123
<v Speaker 2>not really diarrhea kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically water coming out of my </v>

2814
01:59:23.411 --> 01:59:26.290
<v Speaker 2>ass because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be like,</v>

2815
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I would feel it be like you don't pay it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2816
01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:29.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like opening flood gates and </v>

2817
01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water would come out of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

2818
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Most people should do that like once or </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice a month.</v>

2819
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:36.964
<v Speaker 2>Two tables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two teaspoons of salt in one liter of </v>

2820
01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:41.060
<v Speaker 2>water or a quarter water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banging it.</v>

2821
01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Your body sees it as food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as P,</v>

2822
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:44.223
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means you have to stay home for </v>

2823
01:59:46.931 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't staying home.</v>

2824
01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I would just jump off the treadmill for </v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes.</v>

2825
01:59:50.441 --> 01:59:51.274
<v Speaker 2>Take a volume is shit of water was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically water coming out of my </v>

2826
01:59:54.581 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 2>asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it probably cleans up a lot.</v>

2827
01:59:57.191 --> 01:59:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cleans.</v>

2828
01:59:58.690 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 2>It cleans you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2829
01:59:59.610 --> 02:00:01.900
<v Speaker 2>There was stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird stuff floating around in there.</v>

2830
02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:02.763
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe body uses so much energy for </v>

2831
02:00:04.541 --> 02:00:05.650
<v Speaker 2>digestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2832
02:00:05.710 --> 02:00:08.260
<v Speaker 2>but I got these guys that fall in line </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do water fast,</v>

2833
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:12.220
<v Speaker 2>like every month and they're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>five to 10 day water fast coming up this</v>

2834
02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:12.940
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

2835
02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to participate in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2836
02:00:15.071 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 2>but I want to do a fast soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2837
02:00:16.931 --> 02:00:17.764
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much did you look forward to that </v>

2838
02:00:19.061 --> 02:00:20.700
<v Speaker 2>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tea with the law?</v>

2839
02:00:20.770 --> 02:00:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed calories.</v>

2840
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really enjoyed it.</v>

2841
02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost.</v>

2842
02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't weigh myself,</v>

2843
02:00:26.651 --> 02:00:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but I think I lost 10 to 12 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

2844
02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty sure I did,</v>

2845
02:00:33.371 --> 02:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>but I was thin too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2846
02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>But then you build back at that first </v>
<v Speaker 2>date I ate afterwards,</v>

2847
02:00:39.021 --> 02:00:39.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like the best food I ever had my </v>

2848
02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:42.560
<v Speaker 2>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2849
02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.090
<v Speaker 2>just like you've never deep 10 whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>days of just the tea.</v>

2850
02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2851
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.940
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2852
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:51.400
<v Speaker 2>and a salt water flush every day and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>smooth move tea,</v>

2853
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:52.960
<v Speaker 2>which I was doubling up on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

2854
02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:55.840
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't have the full 14 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like I got to go fast.</v>

2855
02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>But I was getting stomach cramps because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was eating,</v>

2856
02:00:57.850 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 2>drinking too much of that tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try that.</v>

2857
02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give that a shot.</v>

2858
02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:02.590
<v Speaker 2>At least Google it and look and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2859
02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.170
<v Speaker 2>but when you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can abstain from food,</v>

2860
02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.033
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you could quit heroin or some </v>

2861
02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:12.850
<v Speaker 2>people are so addicted to food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at people thing because of this.</v>

2862
02:01:12.851 --> 02:01:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm the amount of calories that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming.</v>

2863
02:01:15.761 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Like let me tell you how much I burned </v>
<v Speaker 2>today because it's so goddamn insane.</v>

2864
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Today I burned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this doesn't even,</v>

2865
02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:27.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I burned 4,217</v>

2866
02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:30.210
<v Speaker 2>calories during this workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2867
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a or you just circuiting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time,</v>

2868
02:01:33.810 --> 02:01:37.360
<v Speaker 2>ran the hills around two miles with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog in the hills,</v>

2869
02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 2>which believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get many fucking points for it</v>

2870
02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:41.264
<v Speaker 2>because it's think sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way harder than the other things </v>

2871
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>that I'm doing because it's basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up,</v>

2872
02:01:45.051 --> 02:01:45.884
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just trying to.</v>

2873
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I have a two year old golden retriever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got so much goddamn energy.</v>

2874
02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:54.110
<v Speaker 2>He's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to wear his ass out.</v>

2875
02:01:54.111 --> 02:01:54.944
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise he annoys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody jumps up on people who just </v>

2876
02:01:56.811 --> 02:01:57.644
<v Speaker 2>needs attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I run with them he's just </v>

2877
02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll do two miles in the.</v>
