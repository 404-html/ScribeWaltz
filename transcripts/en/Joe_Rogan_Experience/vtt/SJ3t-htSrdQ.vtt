12
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Ben O'brien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an awesome dude.</v>

13
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And apparently you guys had a great time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New Zealand.</v>

14
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very Texas.</v>

16
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>We had a really good old time down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

18
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been to New Zealand for</v>

19
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>hunting before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been there for surfing,</v>

20
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>so it was really cool to go and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the country and do</v>

21
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>some hunting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did some back country stuff surfing</v>

22
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it as dangerous as surfing in</v>

23
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Australia?</v>

24
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>As far as like sharks a?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

25
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>not as dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say.</v>

26
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

27
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>there are sharks there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty close to Australia.</v>

28
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like a one hour flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

29
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was thinking sharks here</v>
<v Speaker 1>or over there,</v>

30
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:52.411
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

31
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think of sharks as as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

32
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a yellow,</v>

33
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>a total radical fear of sharks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary,</v>

34
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>scary creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm fucking horrified.</v>

35
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>How close have you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be.</v>

36
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close.</v>

37
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got bumped off my board when I was a</v>

38
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

39
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Surfing into a place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sort of near my house,</v>

40
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>but the water was that the sand was</v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

41
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can really see the is actually</v>

42
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Sam is black,</v>

43
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>so it bumped me and I never really got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what it was.</v>

44
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>But I'm pretty sure it was a shark and</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

45
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of sharks in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of sharks,</v>

46
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>wherever the waves are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's a lot of sharks,</v>

47
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>That's not a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

49
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.761
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

50
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>They're just everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy.</v>

51
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>As you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny about sharks.</v>

52
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>As I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

53
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>the only real sharks I had to worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about where,</v>

55
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great whites and you know,</v>

56
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I was born and raised in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assess where I grew up surfing and um,</v>

57
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought like great white</v>

58
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always in really cool places.</v>

59
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have to worry it around</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and they've been finding a ton of</v>

60
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>great white sharks around where I live</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

61
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>They're all over Hawaii now and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great white sharks are actually warm</v>

62
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>blooded so they can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can totally adjust their,</v>

63
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.903
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess their body temperature</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to,</v>

65
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>to totally survive and thrive in warm</v>
<v Speaker 1>water as well as cold.</v>

66
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>So they just go wherever the hell they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

67
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

68
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I turn on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local news.</v>

69
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Some dude got bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

70
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often does it happen?</v>

71
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of sharks.</v>

72
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's funny is it never used to happen</v>

73
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even really a thought for me.</v>

74
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scared of sharks and all that</v>

75
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people didn't really get start</v>

76
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>getting chomped until I was a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>older in the last,</v>

77
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>in the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been tons and tons of shark</v>

78
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>attacks in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend,</v>

79
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine and Bethany Hamilton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a really,</v>

80
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>really talented surfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got bit.</v>

81
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>She had her arm chomped right off her</v>
<v Speaker 1>body for a young girl.</v>

82
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And Hawaii surfing perfect waves out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their friend and shark came up and</v>

84
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.840
<v Speaker 1>just ripped her arm right now for body</v>
<v Speaker 1>gangsters.</v>

85
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she just gets right back on the</v>

86
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>board and she survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's bad ass.</v>

87
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.670
<v Speaker 1>She's super bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

88
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>she actually served some of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>waves,</v>

89
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all year.</v>

90
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Last year she got towed into a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Jaws on Maui and surfing 50 foot</v>

91
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>waves with one arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting pounded by giant waves and she,</v>

93
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>she paddles into some huge ways with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

94
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And gets held under water with one arm</v>

95
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and magic magically held under from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant wave underwater,</v>

96
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to,</v>

97
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

98
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people who are terrified of</v>

99
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 1>surfing big waves with two arms and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

100
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>they're under water wanting a breath and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's under there with one arm.</v>

101
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine having like your arm tied to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your side and having to try and swim to</v>

102
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>the surface the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty scary.</v>

103
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Now when you get hit by a big wave like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you get sucked under,</v>

104
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 1>how long are you under normally for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

105
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>usually a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty short amount of time.</v>

106
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>But it really varies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

107
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

108
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing about surfing really big</v>

109
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>waves and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had a lot of people die surfing</v>

110
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.850
<v Speaker 1>big waves and it is super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the thing that kills people is getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>held under for two waves.</v>

112
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you fall on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you take off on a wave and</v>

113
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>you fall and you're underwater for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>super long time.</v>

114
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And this has happened to me a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different times.</v>

115
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>You're underwater really far and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>

116
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wave hold you under and it's rolling</v>

117
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>you along the reef towards the shore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're underwater near the bottom or at</v>

118
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and then the waves just</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to dissipate and lose a little</v>

119
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>bit of power and he can finally start</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming up and then the next wave is</v>

120
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile it's on its way and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming up,</v>

121
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>swimming up and the waves coming at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get a breath in.</v>

122
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>The wave takes you straight back down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

123
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's how people die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>it's scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long have you been held under?</v>

125
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:49.261
<v Speaker 1>For about a minute and 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time.</v>

126
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.990
<v Speaker 1>The only reason I know that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

127
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I had a terrible wipe out at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a big wave place in northern</v>

128
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>California called Mavericks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my first trip ever there and I</v>

129
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>was having this awesome trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

130
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the best big waves in the</v>

131
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to go there,</v>

132
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>but I was pretty scared of it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up going there and having a.</v>

133
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>The first day I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was super good.</v>

134
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a blast.</v>

135
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fall once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to just it with like a dream</v>

136
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cuddle these big waves.</v>

137
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Thought I was killing it next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just absolutely smashed me.</v>

138
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I took it off on a wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ate shit down the face,</v>

139
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>got sucked over the falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>held under forever on the reef and was</v>

140
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>swimming towards the surface and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day it was like a 50 foot face</v>

141
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>broke right on top of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoved me straight back down to the</v>

142
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>reef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

143
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>as I was swimming up to try and get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath,</v>

144
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I was doing those involuntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>when you're going like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

146
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get a breath now.</v>

147
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom.</v>

148
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

149
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>it was really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the scariest,</v>

150
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>scariest time of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

151
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.914
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

152
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile,</v>

153
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile there was a woman on a boat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was filming the whole ordeal.</v>

154
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>My board was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it tomb stoning where you can</v>

155
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 1>only see half your board and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

156
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and there's a leash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

157
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>And you're connected to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a was like this,</v>

158
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only see half the half the board</v>

159
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>for the next wave passed me by and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>board was still like that for over a</v>

160
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>minute and I was like a minute and 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds at a way,</v>

161
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.253
<v Speaker 1>way too long.</v>

162
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

163
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to hold your breath for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

164
00:06:14.381 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Just doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.020
<v Speaker 2>It is holding your breath for a minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're struggling.</v>

166
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And also your adrenaline's kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're freaking out.</v>

167
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're realizing that you got to get</v>

168
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:27.844
<v Speaker 2>some air soon.</v>

169
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing is,</v>

172
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.461
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:36.070
<v Speaker 1>learning about breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the whole thing that speeds up</v>

174
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

175
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.261
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your breath.</v>

176
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Hold is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

177
00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:42.850
<v Speaker 1>or I should say shortening your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold is panicking.</v>

178
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.173
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you,</v>

179
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay calm and know that you're going to</v>

180
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't use up your breath very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fast,</v>

182
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you start to panic it's like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flooring the gas and it just speeds</v>

183
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:56.340
<v Speaker 1>up the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

184
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>so panicking is lasting that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

185
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but when you're really terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens to everybody.</v>

186
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a big connection between Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>and surfing.</v>

187
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that I know that Love</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu also love surfing and they do it</v>

188
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

189
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.320
<v Speaker 2>that breath thing is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes into play in both situations</v>

190
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 2>because if you're in a bad position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if someone's choking you or</v>

191
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:23.310
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can relax and stay calm and kind of</v>

192
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.420
<v Speaker 2>barely get out of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you freak out and you start,</v>

193
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.720
<v Speaker 2>you start hyperventilating or panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

194
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.940
<v Speaker 2>you just have to tap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run out of gas,</v>

195
00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 2>you run out of air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the choke sinks in deeper in.</v>

196
00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Some people are just really good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfing and for some reason that like</v>

197
00:07:40.531 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Hicks and Gracie is a famous example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really good at Yoga,</v>

198
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.080
<v Speaker 2>which is also really big for controlling</v>
<v Speaker 2>your breath and staying calm and</v>

199
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 2>regulating your heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's also obviously a master at</v>

200
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he loves surfing and I think in some</v>

201
00:07:57.541 --> 00:08:01.440
<v Speaker 2>way those things are kind of connected</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to sort of maintain some</v>

202
00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 2>sort of control over your physical body.</v>

203
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

204
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

205
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:09.390
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing how long you can hold your</v>

207
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:12.300
<v Speaker 1>breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm especially under pressure,</v>

208
00:08:12.301 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>especially with a high heart rate is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>key.</v>

209
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

210
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a breath holding course.</v>

211
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.540
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually a specifically tailored</v>

212
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 1>to surviving big waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

213
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 1>this course I did was four days long and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first couple of days they just,</v>

214
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they just kind of taught us with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>science behind breath,</v>

215
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get your breath,</v>

216
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:33.030
<v Speaker 1>hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they basically,</v>

217
00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked our way up to our highest static</v>

218
00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:39.900
<v Speaker 1>hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from there we had to hold our</v>

219
00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:42.690
<v Speaker 1>breath for a quarter of that time under</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>

220
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you take a breath hold course,</v>

221
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 2>like what are they teaching?</v>

222
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the science behind the how,</v>

223
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.730
<v Speaker 1>how some people can hold their breath</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and some people can't.</v>

224
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference,</v>

225
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

226
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically psychological.</v>

227
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It's all in your mind really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

228
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

229
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>if you think you can hold your breath</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like if right now you tried to hold</v>

230
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>your breath for and you could only make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a minute for sure.</v>

231
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>You can hold your breath for 300</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

232
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 1>It's all in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you believe that you are going</v>

233
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>to be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

234
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body tells you that you need to</v>

235
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.200
<v Speaker 1>breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

236
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Kinda for that course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the first day I tried to hold my</v>

237
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and I'm in relatively good shape and</v>

238
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I never ever practice holding my breath</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

239
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good lung capacity because I was</v>

240
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>training all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at that time,</v>

241
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the longest I could hold my breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That first day was like two minutes and</v>

242
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by date,</v>

243
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was holding it for five minutes and 34</v>

244
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:39.590
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

245
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

246
00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:44.510
<v Speaker 3>So it's just techniques and understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technique.</v>

247
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Speaker 3>What is the world record wasn't a w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the fucking magician guy?</v>

248
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he break the world record like 17</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes or something like that.</v>

249
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.940
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some weird where it sucked in pure</v>

250
00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:59.000
<v Speaker 3>oxygen or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheating bullshit is night and day.</v>

251
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do this twice.</v>

252
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it gives you like,</v>

253
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

254
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 1>from what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's about twice as long as,</v>

255
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>as like a world record holder can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually hold their breath.</v>

256
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I think he was packing oxygen is totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

257
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:16.180
<v Speaker 1>He's breathing up with pure oxygen for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a long time.</v>

258
00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And it totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

259
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically like,</v>

260
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>it like doubles your breath hold.</v>

261
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it go.</v>

262
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Seventeen minutes and four point four</v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

263
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Bad Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty incredible.</v>

264
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Even with the oxygen</v>

265
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

266
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean no matter how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

267
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.570
<v Speaker 1>how you slice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a long ass time to not breathe.</v>

268
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.730
<v Speaker 3>So he held the record for oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 3>assisted static apnea between holding</v>

269
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:43.520
<v Speaker 3>your breath while breathing after</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing pure oxygen.</v>

270
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 3>That would be super handy for my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pure oxygen,</v>

271
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.000
<v Speaker 3>being able to hold your breath for 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

272
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

273
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:53.540
<v Speaker 3>fuck these waves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these waves and got shit on them,</v>

274
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.490
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just going to swim to the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kick it.</v>

275
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that product that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>came up with?</v>

276
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a bullshit fake product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently people have spent like a</v>

277
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.340
<v Speaker 3>million dollars on this thing trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy it.</v>

278
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a gill machine.</v>

279
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.310
<v Speaker 3>They came up with this thing that allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to breathe.</v>

280
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>It's total bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fake,</v>

281
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.250
<v Speaker 3>but there was like these ads saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows you to breathe underwater and it</v>

282
00:11:16.251 --> 00:11:19.910
<v Speaker 3>looks like like a scuba mouthpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just got like.</v>

283
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.830
<v Speaker 3>It looks like two tampons on each side</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this stupid thing doesn't work at</v>

284
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:26.090
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do anything,</v>

285
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.620
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's this giant scam and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this article about how people</v>

286
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:35.090
<v Speaker 3>have spent like all this money on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake thing that doesn't even exist.</v>

287
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.510
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy what people are right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely nuts.</v>

288
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.030
<v Speaker 3>What people will actually buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This oxygen masks allows underwater</v>

289
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 3>breathing without oxygen tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's total bullshit,</v>

290
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:49.010
<v Speaker 3>so I don't understand where the money</v>
<v Speaker 3>went or how it see if you could find an</v>

291
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 3>article of like what the fuck went</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

292
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>but a bunch of to be like sucking oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the ocean.</v>

293
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how ridiculous is that?</v>

294
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 4>Like people thought that they were fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

295
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 4>that's all you need is this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You breathe in through those and you</v>

296
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 4>pull off to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a total scam.</v>

297
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 4>It's the order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the next 59 seconds,</v>

298
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 4>we're going to throw a second one in for</v>
<v Speaker 4>half of the price.</v>

299
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

300
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would be cool if someone could</v>
<v Speaker 4>come up with something like that,</v>

301
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 4>but that's just not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is bizarre though that there are</v>

302
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 4>things that breathe air out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

303
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 4>They can find a way to suck air out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the water,</v>

304
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

305
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 4>life is very bizarre if you look at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>

306
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you pull them onto the deck of</v>

307
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 4>the boat and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

308
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 4>And then you put us under water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The opposite.</v>

309
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 4>We start panicking immediately.</v>

310
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 4>So the shark thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did they tribute it to?</v>

311
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why they're inviting more</v>

312
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 4>people lately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

313
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:44.990
<v Speaker 4>it's super debatable though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

314
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 4>like a global warming type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

315
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.680
<v Speaker 4>There's all types of stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

316
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot less fish than it used to</v>

317
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing is,</v>

318
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing I think is a,</v>

319
00:12:53.331 --> 00:12:55.880
<v Speaker 4>is a huge component is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that going to sixties,</v>

320
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 4>if someone got bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would do a short call,</v>

321
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people will get pissed,</v>

322
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some little girl get bit and then all</v>

323
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 4>the fishing boats to go out and kill a</v>
<v Speaker 4>ton of sharks.</v>

324
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

325
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the sixties there was,</v>

326
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.310
<v Speaker 4>there was some shark attacks and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a huge shark cold,</v>

327
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 4>like people would just go out and kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>as many sharks they could.</v>

328
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 4>And so it decimated the shark</v>
<v Speaker 4>populations in Hawaii and then,</v>

329
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 4>and then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they were protected in the</v>

330
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 4>seventies and eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now there's this mega shark shark</v>

331
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:27.260
<v Speaker 4>population because they're protected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

332
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.450
<v Speaker 4>you're not really supposed to kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>sharks.</v>

333
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 4>So there's an over abundance of big</v>
<v Speaker 4>sharks.</v>

334
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if people would be the same if</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was dragons,</v>

335
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 4>would we protect dragons?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

336
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.910
<v Speaker 4>we're required.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really are retarded for sure.</v>

337
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 4>We would hundred percent like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to wipe out the fucking</v>

338
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 4>sharks folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just relax.</v>

339
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Skill kill them all around where people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

340
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

341
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.140
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy that they figured out like,</v>

342
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any technology for every single thing,</v>

343
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:54.940
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

344
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking it'd be so,</v>

345
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.363
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

346
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 4>in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we can do the craziest shit with</v>

347
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

348
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 4>Like why can't they put buoys around a</v>
<v Speaker 4>surf break with like some weird magnetic</v>

349
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 4>thing that shoots down to the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean at that,</v>

350
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.180
<v Speaker 4>you know what it's like 30 feet deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 4>like half a mile out from the break and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everyone can swim there.</v>

352
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 4>Everyone can serve their whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell it is.</v>

353
00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Like how come they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems so basic.</v>

354
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 4>It does seem like something they could</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to do like some sort of</v>

355
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:27.211
<v Speaker 4>an electronic fence that keeps them out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they have that for your dog.</v>

356
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can put that on your yard and the dog</v>

357
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 4>can't go past it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it'll probably give you dick cancer.</v>

358
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll probably find out,</v>

359
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these surfers and start getting Dick</v>

360
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody went,</v>

361
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck off the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fence.</v>

362
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Every cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

363
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.080
<v Speaker 4>Can put up the magnetic fence because</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the sharks,</v>

364
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.470
<v Speaker 4>all the sharks or get cancer and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

365
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 4>for Sharks get Dick Cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then Peta would get upset.</v>

366
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.030
<v Speaker 4>He came over to</v>

367
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 2>become a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of sharks.</v>

368
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They scare the fuck out of me and that's</v>

369
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 2>what's keeping me from surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surfing looks like it's fucking awesome.</v>

370
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I see guys like you on those big waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't know about the big ways that</v>

371
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 2>that's beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

372
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Even when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever like this,</v>

373
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 2>this kind of shit that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not designed for that.</v>

374
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

375
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 2>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at a fee for people who</v>

376
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 2>are listening will look at an image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that you?</v>

377
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Who's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is that?</v>

378
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.670
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

379
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

380
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 2>tell me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like I'm falling off the building.</v>

381
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Falling off several buildings stacked on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of each other.</v>

382
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

383
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:32.760
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

384
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.700
<v Speaker 1>actual number right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually felt like I was falling off a</v>

385
00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:39.960
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was absolutely sure I was eating shit</v>

386
00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:40.794
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

387
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.551
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

388
00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:42.211
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

389
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:44.730
<v Speaker 1>it was a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually fell from the top and landed</v>

390
00:15:44.731 --> 00:15:47.130
<v Speaker 1>on my board and made the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big wave at a,</v>

391
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 1>at a wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

392
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:51.090
<v Speaker 1>off the north coast of Maui called jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

393
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.620
<v Speaker 1>how high is that wave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably 50 feet on the face,</v>

394
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more.</v>

395
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.343
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 60.</v>

396
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.900
<v Speaker 2>So you're falling off the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wave,</v>

397
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:05.770
<v Speaker 2>like it breaks and you're coming over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lip or the,</v>

398
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.140
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you call the edge of the wave?</v>

399
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

400
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm falling from the lip.</v>

401
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.870
<v Speaker 1>But the cool thing is you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your hands.</v>

402
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing it with your bare</v>

403
00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:16.320
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this wave comes in and you have to</v>

404
00:16:16.321 --> 00:16:17.610
<v Speaker 1>read the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to time it,</v>

405
00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:21.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to position yourself so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to catch it in the steepest part</v>

406
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>right before it throws over like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he could throw it over you eat</v>

407
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

408
00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you gotta it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so precise,</v>

409
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be able to tighten it on a giant</v>

410
00:16:29.611 --> 00:16:31.410
<v Speaker 1>wave like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially like the bigger the wave is,</v>

411
00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the faster it moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gets really,</v>

412
00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:36.510
<v Speaker 1>really technical and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few successfully ride one of those</v>

413
00:16:36.511 --> 00:16:37.530
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of fun.</v>

414
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets super addictive when you're in</v>

415
00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:42.480
<v Speaker 2>that tube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're slicing through it and you</v>

416
00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 2>see the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

417
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Going over the top of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

418
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.630
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is</v>

419
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.940
<v Speaker 1>so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

420
00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:49.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

421
00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:50.530
<v Speaker 1>it's such a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

422
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super addicting.</v>

423
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.344
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been surfing since I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been surfing on,</v>

425
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.070
<v Speaker 1>on a surfboard standing up since I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>five on my surfboard from my dad.</v>

426
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still totally obsessed with it.</v>

427
00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:05.220
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else in my life like</v>

428
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>that where I'm absolutely psyched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when the waves are good,</v>

429
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a little kid still.</v>

430
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.210
<v Speaker 1>What is it about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude?</v>

431
00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like hunting.</v>

432
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm out in nature.</v>

433
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.700
<v Speaker 1>No one's bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to talk to anybody.</v>

434
00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I can go do my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go down the beach no matter how</v>

435
00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:23.230
<v Speaker 1>shitty of a day I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much stress,</v>

436
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if my kids getting a bad report</v>

437
00:17:25.391 --> 00:17:27.670
<v Speaker 1>card or I had to pay my taxes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it was,</v>

438
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I can put on my trunks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged down to the beach,</v>

439
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.400
<v Speaker 1>grab my board and I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm soon as I hit the water,</v>

440
00:17:33.401 --> 00:17:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I am a bowhunting and</v>

441
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.290
<v Speaker 1>people who don't bowhunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand that.</v>

442
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.640
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell would you do that?</v>

443
00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you find,</v>

444
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:41.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

445
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 1>what do you find good about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like being out in the forest for days at</v>

446
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:46.030
<v Speaker 1>a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

447
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously I've never served,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bowhunting thing is so difficult</v>

448
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.840
<v Speaker 2>and so primal and I think it hits some</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird ancient switches inside your dna</v>

449
00:17:57.361 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 2>from back when people needed a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow to survive.</v>

450
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>And when you were hunting an animal it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

451
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so primitive.</v>

452
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something about rifle</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting that's not nearly as satisfying.</v>

453
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Rifle hunting is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all exciting and it's,</v>

454
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it's way more effective and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly have you.</v>

455
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 2>You'll have more success and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>more range to it,</v>

456
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's not nearly the same feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a switch that goes off that I</v>

457
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>think is like a part of being a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being from the thousands of years of us</v>

458
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 2>shooting bows and arrows at things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay alive.</v>

459
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

460
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 2>that reward is like triggered somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another deep inside.</v>

461
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is that makes you a person.</v>

462
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

463
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 1>it all comes down to the moment of truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you worked so hard for that</v>

465
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.610
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is and elk or deer or</v>

466
00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it is and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you bust your ass and you're on your</v>

467
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 1>hands and knees in the hot sun or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're over there freezing your ass</v>

468
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>off in the dark waiting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to get light and a pack your</v>

469
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 1>shit from the trail head for miles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this hard work and all the thousands</v>

470
00:18:57.031 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 1>of arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shoot your target and all of a</v>

471
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 1>sudden it comes down to this this</v>
<v Speaker 1>millisecond where the elk stops in front</v>

472
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 1>of you and you're sitting there full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn and it's like the moment of truth,</v>

473
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super technical and really</v>

474
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 1>difficult and a lot of people suck at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's so rad.</v>

475
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very technical and that is</v>

476
00:19:13.721 --> 00:19:16.990
<v Speaker 2>something that I just never took into</v>
<v Speaker 2>account when I saw people shooting bows</v>

477
00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 2>and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

478
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.910
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he left arm straight.</v>

479
00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:20.860
<v Speaker 2>You right on pulls back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make sure you aim,</v>

480
00:19:20.861 --> 00:19:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you let it go and seems like Kinda like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rifle,</v>

481
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a rifle.</v>

482
00:19:25.271 --> 00:19:26.980
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sent her the radical,</v>

483
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you squeeze the trigger and make sure</v>

484
00:19:29.051 --> 00:19:30.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't jerk it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're good.</v>

485
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more involved in the</v>

486
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.480
<v Speaker 2>anchoring of where the string hits the</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner of your mouth,</v>

487
00:19:37.481 --> 00:19:42.280
<v Speaker 2>where your hand rest below your jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that your elbows not too</v>

488
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.020
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not too high,</v>

489
00:19:44.021 --> 00:19:45.770
<v Speaker 2>your back muscles are pulling</v>

490
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and remembering all that stuff in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

491
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting to full draw.</v>

492
00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.330
<v Speaker 1>That is the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big difference,</v>

493
00:19:52.331 --> 00:19:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

494
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the main difference is</v>
<v Speaker 1>once that animal's in range,</v>

495
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you still have to get to full draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

496
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And you're not sitting there like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding without making any motion.</v>

497
00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:07.651
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to go full draw and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow do that undetected without the</v>

498
00:20:08.141 --> 00:20:10.660
<v Speaker 1>animal getting alert or freaked out or</v>
<v Speaker 1>running away.</v>

499
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy little addiction,</v>

500
00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.700
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is very,</v>

501
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.800
<v Speaker 1>very crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>

502
00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife would agree with you.</v>

503
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Mine went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

504
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a video of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

505
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.400
<v Speaker 2>you were grilling some steaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

506
00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was access deer at your</v>

507
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:28.090
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

508
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

509
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 2>like the connection that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your food,</v>

510
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 2>like you went and you found that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

511
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 2>that is a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That animal was just living like they'd</v>

512
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:42.080
<v Speaker 2>been living for hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

513
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Just eating grasses and staying away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from predators.</v>

514
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Snuck up on it and you place an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

515
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 1>in his vitals perfectly and cut it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brought it home.</v>

516
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And now you're eating it and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insane connection to your food when</v>

517
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

518
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you look around,</v>

519
00:20:58.481 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 1>your family's eating in like my key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have little kids and they're sitting</v>

520
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 1>there with deer on their fork eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Dad brought this home is awesome.</v>

521
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

522
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:09.810
<v Speaker 1>like I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

523
00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.880
<v Speaker 1>there's just something so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfying about eating food that you</v>

524
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>grew or killed or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

525
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

526
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so cool.</v>

527
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 1>When someone has an awesome garden that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their house,</v>

528
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 1>they busted their ass and they'd know</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where that food came from.</v>

529
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:25.400
<v Speaker 1>It only touched their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

530
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing and it's even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more so when you're,</v>

531
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.550
<v Speaker 1>when you spend all that time in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains and,</v>

532
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring it home and you care for that</v>

533
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 1>meet and make sure it's not dirty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure it's not spoiled and make sure</v>

534
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 1>it's taken care of perfectly.</v>

535
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd go in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my freezer and I'm like a total.</v>

536
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually kind of a slob and a lot of</v>

537
00:21:42.441 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 1>like different areas of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't make my bed a lot of times</v>

538
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now when it comes to the meat,</v>

539
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total nerd alert,</v>

540
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.250
<v Speaker 1>go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything's packaged</v>

541
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's a perfect size.</v>

542
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Everything's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's itemized,</v>

543
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>cut date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal species,</v>

544
00:21:57.071 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a deep respect for that</v>

545
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>animal data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell people who just buy their</v>

546
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>meat at a grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

547
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they could ever understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

548
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I think you can kind of intellectualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and you can kind of imagine what it's</v>

549
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you could ever really</v>

550
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:12.880
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

551
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.080
<v Speaker 1>and I can relate to that because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't always a hunter and I,</v>

552
00:22:15.081 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't.</v>

553
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't brought up a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

554
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't come from a hunting family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in my family ever hunted all new</v>

555
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:24.340
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started when I was 30 and I'm 43.</v>

556
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.340
<v Speaker 1>So what was it that got you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved from the,</v>

557
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:33.040
<v Speaker 1>from the beach where I lived my whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life up to the mountains and um,</v>

558
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I bought a piece of property and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I planted got dug up by wild</v>

559
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's wild boars all over the</v>

560
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:41.130
<v Speaker 1>property and my wife started getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed and,</v>

561
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know what to do.</v>

562
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to plant fruit trees and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and everything was getting</v>

563
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>knocked over and smashed by all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs.</v>

564
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And so my buddy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

565
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>shoot him with a gun and shoot a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

566
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll beat it.</v>

567
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 1>And so he gave me this shotgun or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

568
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I shot with a shotgun and immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave it back to him and I was like,</v>

569
00:22:58.451 --> 00:22:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a gun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

570
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into the loud noises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just was over it.</v>

571
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So I gave it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do.</v>

572
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if I should need a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My property.</v>

573
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want to like mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like natural pattern either.</v>

575
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were there long before I was and</v>

576
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my next door neighbor was a bow</v>

577
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had an extra bowl so I would go over</v>

578
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 1>to his house and have a couple beers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot arrows and once I get group some</v>

579
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 1>arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said I was ready to go hunting and he</v>

580
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 1>took me boar hunting and the first night</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these pays were there and,</v>

581
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I totally blew it.</v>

582
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I got to full draw and my Arrow fell off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest and thing and all,</v>

583
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>they all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all ran and made a bunch of noise.</v>

584
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 1>But that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day I went and bought it.</v>

585
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I used mathews bow down at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>down at the boat shop and you know,</v>

586
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I started a building trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>downs about my house and you know,</v>

587
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to like throw down for the pigs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come.</v>

588
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the hell I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know any bowhunters and um,</v>

589
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 1>so it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all like self taught.</v>

590
00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

591
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

592
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started with a good friend of mine at</v>

593
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 1>home at the same time I didn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any super close friends that were</v>

594
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 1>bow hunters and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny because soon after I</v>

595
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 1>started bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I realized that I did know a bunch</v>

596
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 1>of bowhunters and I immediately had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool circle of friends that were</v>

597
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 1>all experienced bowhunters and they kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of took me in and taught me,</v>

598
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>

599
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 1>what equipment to use and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to hunt.</v>

600
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I had like mentors in hunting</v>

601
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 1>that really taught me how to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to kill animals.</v>

602
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii is an amazing place for bow</v>

603
00:24:28.351 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 1>hunting and a lot of people would never</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined this.</v>

604
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:35.360
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing between axis deer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain goats and all kinds of other</v>

605
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit that you guys and the pig</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular pigs were brought over there.</v>

606
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like hundreds and hundreds of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

607
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Is the captain cook thing wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

609
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 1>So there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there wasn't really no animals in</v>

610
00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single thing there is introduced</v>

611
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 1>except for like bugs and some birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

612
00:24:53.901 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deer,</v>

613
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.420
<v Speaker 1>the pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goats,</v>

614
00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 1>the sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was all introduced.</v>

615
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So you go out in the mountains and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots and lots of different,</v>

616
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different animals out there and</v>

617
00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>they're all introducing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all considered pests.</v>

618
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot like New Zealand and that</v>

619
00:25:09.001 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 1>sort of a way that is new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand has an incredible amount of</v>

620
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 1>wild game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all introduced and they did it</v>

621
00:25:15.801 --> 00:25:20.240
<v Speaker 1>back hundreds of years ago again when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans wanted it as a hunting</v>

622
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they brought over stags and European</v>

623
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:27.020
<v Speaker 1>animals and access deer and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and just let them loose with no</v>

624
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

625
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their populations just exploded.</v>

626
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you came in Hawaii.</v>

627
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like over New Zealand?</v>

628
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Because when you look at the Lord of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rings,</v>

629
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

630
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 1>that's all I know about new New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Kim Dotcom lives there and the</v>

631
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings and people go over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to hunt.</v>

632
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It's very much like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

633
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hunted there this year and we hunted</v>

634
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 1>in some places that like I hadn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

635
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.010
<v Speaker 1>All I do is I take pictures and stare at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountains.</v>

636
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was mind boggling how incredibly</v>

637
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 1>beautiful it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were hunting these,</v>

638
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

639
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 1>these mountain goats called tar from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Himalayas there,</v>

640
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.300
<v Speaker 1>these hairy goats with this big giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>sable for thing and really small horns</v>

641
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 1>and they live and they liked these</v>
<v Speaker 1>glaciers and he's like vertical cliffs,</v>

642
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe like a thousand foot cliff at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of like a 5,000 foot mountain of</v>

643
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 1>granite cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little step ledge in it that's</v>

644
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:19.910
<v Speaker 1>like six inches wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the tar would be</v>

645
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 1>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Star.</v>

646
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Just be standing there looking at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other bad ass creatures.</v>

647
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>They really don't look real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try and go kill one of those things with</v>

648
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 1>a ball on public land and sent me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture and all the hail you forever.</v>

649
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 1>They are hard to kill with a bow.</v>

650
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I tell you that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get one?</v>

651
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw one.</v>

652
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I was at remy who's a friend of yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

653
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

654
00:26:38.351 --> 00:26:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It was a Ramey warrant and we spotted</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and it's not like,</v>

655
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where I come from.</v>

656
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You go hunt access deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see a thousand deer walk in</v>

657
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

658
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Where mark my words dude soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm online.</v>

659
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I hold dear in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

660
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm used to going out and seeing them</v>

661
00:26:58.571 --> 00:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>like tons of pigs and goats and deer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

662
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to New Zealand and hunted these</v>

663
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>tar and I'm standing there with remy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of this valley and we're</v>

664
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.750
<v Speaker 1>hunting or camping in the back country</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>

665
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're glassing and don't see anything.</v>

666
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So we drive like half a mile glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

667
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>and we're in totally in the background.</v>

668
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 1>She went weren't driving straight up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>river like deep in a river.</v>

669
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>We got like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

670
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.810
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those like land cruisers with a</v>

671
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 1>snorkel in the middle of the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like these animals are under</v>

672
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 1>radical pressure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden we see one,</v>

673
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a tar and it's at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mountain.</v>

674
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:38.241
<v Speaker 1>5,000 vertical feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five miles straight up hill or one mile,</v>

675
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

676
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it was was vertical.</v>

677
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It's vertical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

678
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's 5,000 vertical feet,</v>

679
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but you're looking at it and it looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's right there,</v>

680
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's vert right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes you four hours to walk there</v>

681
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.120
<v Speaker 1>because it's vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

682
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw it probably we saw it at like</v>

683
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 1>three in the afternoon and it got dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>at like six.</v>

684
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.061
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

685
00:28:00.061 --> 00:28:02.520
<v Speaker 1>we have three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to close the gap.</v>

686
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.820
<v Speaker 1>We need to kill that tar today before</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>

687
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 1>So we're literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote running up the mountain</v>

688
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.650
<v Speaker 3>as fast as you possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's in pretty good shape.</v>

689
00:28:12.651 --> 00:28:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Remy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a beast.</v>

690
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.781
<v Speaker 3>He's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

691
00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:15.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he does.</v>

692
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:17.660
<v Speaker 3>He lives in the mountains all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's used to that.</v>

693
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did one of those vo two Max test on</v>

694
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:23.430
<v Speaker 3>him and he's got like elite triathlon</v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance.</v>

695
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like half human,</v>

696
00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:26.920
<v Speaker 3>half tar and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

697
00:28:26.921 --> 00:28:31.921
<v Speaker 3>So we closed the gap to about 900 yards</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it got dark time and walk back</v>

698
00:28:32.301 --> 00:28:35.660
<v Speaker 3>down five hours in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

699
00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is proposing you don't realize like how</v>

700
00:28:39.141 --> 00:28:42.590
<v Speaker 3>hard it is to get up one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains until you try it and you go,</v>

701
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.570
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you think I'm in good shape.</v>

702
00:28:44.571 --> 00:28:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the gym,</v>

703
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be a no problem.</v>

704
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not one of these fat guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

705
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

706
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard.</v>

707
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Like any it'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like being light helps to light and thin</v>

708
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.900
<v Speaker 3>where you're not carrying around a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of weight.</v>

709
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guys like remy and Steven Rinella</v>

710
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:07.570
<v Speaker 3>and the guys that do that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will embarrass you with how will</v>

711
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.250
<v Speaker 3>out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are just walking up hills.</v>

712
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.840
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

713
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 3>you're just keeping them at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

714
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 3>at your rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

715
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're slowing them down all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

716
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it does pay to,</v>

717
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:21.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to train.</v>

718
00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Especially like in the mountains like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

719
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're going to go on a big hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

720
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.630
<v Speaker 3>it really helps to train a lot and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals,</v>

721
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've seen goats like on the side of</v>

722
00:29:30.261 --> 00:29:33.670
<v Speaker 3>cliffs where they're walking along a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vertical face and they're,</v>

723
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.400
<v Speaker 3>they're standing on the little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these little two inch outcroppings</v>

724
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.670
<v Speaker 3>and they're walking along on those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how the fuck do they do that?</v>

725
00:29:40.671 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Like how were they designed?</v>

726
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of evolutionary advantage to</v>

727
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:50.911
<v Speaker 2>like walking along the side of a cliff</v>
<v Speaker 2>face like that has led them to be this</v>

728
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 2>bizarre beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like most people don't think about them</v>

729
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 2>like what their capabilities are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do like really strange shit.</v>

730
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I get as far as if they're balanced and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they can make it up the side of a</v>

731
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 2>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at these fuckers.</v>

732
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

733
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:06.470
<v Speaker 2>look at that as exactly how the tar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did.</v>

734
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at something that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even look real.</v>

735
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at these goats that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking along the face of this cliff and</v>

736
00:30:13.901 --> 00:30:18.790
<v Speaker 2>the cliff is almost 90 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost up and down and these things</v>

737
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:21.550
<v Speaker 2>are somehow or another finding</v>
<v Speaker 2>footholds,</v>

738
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.660
<v Speaker 2>whether their whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the side of their body is slammed</v>

739
00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 2>up against the side of the mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making it up this cliff</v>

740
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.000
<v Speaker 1>and they're not forced to be on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff.</v>

741
00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I,</v>

742
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.430
<v Speaker 1>when I was hunting those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

743
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.670
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those goats in New Zealand and star just</v>

744
00:30:37.671 --> 00:30:40.430
<v Speaker 1>below where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like these rolling hills,</v>

745
00:30:40.431 --> 00:30:43.190
<v Speaker 1>like really steep still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was rolling hills with grass.</v>

746
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.030
<v Speaker 1>They choose to be on the rocks because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually eat some weird stuff that</v>

747
00:30:47.031 --> 00:30:50.180
<v Speaker 1>grows on those vertical cliffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wild.</v>

748
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 1>What are they ripping balls the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

749
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I'd be kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal's not forced to be there.</v>

750
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.160
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's choosing to be on that like six</v>

751
00:30:58.161 --> 00:31:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Inch Wide Ledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand feet on a vertical cliff.</v>

752
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that fucking.</v>

753
00:31:02.271 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 2>But we're looking at this picture folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

754
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 2>what was the Google search?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone's listening just like</v>

755
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 2>climbing goat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this picture that we're looking</v>

756
00:31:12.081 --> 00:31:14.060
<v Speaker 2>at now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably like eight of them</v>

757
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're on the side of this mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just doesn't even look real and</v>

758
00:31:20.091 --> 00:31:22.760
<v Speaker 2>the tar does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't look real as it is.</v>

759
00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.960
<v Speaker 2>They look like some sort of a mythical</v>
<v Speaker 2>creature from some ancient Greek novel.</v>

760
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

761
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:31.170
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to appreciate how hard</v>

762
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 1>core that kind of hunting is unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

763
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that like 90,</v>

764
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna I'm gonna Piss people off when</v>

765
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like 98 percent of the hunting that</v>

766
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.470
<v Speaker 1>happens in America is like park a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked to your trees,</v>

767
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Dan getting the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan play play words with friends until</v>

768
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:54.920
<v Speaker 1>the deer comes underneath the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to full draw and,</v>

769
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got your tag filled and which is</v>

770
00:31:58.361 --> 00:32:00.890
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's a blast and I like dress</v>

771
00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:03.590
<v Speaker 1>downs and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that kind of hunting is just like a.</v>

772
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.100
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how hunting is at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clumped in to like,</v>

773
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.113
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hunter.</v>

774
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And as all people sort of need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

775
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 1>there's like so many different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and so many different ways to do</v>

776
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:13.361
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different weapons,</v>

777
00:32:13.361 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>different approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

778
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like crazy.</v>

779
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Like some people are shooting animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had 100,</v>

780
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 1>1500 yards of though with high powered</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifles,</v>

781
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.790
<v Speaker 1>they want to be as far as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the goal.</v>

782
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And for us it's like we want to be as</v>
<v Speaker 1>close as possible</v>

783
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:32.130
<v Speaker 2>that that long range stuff is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange because there's a lot of ethical</v>

784
00:32:32.141 --> 00:32:37.141
<v Speaker 2>questions that come up with that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>any movement whatsoever at 1500 yards,</v>

785
00:32:38.771 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to be like a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking expert marksman to pull</v>

786
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 2>something like that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this,</v>

787
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of Dick Wagon going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're killing something like 700,</v>

788
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:51.080
<v Speaker 2>800 a thousand yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

789
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't really have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

790
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you could get closer to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

791
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the goal though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal is to fight.</v>

792
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can get to 200 yards from any</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

793
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what animal it is.</v>

794
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 1>You can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can get to 200 yards,</v>

795
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you got major problems if you didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 100 yards.</v>

796
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean even from like an antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

797
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.060
<v Speaker 1>You can belly crawl your way in</v>

798
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.140
<v Speaker 2>middle of nowhere to 100 yards from</v>
<v Speaker 2>antelope.</v>

799
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you have one of those</v>

800
00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Ghillie suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know remy has this show called move</v>

801
00:33:18.221 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 2>super slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

802
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen remy show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Apex Predator.</v>

803
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Haven't seen that one though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good show and it's really</v>

804
00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:28.870
<v Speaker 2>interesting because remy remy is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good athlete and he's also just a</v>

805
00:33:28.871 --> 00:33:33.871
<v Speaker 2>really smart guy and what he does is he</v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to mimic all of the behavior of</v>

806
00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:38.911
<v Speaker 2>predatory animals like wolves and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>do like him and a bunch of his friends</v>

807
00:33:40.571 --> 00:33:44.980
<v Speaker 2>were doing some sort of like a chase the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way that a wolf would chase down an</v>

808
00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:49.210
<v Speaker 2>elk and one of the things that he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he put on a Ghillie suit and he</v>

809
00:33:49.211 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 2>crawled up to these antelope and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly creeped is way up to these</v>

810
00:33:54.191 --> 00:33:56.830
<v Speaker 2>antelope and as long as you're patient</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you move slow,</v>

811
00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:59.920
<v Speaker 2>like he got within like seven feet of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckin antelope,</v>

812
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.540
<v Speaker 2>as long as you go slow enough.</v>

813
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mistake I make all the time.</v>

814
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I blow stock,</v>

815
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always because I went too</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

816
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.020
<v Speaker 1>No matter how slow you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should almost</v>

817
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 2>always go slower and well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've found out</v>

818
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Randy Ulmer is famous</v>

819
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.770
<v Speaker 2>bowhunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like probably one of the most</v>

820
00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:21.640
<v Speaker 2>successful bowhunters ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shoots most of his animals with no</v>

821
00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:23.200
<v Speaker 2>shoes on his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

822
00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes his boots off and he's got just</v>

823
00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:29.590
<v Speaker 2>thick wool socks and he just walks you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just correct</v>

824
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.210
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

825
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.530
<v Speaker 2>nice and slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why he's</v>

826
00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:36.000
<v Speaker 2>so successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He realized like,</v>

827
00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:37.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just be walking around with</v>

828
00:34:37.801 --> 00:34:40.890
<v Speaker 2>these fucking clunky boots and snap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>twigs and shit like that.</v>

829
00:34:40.891 --> 00:34:44.520
<v Speaker 2>And so he feels everything underneath</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and it's just like.</v>

830
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been around a bear like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a bear is walking through the</v>

831
00:34:47.041 --> 00:34:48.480
<v Speaker 2>woods?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

832
00:34:48.481 --> 00:34:49.201
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

833
00:34:49.201 --> 00:34:51.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't make any noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of creepy.</v>

834
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Like this big ass fucking 300 pound bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not making a single sound as</v>

835
00:34:56.371 --> 00:34:59.730
<v Speaker 2>it's walking because they have soft pads</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the predators.</v>

836
00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.950
<v Speaker 2>So they just fucking,</v>

837
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.840
<v Speaker 5>I've</v>

838
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.120
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of like the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>

840
00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:11.610
<v Speaker 1>just just creep inch by inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears blow my mind too because you know,</v>

841
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:16.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Hawaii so I don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

843
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 1>nothing about bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they're all like Yogi bear,</v>

844
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're coming in like your,</v>

845
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.470
<v Speaker 1>your jam and hang out and camp with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know this,</v>

846
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want a hug or something like that.</v>

847
00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a man,</v>

848
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I went hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a do it yourself over the counter</v>

849
00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:36.160
<v Speaker 1>tag elk hunt with my buddy from Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were in Colorado and we're and we</v>

850
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and we hiked into area and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited and we don't,</v>

851
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know shit about elk hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not call him.</v>

852
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how they worked.</v>

853
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I read some articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the hell is going on.</v>

854
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.770
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we dropped off our stuff.</v>

855
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>We've got about an hour to hunt and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna come back and set up our,</v>

856
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.130
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

857
00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>our little camp there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a creek.</v>

858
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.370
<v Speaker 1>So I do a big loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come back a little bit early.</v>

859
00:35:56.371 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to set up my tent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I get to one side of the creek</v>

860
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and my friends across the creek setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up his tent and getting like,</v>

861
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 1>like our food out like Salami and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever else kind of food we had</v>

862
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.560
<v Speaker 1>and I was just about to like yell out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him like,</v>

863
00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 1>hey did you see anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like maybe 60 yards away from him</v>

864
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 1>and I looked to my left and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>

865
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>a big bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big black bear standing on his hind legs</v>

866
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 1>look like one of those targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows big old target to shoot one of</v>

867
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 1>those things and he was just staring at</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

868
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.160
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear didn't know I was there and</v>

869
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.340
<v Speaker 1>that my friend had no idea that the bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there.</v>

870
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.430
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting there like butt crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out,</v>

871
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 1>like getting all the food out and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>barest just staring out from across the</v>

872
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 1>creek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was radical and I just immediately</v>

873
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 1>knocked in Arrow and just sat there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the bear saw me and then looked at</v>

874
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:43.500
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at me,</v>

875
00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:46.380
<v Speaker 1>looked at my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was this vertical mountain</v>

876
00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 1>right behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We at the bottom of the creek and a bear</v>

877
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.440
<v Speaker 1>thought about it and then just turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and just hightail it straight up</v>

878
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:57.200
<v Speaker 1>this mountain like he was on the flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground was crazy and my friend saw that</v>

879
00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.360
<v Speaker 1>story that you were telling me before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast started.</v>

880
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Tell that fucking story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That made me really even more scared of</v>

881
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:06.624
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

882
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell that story.</v>

883
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a few years ago.</v>

884
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this story on a bowhunting</v>

885
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 1>magazine and it was a story about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy and his son,</v>

886
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and they were hunting elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sure which state,</v>

887
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The son was in the front and he was set</v>

888
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:26.400
<v Speaker 1>up and the dad was in the back probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 yards back and the dad was cow</v>

889
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 1>calling and there was a bowl there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was starting to.</v>

890
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 1>He was starting to come into the call</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the kid was standing there</v>

891
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:35.300
<v Speaker 1>waiting for his shot and the dad was</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there,</v>

892
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 1>cal calling behind them and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden the elk runs off and they thought</v>

893
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 1>the wind had waffled on him or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

894
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.110
<v Speaker 1>and right behind the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 50 yards past the elc was a giant</v>

895
00:37:46.111 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear standing straight up</v>
<v Speaker 1>staring at him and the kids started</v>

896
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 1>getting nervous.</v>

897
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:56.220
<v Speaker 1>The bear started hightailing it straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the kid and the kid turned and</v>

898
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 1>started running it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dad and as the kid and the and the</v>

899
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.110
<v Speaker 1>dad went to full draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a bow.</v>

900
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

901
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It was archery season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no gun,</v>

902
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.360
<v Speaker 1>so the dad grabbed his bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got an Erewhon,</v>

903
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>had somehow had the clarity to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>full draw.</v>

904
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:15.330
<v Speaker 1>As the kid passed his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dad made a perfect shot on the bear.</v>

905
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 1>The bear right then catches up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

906
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 1>dives on the kid and starts mauling him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ends up dying on the kid and there</v>

907
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 1>was a picture in the article is</v>

<v Speaker 1>kid and he's covered,</v>

909
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.120
<v Speaker 1>covered head to toe in blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear died on him like a heart shot.</v>

910
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Blood all over him for the kid like bear</v>

919
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine?</v>

920
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

921
00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I have kids and I can't even imagine</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what kind of mental state you'd be</v>

922
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 3>in if you saw a giant bear chasing after</v>
<v Speaker 3>your kid.</v>

923
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 3>It does a bad motherfucker to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

924
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gives me the nerves,</v>

925
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 3>the jellies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

926
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goosebumps are popping up.</v>

927
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I saw a grizzly when I was in Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black bear hunting a couple of weeks</v>

928
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look at you.</v>

929
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:22.540
<v Speaker 3>So different than black bears are creepy</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

930
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.550
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

931
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Rinella was telling me a story about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy who first trip ever hunting</v>

932
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.860
<v Speaker 3>gets attacked in his tent by a 500 pound</v>
<v Speaker 3>predatory black bear.</v>

933
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.670
<v Speaker 3>His friend shoots the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bullet goes through the bear and</v>

934
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:39.070
<v Speaker 3>hits his friend in the wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this kid,</v>

935
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.310
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first black bear hunt ever first camping</v>

936
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 3>trip out is going in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is going to regroup.</v>

937
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get to hang out with nature.</v>

938
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Bear tries to eat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his friend shoots him.</v>

939
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 3>They killed the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to kill him.</v>

940
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:52.900
<v Speaker 3>The bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But black bears are scary,</v>

941
00:39:52.901 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 3>but they're nothing like grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This grizzly looked at us and they look</v>

942
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:58.710
<v Speaker 3>at you like demons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

943
00:39:58.711 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 3>They have a total different look in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their eye.</v>

944
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing going on back</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

945
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just dead killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Machines look and feel bad when they</v>

946
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:07.451
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat.</v>

947
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 3>You feel awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gut feel super delicious right now.</v>

948
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.450
<v Speaker 3>He'd be screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

949
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.183
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>

<v Speaker 3>when you're actually around them,</v>

953
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 3>even just around an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you're around an elk and elk</v>

954
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 3>or call and then making those crazy</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.790
<v Speaker 3>And this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this goes on forever,</v>

1035
00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:15.350
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this bull just kind of not sure what</v>

1036
00:44:15.351 --> 00:44:17.690
<v Speaker 3>to do because he's a really young bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at that bowl.</v>

1037
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.890
<v Speaker 3>A spike is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a year old.</v>

1038
00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 3>It's funny how they get so smart so</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>

1039
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.823
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1040
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.380
<v Speaker 3>it's like at that age when it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1041
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.770
<v Speaker 3>once I got like a yearling bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little spike,</v>

1042
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.350
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1043
00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.650
<v Speaker 3>they'll come to any call and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of spaced out.</v>

1044
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 3>They don't really know what a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like.</v>

1045
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they turn into a six by six they</v>

1046
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are not dumb.</v>

1047
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.680
<v Speaker 3>They get turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 3>But like this elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I could kill that Alco my hands.</v>

1049
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I have to see you try to</v>

1050
00:44:44.301 --> 00:44:46.300
<v Speaker 3>get ahold of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antlers are spin around.</v>

1051
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.153
<v Speaker 3>Take his back.</v>

1052
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Rear naked choke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

1053
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking I get his back and he's</v>

1054
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 3>fucking done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1055
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.770
<v Speaker 3>It'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drive for sure.</v>

1056
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he would back straps and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy ride off with me.</v>

1057
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.600
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would load up the barbecue.</v>

1058
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 3>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get her freezer.</v>

1059
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.571
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1060
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 3>those are the most delicious ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you actually can,</v>

1061
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.950
<v Speaker 3>can kill one that that's really young</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1062
00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:12.980
<v Speaker 3>They're really tender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same with deer.</v>

1063
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to shoot,</v>

1064
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:17.820
<v Speaker 3>but this is the thing about elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so delicious that even the old</v>

1065
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:20.080
<v Speaker 3>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old tough bull,</v>

1066
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 3>they taste amazing meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

1067
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because I feel like super</v>

1068
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:27.300
<v Speaker 3>remorseful when I get an animal on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>

1069
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter if it's like a,</v>

1070
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an elk or a deer or a pig or whatever.</v>

1071
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 3>I had this weird feeling when I walk up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1072
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel bad.</v>

1073
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.510
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like just as like heavy</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection with that animal,</v>

1074
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I took his life.</v>

1075
00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my choice.</v>

1076
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I could have let it walk,</v>

1077
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it's like a,</v>

1078
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.730
<v Speaker 3>a younger dear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll smoke it,</v>

1079
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because those are really good eating.</v>

1080
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there trying to.</v>

1081
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.100
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1082
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a list of animals in my</v>

1083
00:45:55.951 --> 00:45:58.860
<v Speaker 3>head that I need to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or are you one of those guys where</v>

1084
00:45:58.861 --> 00:45:59.251
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1085
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to kill them out and go,</v>

1086
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:02.760
<v Speaker 3>I need to get a stone sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get a zebra.</v>

1087
00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And you find that weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1088
00:46:04.641 --> 00:46:06.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a show that I watch you ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen that?</v>

1089
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Miranda's adventure bowhunter show</v>

1090
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.730
<v Speaker 3>television dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a wookie in the mountain.</v>

1091
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.470
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have TV.</v>

1092
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got like Netflix on my computer.</v>

1093
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:19.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of these guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the super slams,</v>

1094
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means all the North American game</v>

1095
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 3>animals and that just seems like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fetish to me.</v>

1096
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 3>It gets real bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think you're losing sight of what</v>

1097
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:31.900
<v Speaker 3>this thing is supposed to be all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1098
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally fine with however anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1099
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.030
<v Speaker 3>if someone's in a getting lions or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1100
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 3>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their trip,</v>

1101
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to judge them,</v>

1102
00:46:38.731 --> 00:46:41.190
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not me.</v>

1103
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a list of animals at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I just hunted mule deer and elk for</v>

1104
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:47.620
<v Speaker 3>the rest of my life and access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear,</v>

1105
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 3>that'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can hunt all year long and never get</v>

1106
00:46:51.421 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 3>bored with those three animals.</v>

1107
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I feel weird about bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bears are the ones that weird me out the</v>

1108
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:58.340
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like killing a bear and eating it just</v>

1109
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.440
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really like one of the best</v>

1110
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like from a conservation standpoint,</v>

1111
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:06.780
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the best animals to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't have any predators</v>

1112
00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.270
<v Speaker 3>and so if you don't kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>

1113
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that kills bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's other bears,</v>

1114
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.530
<v Speaker 3>so they like where we hunt in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant population.</v>

1115
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not uncommon to see 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 beers in a day.</v>

1116
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.620
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really overflowing with bears and public</v>

1117
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 3>service to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1118
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 3>like I take a few bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It decimates not just the moose</v>

1119
00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:29.250
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deer population,</v>

1120
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but the crazy thing is it's bad for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear population for there to be this</v>

1121
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 3>many bears because the boars eat cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daryl,</v>

1122
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 3>weird animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like elk don't eat elk,</v>

1123
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.390
<v Speaker 3>but bears like they're predatory man.</v>

1124
00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 3>They just go for an easy meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an article recently that I</v>

1125
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 3>posted today on twitter that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding the grizzlies are going towards</v>

1126
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 3>people when they have cubs and super</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dangerous,</v>

1127
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 3>but the Mama bears are realizing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're around people that the big</v>

1128
00:47:56.921 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 3>boars won't kill their bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cubs as much to here it is.</v>

1129
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Brown bears are using human shields to</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect their cubs,</v>

1130
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 3>but it's incredibly dangerous for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you're around a mama bear</v>

1131
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 3>and she's got cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll fuck you.</v>

1132
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1133
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to get near one.</v>

1134
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 3>There's another one that I retweeted</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday,</v>

1135
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:22.090
<v Speaker 3>some woman who was in a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was running a marathon in New Mexico</v>

1136
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 3>and she ran past a mamma bear with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>cubs.</v>

1137
00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.770
<v Speaker 3>The Mama Bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just societal Fokker up.</v>

1138
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Just beat the shit out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut Her up,</v>

1139
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 3>ripped her apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she just played dead.</v>

1140
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.860
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1141
00:48:32.861 --> 00:48:36.490
<v Speaker 3>she's really jacked and picture of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>scarred up and you know,</v>

1142
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 3>the bear left her alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some other marathon runners</v>

1143
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.900
<v Speaker 3>came over and saw her huddled up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fetal position off.</v>

1144
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Fucking covered with blood as a life</v>
<v Speaker 3>changer right there.</v>

1145
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the meat bear meat is really good.</v>

1146
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:51.260
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of misconceptions about</v>

1148
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:53.801
<v Speaker 3>bear meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1149
00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 3>apparently grizzlies are nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you get a coastal grizzly</v>

1150
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 3>that's all fall bears in spring bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1151
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Like the taste of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard,</v>

1152
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I heard the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget which one,</v>

1153
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 3>but I heard one is a little bit better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than false.</v>

1154
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Supposed to be the best because the fall</v>
<v Speaker 3>bears are eating berries.</v>

1155
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:12.010
<v Speaker 3>I've only killed spring bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spring bears tastes really good.</v>

1156
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I was saying like from an</v>

1157
00:49:13.961 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 3>ecological standpoint and from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation standpoint,</v>

1158
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:19.670
<v Speaker 3>it's probably one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals to kill other than say white</v>

1159
00:49:19.671 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 3>tail deer because there's so 2 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>or so.</v>

1160
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the number like one point $5</v>

1161
00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:26.980
<v Speaker 3>million car accidents in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States alone.</v>

1162
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 3>200 people die in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 3>every year from hitting deer with their</v>

1163
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is people are so quick</v>

1164
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.920
<v Speaker 3>to point the finger like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you'd kill a bear,</v>

1165
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 3>you can't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just can't wrap their head</v>

1166
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 3>around the fact that they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>those numbers get so out of control and</v>

1167
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 3>the and the world's never going back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it is before we lived where the</v>

1168
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 3>bears live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1169
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That argument's a weird argument.</v>

1170
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their land.</v>

1171
00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I get it,</v>

1172
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter that point.</v>

1173
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:57.640
<v Speaker 3>It's invalid because all the people live</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and when there's millions of bears</v>

1174
00:49:57.641 --> 00:49:58.690
<v Speaker 3>running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1175
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.470
<v Speaker 3>it's not good for them either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1176
00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 3>but even knowing that I still feel weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I kill a bear.</v>

1177
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.370
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1178
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:09.040
<v Speaker 3>There's so much like a dog almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking at enormous big dog.</v>

1179
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.140
<v Speaker 3>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this.</v>

1180
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I think they're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're cool animals.</v>

1181
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I like looking at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>

1182
00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I still want to hug them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still want to.</v>

1183
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that show?</v>

1184
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:21.340
<v Speaker 3>When we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a grizzly Adams,</v>

1185
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:22.960
<v Speaker 3>grizzly Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had that,</v>

1186
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.450
<v Speaker 3>like that was his best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want her to be grizzly Adams.</v>

1187
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 3>So bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't the beard and the hat or</v>

1188
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to hang out and spoon that</v>

1189
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 3>bear every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So awesome.</v>

1190
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 3>I had the original hipster beard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have.</v>

1191
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 3>That guy would get so many chicks right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now in Venice.</v>

1192
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.561
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1193
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.490
<v Speaker 3>He went to fucking owning it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 3>He would be lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it was [inaudible].</v>

1195
00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Sixty eight got a grizzly bear in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>chest.</v>

1196
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Is that dude still alive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1197
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says death is death.</v>

1198
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 3>So I would say no grizzly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so cool.</v>

1199
00:50:57.861 --> 00:50:58.880
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a.</v>

1200
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just died.</v>

1201
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1202
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.890
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Haggerty,</v>

1203
00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I got a,</v>

1204
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I got a Burmese mountain dog</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1205
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a big Swiss dog.</v>

1206
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.520
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

1207
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Is A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's related to a St Bernard.</v>

1208
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's very similar to a St Bernard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

1209
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 3>they're not like a slobbering breed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have slobber,</v>

1210
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 3>so they're really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this really cool markings,</v>

1211
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:26.810
<v Speaker 3>but mine was like 130 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like a grizzly bear and I</v>

1212
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 3>swear I was like living my childhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>dream of being adults because I would,</v>

1213
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I'd come home and roll around with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>big bear,</v>

1214
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he was like a big grizzly bear</v>

1215
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:36.554
<v Speaker 3>who's awesome.</v>

1216
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did grizzly man in like maybe saw a</v>

1217
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Speaker 3>grizzly grizzly adams when he was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>and either that or he had just a bad</v>

1218
00:51:44.721 --> 00:51:49.721
<v Speaker 3>batch or something ripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I laughed the whole movie.</v>

1219
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hilarious moment at the end when</v>

1220
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 3>he gets wasted by the barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was comical sheriff,</v>

1221
00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 3>if anybody had ever been asking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that dude 100 percent.</v>

1222
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it was suicide by Bayer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do,</v>

1224
00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.630
<v Speaker 3>because he went back into the area where</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're not supposed to be there</v>

1225
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 3>when the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animals are in hibernation,</v>

1226
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 3>except for the really desperate ones and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew that they were killing cubs.</v>

1227
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Like that was part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1228
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:18.700
<v Speaker 3>the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stumbled upon these cubs that this</v>

1229
00:52:18.701 --> 00:52:20.300
<v Speaker 3>bear had killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were starving to death.</v>

1230
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 3>The rivers had no salmon there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all dried up.</v>

1231
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 3>There was no salmon run and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting real sketchy.</v>

1232
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.530
<v Speaker 3>He stuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've accepted me as one of them was</v>

1233
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 3>the best trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1234
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the sheriff talked about it.</v>

1235
00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was retarded.</v>

1236
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1237
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a comedy and I want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Werner Herzog because he's supposed</v>

1238
00:52:45.171 --> 00:52:45.801
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

1239
00:52:45.801 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 3>we're apparently we're in contact with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and we're trying to work</v>

1240
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:50.420
<v Speaker 3>something out because he's got something</v>
<v Speaker 3>else that he's promoting,</v>

1241
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>but there's no other documentaries that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does that are funny like that.</v>

1242
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that one is fucking funny.</v>

1243
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it was meant to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>

1244
00:52:58.371 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 3>I feel like human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to look and be like,</v>

1245
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be kidding me with this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some wild people out there</v>

1246
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:04.754
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1247
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Timothy Treadwell desperately wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be one with tobacco</v>

1248
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Speaker 3>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gold.</v>

1249
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm protecting these bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's protecting these bears when he</v>

1250
00:53:16.551 --> 00:53:20.720
<v Speaker 3>goes into those rants because he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would film himself going on like</v>

1251
00:53:20.721 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 3>three or four different grants and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would only use like one of them,</v>

1252
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 3>but some of them he would just start</v>
<v Speaker 3>swearing and you park department and</v>

1253
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.380
<v Speaker 3>where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get like the lost tapes.</v>

1254
00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.580
<v Speaker 3>They had a whole series and they really</v>
<v Speaker 3>took his,</v>

1255
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 3>they took his tapes and they made a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole series about it and it was</v>

1256
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.320
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he had like hundreds of hours of</v>

1257
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 3>footage and he got amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

1258
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:47.840
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented closeup footage of bears</v>

<v Speaker 3>But guys fight them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People fought off mountain lions because</v>

1298
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 3>I think animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this,</v>

1299
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.880
<v Speaker 3>this like tipping point where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:32.550
<v Speaker 3>could I get fucking injured here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I can get injured here,</v>

1301
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to back off and go kill</v>

1303
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's like a tipping point</v>

1304
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:41.070
<v Speaker 3>where the animal realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is fighting for his life.</v>

1305
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is too much work.</v>

1306
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.240

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that brings me back to the shark</v>

1308
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:47.670
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

1309
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:50.880
<v Speaker 3>that that would be like just a horrific</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to go.</v>

1310
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 3>There's those things are enormous and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they want to kill you,</v>

1311
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:56.090
<v Speaker 3>they'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a three,</v>

1312
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 3>but this is a strange animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like nature's cleanup crew.</v>

1313
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Nature's just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1314
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.780
<v Speaker 3>there's just too much shit in this ocean</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we're going to develop this</v>

1315
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.810
<v Speaker 3>insane thing that doesn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even get to sleep.</v>

1316
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Get to see the footage of none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the footage of the surf</v>

1317
00:56:10.141 --> 00:56:13.920
<v Speaker 3>contest that happened last year in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa where the guy gets attacked by</v>

1318
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:16.110
<v Speaker 3>the shark?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good buddy of mine.</v>

1319
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:17.010
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1320
00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.580
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was like a 18 to 20 foot</v>

1321
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great White Shark.</v>

1322
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Pull it out up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

1323
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 1>When I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a plane and that happen and I</v>

1324
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 1>was landing in Honolulu and I turned my</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone on and had like all these crazy</v>

1325
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:32.740
<v Speaker 1>messages from all my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:34.090
<v Speaker 1>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really small world in the surf</v>

1328
00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was like,</v>

1329
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it was no accident that the giant great</v>
<v Speaker 1>white shark was within a couple of feet</v>

1330
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:43.623
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1331
00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.770
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone's like,</v>

1332
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:46.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't trying to attack them.</v>

1333
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:47.080
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

1334
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It didn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1335
00:56:49.361 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 1>White Shark is that close to a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>

1336
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.250
<v Speaker 1>It was having a real good look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck yeah.</v>

1338
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It may not have been wanting to attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>them or whatever,</v>

1339
00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't just get accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in his leash.</v>

1340
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do that right.</v>

1341
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 1>There is a scare as a human being could</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be without getting killed right</v>

1342
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:06.060
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1343
00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 1>And he's looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's behind him and he's swimming.</v>

1344
00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1345
00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 1>That's it in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was body was right there.</v>

1346
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:15.760

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1347
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hard as nails and,</v>

1348
00:57:18.161 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other Guy Julian Wilson,</v>

1349
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.610
<v Speaker 1>that was mick fanning and the blue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>

1350
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.000
<v Speaker 1>He's just feeling when he got up on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>raft and when that was going down it</v>

1351
00:57:28.001 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a full on ordeal of like,</v>

1352
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen like real quick and he</v>

1353
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>just jumped on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1354
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 1>that was like a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of seconds right there.</v>

1355
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Happening is board got taken away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he had to swim and splash you</v>

1356
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 1>splashing water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:41.740
<v Speaker 1>panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other guy,</v>

1358
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Julian Wilson in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 100 feet away and I was paddling</v>

1359
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:49.420
<v Speaker 1>full speed towards him to try and help</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of like,</v>

1360
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like when you show your true</v>

1361
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:51.874
<v Speaker 1>colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 1>that's when you know that Shit's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>down is when you see a friend of yours</v>

1363
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 1>getting what he thought was attacked by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great white.</v>

1364
00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably just a switch that goes</v>

1365
00:58:01.991 --> 00:58:03.520
<v Speaker 1>off in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't even.</v>

1366
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:06.610
<v Speaker 1>It's probably just pure lizard thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:11.611
<v Speaker 1>it's like the survival feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when that thing hit his board and</v>

1368
00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you're in full on panic mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like you have got to get the</v>

1369
00:58:17.021 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck away from this town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other options.</v>

1370
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So I watched it and you see him read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like go.</v>

1371
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:24.000
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reacts super.</v>

1372
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 1>He was ready to like fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that thing was there,</v>

1373
00:58:26.471 --> 00:58:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent sure he started swinging</v>
<v Speaker 1>right it right away.</v>

1374
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 1>If it was right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1375
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I have a friend where I live.</v>

1376
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's actually,</v>

1377
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:36.820
<v Speaker 1>he lives on the same island is me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's from,</v>

1378
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.460
<v Speaker 1>from where I live in a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shark,</v>

1379
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 1>came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs him,</v>

1380
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 1>takes him under water by the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs him with a whole mouth bite on his</v>

1381
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 1>ribs and his head and takes them under</v>
<v Speaker 1>water like six feet under water.</v>

1382
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And he had a straight up punch up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing underwater.</v>

1383
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's beating the shit out of the shark.</v>

1384
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:59.110
<v Speaker 1>He's a big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was at the time he was like 16</v>

1385
00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Oulu and he's a local Hawaiian kid</v>

1386
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:05.050
<v Speaker 1>from where I live and it took them under</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and he's straight up flat.</v>

1387
00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>The shark and I ended up letting him go</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet I think he had like 200 stitches or</v>

1388
00:59:09.251 --> 00:59:13.180
<v Speaker 1>300 stitches or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean his whole side was just cut open.</v>

1389
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's okay.</v>

1390
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine what that would a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little look in there.</v>

1391
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And the thing like looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeball,</v>

1392
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:22.050
<v Speaker 1>been right there</v>

1393
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 4>like staring at him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1394
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said he was just hitting thing as</v>

1395
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 4>hard as he possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Luckily he's a big dude.</v>

1396
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.400
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy that they're attributing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense though to overfishing</v>

1397
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:33.560
<v Speaker 4>that they're just don't have enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat anymore.</v>

1398
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally makes sense.</v>

1399
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how many attacks there are,</v>

1400
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:40.040
<v Speaker 4>like there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been a shitload of attacks in</v>

1401
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot in certain pockets,</v>

1402
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 4>certain areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's one area in eastern</v>

1403
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:47.130
<v Speaker 4>Australia like on the east coast that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1404
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.870
<v Speaker 4>has a ton of attacks and last five years</v>
<v Speaker 4>and another place on the west coast.</v>

1405
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 4>And there's all these groups that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

1406
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do anything to the sharks.</v>

1407
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 4>You cannot do anything of the sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1408
00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.310
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are these groups and what is there a</v>

1409
00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 4>mentalist groups that just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what,</v>

1410
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:04.220
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't hurt nature type of thing.</v>

1411
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Is there a shortage of sharks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1412
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:10.070
<v Speaker 4>I've mad it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1413
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is if they were less</v>

1414
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 4>sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be less attacks,</v>

1415
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:14.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1416
01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>

1417
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 4>There's not a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a real solution where you</v>

1418
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:21.680
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you going to make everybody</v>

1419
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 4>happy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

1420
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 4>you're never gonna make everybody happy</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have a environmentalists or</v>

1421
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 4>animal rights advocates and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of like really fucking crazy and</v>

1422
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:36.100
<v Speaker 4>environmental and anti hunting an animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>rights activists that they're not using</v>

1423
01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 4>logic or conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just love animals.</v>

1424
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Speaker 4>They want them protected at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is they don't have</v>

1425
01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 4>any problem with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking up animals.</v>

1426
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't like people eating</v>

1427
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:49.790
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have any problem with</v>

1428
01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just ripping animals apart.</v>

1429
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1430
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 4>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird because it's like they accept</v>

1431
01:00:56.331 --> 01:00:57.710
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they love nature,</v>

1432
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:01.070
<v Speaker 4>but they don't like the nature of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>human being a predator.</v>

1433
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.700
<v Speaker 4>Like they want to move away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.930
<v Speaker 4>People are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are a trip these days.</v>

1435
01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1437
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.930
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because the whole social</v>
<v Speaker 4>media thing for me is,</v>

1438
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is relatively new.</v>

1439
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.250
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1440
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:16.340
<v Speaker 4>obviously we didn't grow up with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it baffles me because you know,</v>

1441
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:18.300
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can spear fish and I've,</v>

1442

<v Speaker 4>like a bloody fish in my hand.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Great Fish.</v>

1446
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 4>No one says a word about anything that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed a fish.</v>

1447
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.440
<v Speaker 4>You kill a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollow man.</v>

1448
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.850
<v Speaker 4>People just freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what happens.</v>

1449
01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:37.100

<v Speaker 4>Bear.</v>

1450
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:41.030
<v Speaker 4>I can only imagine the more people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>hated me for that than anything I've</v>

1451
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.080
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides fear factor.</v>

1452
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides fear factor.</v>

1453
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.670
<v Speaker 4>They get so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1454
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:47.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating it.</v>

1455
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 4>This is what I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't eat.</v>

1456
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:51.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have such a problem with that.</v>

1457
01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Now I get these done is dumbest comments</v>
<v Speaker 4>like literally like there's plenty of</v>

1458
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.590
<v Speaker 4>meat in the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you have to go and do that?</v>

1459
01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a terrible person.</v>

1460
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not a terrible person because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the store and eat it.</v>

1461
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 4>You're a terrible person because you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>and get your food yourself.</v>

1462
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:06.590
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and kill it because you did the killing</v>

1463
01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:08.690
<v Speaker 4>with your own hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're bad.</v>

1464
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 4>I go and buy it with your money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to be pretty wild.</v>

1465
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.550
<v Speaker 4>That whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just blows my mind because,</v>

1466
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't grow up in a city.</v>

1467
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I get all these people</v>

1468
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>from like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paolo or</v>
<v Speaker 1>someplace in South America or a big</v>

1469
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hit the point I,</v>

1470
01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not pointing the finger at South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans or anything like that.</v>

1471
01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it always,</v>

1472
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>it's always people who are in cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have this major</v>

1473
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>disconnection from their food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1474
01:02:34.241 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live,</v>

1475
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I live in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody I know is a fisherman or a</v>

1476
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>hunter and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1477
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>people have gardens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a way of life where</v>

1478
01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we live,</v>

1479
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>there's tons of fish everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you throw your net,</v>

1480
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do.</v>

1481
01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>They know the eat the food that they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them.</v>

1482
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>And not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just a,</v>

1483
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very typical to be a hunter or a</v>

1484
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>fisherman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know like where I live,</v>

1485
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that's viewed as the same exact thing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen and hunters the same.</v>

1486
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the difference.</v>

1487
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why it's shocking to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the whole how people are totally</v>

1488
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:12.030
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You clubbing a bunch of fish,</v>

1489
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but the second you kill a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just lose it.</v>

1490
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what exactly what you said.</v>

1491
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 3>It's just the disconnect of not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really understanding where their</v>

1492
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 3>food comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not being in any way connected to the</v>

1493
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:29.610
<v Speaker 3>idea of the natural cycle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also a hierarchy of</v>

1494
01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 3>animals that you're allowed to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not allowed to kill Turkeys.</v>

1495
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a fuck when you hold up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead Turkey.</v>

1496
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give a shit.</v>

1497
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you hold up a dead bear and a</v>

1498
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:42.420
<v Speaker 3>dead for a period of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:03:42.421 --> 01:03:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a problem with them.</v>

1500
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Shit about pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1501
01:03:45.441 --> 01:03:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially for takes to.</v>

1502
01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most people.</v>

1503
01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1504
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Bacon everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1505
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1506
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of those boards as that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting filthy animal.</v>

1507
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have my bacon too.</v>

1508
01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you shoot that deer though?</v>

1509
01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have to do that.</v>

1510
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:01.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:04:01.331 --> 01:04:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Well the bear bears are the big ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think in a lot of ways people</v>

1512
01:04:04.721 --> 01:04:08.410
<v Speaker 3>associate bears with trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trophy hunting is something that.</v>

1513
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1514
01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I understand that there's a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in it for the communities where</v>

1515
01:04:16.151 --> 01:04:19.900
<v Speaker 3>they shoot these animals and that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits them and then also they have</v>

1516
01:04:19.901 --> 01:04:22.120
<v Speaker 3>population issues with a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1517
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Like we were talking about it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that happened in Zimbabwe with</v>

1518
01:04:25.721 --> 01:04:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Cecil the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:30.760
<v Speaker 3>How they have to shoot 200 lines now</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to kill them because they're</v>

1520
01:04:30.761 --> 01:04:32.760
<v Speaker 3>just decimating the underland</v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

1521
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those people that were pissed about</v>

1522
01:04:34.901 --> 01:04:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Cecil have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to kill the lions.</v>

1523
01:04:36.911 --> 01:04:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No idea of how it,</v>

1524
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.290
<v Speaker 3>how it works over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only reason those lands are</v>

1525
01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:44.890
<v Speaker 3>alive is because of hunters and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing a million dollars in revenue</v>

1526
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:48.160
<v Speaker 3>because they cost them $50,000 to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lion.</v>

1527
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:50.530
<v Speaker 3>So all that money would go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation,</v>

1528
01:04:50.531 --> 01:04:54.780
<v Speaker 3>hiring all the conservation agents and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

1529
01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:55.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

1530
01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a shitty system.</v>

1532
01:04:57.121 --> 01:05:00.540
<v Speaker 1>It's because they're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it.</v>

1533
01:05:00.541 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Like in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

1534
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1535
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.400
<v Speaker 1>when I bought my tag for Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy it for 600 bucks,</v>

1536
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>like 5:50 goes straight to conservation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's awesome.</v>

1537
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's so many animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really healthy system of how</v>

1539
01:05:14.401 --> 01:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to like increase populations,</v>

1540
01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how take care of habitat</v>

1541
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.370
<v Speaker 2>at a higher more park rangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

1542
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.120
<v Speaker 2>how to buy more land and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1543
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.310
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.600
<v Speaker 2>make bigger reservations and bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation areas.</v>

1545
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think people know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

1546
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Most people have no idea that most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money that goes towards wildlife</v>

1547
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.530
<v Speaker 2>habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maintaining habitat all comes from</v>

1548
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>hunters like 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that there's a tax on</v>

1549
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>sporting goods that goes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1550
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.040
<v Speaker 2>people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1551
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>hunting isn't conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

1552
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunters and hunting products,</v>

1553
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a bowhunting stuff or rifle</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1554
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>they did not fight that tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you knew who did fight that tax.</v>

1555
01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:58.060
<v Speaker 2>All those other companies that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiking stuff and Rei and those</v>

1556
01:05:58.061 --> 01:05:59.310
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want attack,</v>

1557
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 2>so they've tried to impose another tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these people have fought it off and</v>

1558
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:06.220
<v Speaker 2>the reason they fought it off is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to pay it.</v>

1559
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to fuck with their overhead's</v>

1560
01:06:08.641 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 2>going to fuck with the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have to charge for things,</v>

1561
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 2>and so this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that these hunters aren't real</v>

1562
01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.920
<v Speaker 2>conservationist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using it as an excuse.</v>

1563
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.500
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is that's where all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money's coming from.</v>

1564
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.090
<v Speaker 2>All of it for habitat protection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wetland habitat protection law,</v>

1565
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:27.070
<v Speaker 2>all that comes from hunters and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money.</v>

1566
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like if they stopped hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they made hunting illegal and they</v>

1567
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 2>cut off that supply revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of animals that we'd be</v>

1568
01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be.</v>

1569
01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>People don't like it because it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those really weird kind of gray area</v>

1570
01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 2>things or it just doesn't make you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable thinking that the money that</v>

1571
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.190
<v Speaker 2>has come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1572
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 2>the only reason why there's elk and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the habitats that they're at right now</v>

1573
01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 2>is because hunters introduced them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas.</v>

1574
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:56.230
<v Speaker 2>They were decimated by the turn of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century or the 20th century,</v>

1575
01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.130
<v Speaker 2>so in the early 19 hundreds there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few elk left in this country,</v>

1576
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>so the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent considerable amounts of money,</v>

1577
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:09.700
<v Speaker 2>resource man hours moving animals into</v>
<v Speaker 2>these areas like Kentucky,</v>

1578
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 2>like Kentucky has like a huge ell</v>
<v Speaker 2>population now.</v>

1579
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.450
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing there just 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years ago.</v>

1580
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

1581
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.740
<v Speaker 2>So they've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've figured out a way to not just</v>

1582
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.370
<v Speaker 2>maintain populations so hunters can kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1583
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but they've also reintroduced him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where they didn't exist before.</v>

1584
01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Increase populations by a hundred times</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of students.</v>

1585
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean the elk numbers have never been</v>
<v Speaker 2>as high as they have been in the last 20</v>

1586
01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:35.971
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1587
01:07:35.971 --> 01:07:36.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1588
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what they've done and it's</v>

1589
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>all because of hunters and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1590
01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I understand it for people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal rights lovers,</v>

1591
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:49.350
<v Speaker 2>but I just wish they had a more balanced</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and they understood what all</v>

1592
01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>the pieces that are in place are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1593
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.240
<v Speaker 2>it's an uncomfortable thing for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to think that the people who want</v>

1594
01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:58.810
<v Speaker 2>to hunt and kill and eat these animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the ones that love them the most.</v>

1595
01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This crazy thinking.</v>

1596
01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well all the people that are super</v>

1597
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 2>butthurt about the hunting thing aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing anything about it.</v>

1598
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1599
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just being angry and lashing out</v>

1600
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:13.830
<v Speaker 2>with their phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not doing anything to say</v>

1601
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1602
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.020
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are</v>

1603
01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 3>on the front lines in Africa trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>save the lions or the elephants or</v>

1604
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 3>trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to go against poachers and do</v>

1605
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:26.270
<v Speaker 3>something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those people are just are just chit</v>

1606
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 3>chatting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1607
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough money.</v>

1608
01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they really wanted to do the kind of</v>

1609
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 3>work that the hunters who are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd have to have some stream revenue</v>

1610
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 3>and the stream of revenue that is coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from hunting is all coming from tags.</v>

1611
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 3>It's all coming from the sale of hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>gear and products and there's just no</v>

1612
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 3>way they can match that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

1613
01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>There's millions of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of hunters that are</v>

1614
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.150
<v Speaker 3>contributing literally a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

1615
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.380
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more than a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars a year that goes to</v>

1616
01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:52.380
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1617
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1618
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird things.</v>

1619
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:00.080
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it should be cut and dry.</v>

1620
01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think people have a misconception</v>

1621
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:05.210
<v Speaker 3>of about hunting in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in most states,</v>

1622
01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:06.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say Colorado,</v>

1623
01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 3>that the areas that I've hunted there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on a do it yourself over the</v>

1624
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:14.780
<v Speaker 3>counter tag costs me like 550 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 bucks and I go there with my buddy.</v>

1625
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.330
<v Speaker 3>It's in an area that has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1626
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:21.680
<v Speaker 3>a seven percent success rate for archery</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe less six or seven percent.</v>

1627
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:26.000
<v Speaker 3>So out of 100 hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe six or seven people get an elk,</v>

1628
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 3>so all these people are really just</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying for the experience of elk</v>

1629
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even.</v>

1630
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're going in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>buying an animal or nothing like that.</v>

1631
01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm going out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Colorado.</v>

1632
01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:38.750
<v Speaker 3>This is my trip for the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I choose to go out and just hunt elk for</v>

1633
01:09:38.751 --> 01:09:42.110
<v Speaker 3>two weeks or three weeks or one week or</v>
<v Speaker 3>however long you have time and.</v>

1634
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the hunting experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>is all about for me.</v>

1635
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:46.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love them the meat.</v>

1636
01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:48.620
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the successful hunt.</v>

1637
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1638
01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:51.500
<v Speaker 3>I love eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

1639
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.020
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is if I go elk</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and don't get an elk,</v>

1640
01:09:54.021 --> 01:09:56.240
<v Speaker 3>it's not an unsuccessful hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so stoked.</v>

1641
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.370
<v Speaker 3>This is like the best experience ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:09:58.371 --> 01:10:02.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a very enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply rewarding experience just to be</v>

1643
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:05.600
<v Speaker 3>out there trying and attempting it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you are successful it makes it that</v>

1644
01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:08.330
<v Speaker 3>much more rewarding because you know how</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult it is,</v>

1645
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're doing it with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow and arrow.</v>

1646
01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is.</v>

1647
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 3>You have to get within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're really fucking good,</v>

1648
01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:16.550
<v Speaker 3>you could shoot something within 90</v>
<v Speaker 3>yards,</v>

1649
01:10:16.551 --> 01:10:18.680
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get somewhere within 30,</v>

1650
01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:19.280
<v Speaker 3>40 yards.</v>

1651
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1652
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:21.980
<v Speaker 3>It's about Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

1653
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.641
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1654
01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I got sportsmen contribute nearly</v>
<v Speaker 3>$8,000,000 every day.</v>

1655
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Adding two more than two point $9</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars every year for</v>

1656
01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:35.540
<v Speaker 3>conservation hunters and target shooters</v>
<v Speaker 3>have paid seven point $1,000,000,000 in</v>

1657
01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:40.541
<v Speaker 3>excise taxes since the inception of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pittman Robertson act in 1937 sets.</v>

1658
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody in America knows about Cecil</v>

1659
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:47.870
<v Speaker 3>the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows about Cecil.</v>

1660
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

1661
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Only hunters know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1662
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused here.</v>

1663
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:56.800
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says I get the $8,000,000 everyday</v>

1664
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.120
<v Speaker 3>contributing more than two point $9</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars every year for</v>

1665
01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:01.010
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is what I don't understand.</v>

1666
01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.200
<v Speaker 3>It says hundreds and target shooters</v>
<v Speaker 3>have paid six,</v>

1667
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 3>seven point 1 billion in excise taxes</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically that just specifically</v>

1668
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>excise taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a shitload of money.</v>

1670
01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's tags,</v>

1671
01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1672
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>then equipment and taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the taxes is whereas this is</v>

1673
01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:19.370
<v Speaker 2>the billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seven point 1 billion,</v>

1674
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it is tags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is two point $9,</v>

1675
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:23.250
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1676
01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1677
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 2>it's the people that live in the cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are disconnected and I was one of</v>

1678
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you talk to me,</v>

1679
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.110
<v Speaker 2>if you got a hold of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1680
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago when I never even</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered hunting and he asked me about</v>

1681
01:11:36.151 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 2>like it'd be a little assholes shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal.</v>

1682
01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Animals are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of pussies with their big guns.</v>

1683
01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Go buy dog food and cat food because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>love animals and buying ground up</v>

1684
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the funniest one is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans with cats want more than one</v>

1686
01:11:51.961 --> 01:11:52.910
<v Speaker 2>point four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$2,</v>

1687
01:11:52.911 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars through state hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fishing license.</v>

1688
01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>

1689
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:01.830
<v Speaker 2>One point $4,000,000,000 in conservation</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from hunting and fishing license</v>

1690
01:12:01.831 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 2>sales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six hundred,</v>

1691
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 2>8 million from other revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven hundred $49 million to excise</v>

1692
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 2>taxes paid solely by sportsmen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

1693
01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the money comes and if that</v>

1695
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 2>money's not going to be replaced by</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who love animals and that's also,</v>

1696
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:21.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters like the characters in a movie</v>

1697
01:12:21.991 --> 01:12:25.440
<v Speaker 2>like an Elmer Fudd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some asshole who hates animals,</v>

1698
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.800
<v Speaker 2>but when you listened to like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good hunting podcasts,</v>

1705
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 2>lot about conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

1706
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:51.660
<v Speaker 2>the animals they're pursuing and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about tactics and</v>

1707
01:12:51.661 --> 01:12:53.790
<v Speaker 2>strategies and details and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1708
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.110
<v Speaker 2>different areas of your hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different places where you're</v>

1709
01:12:58.111 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>putting in for tags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize like this is a complex</v>

1710
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:05.070
<v Speaker 2>system that they're trying to navigate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be successful.</v>

1711
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult and it's primal as fuck.</v>

1712
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:13.820
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wild experience and like</v>

1713
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.310
<v Speaker 2>literally wild and many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>

1714
01:13:16.311 --> 01:13:17.144
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1715
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.120
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1716
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1717
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't get enough of it.</v>

1718
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.360
<v Speaker 4>I swear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

1719
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.020
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I,</v>

1720
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I measure my success not so much now</v>

1721
01:13:29.611 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 4>because my kids are having a family guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1722
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.170
<v Speaker 4>and that's basically all I care about is</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kids these days.</v>

1723
01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:39.171
<v Speaker 4>But I swear like I measure my success by</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many days a year I spent in</v>

1724
01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 4>camouflage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I know I had a super good</v>

1725
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 4>year is if I went hunting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I swear it's like,</v>

1726
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like if I,</v>

1727
01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:48.420
<v Speaker 4>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I don't hunt for awhile,</v>

1728
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 4>like my wife will call my friend and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1729
01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta take Shane Hunting.</v>

1730
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.840
<v Speaker 4>He's being a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's being a total asshole and you need</v>

1731
01:13:58.891 --> 01:14:01.170
<v Speaker 4>to take them honey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you need to get your fix.</v>

1732
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 4>I know I just get grouchy and grumpy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even really feel it coming on.</v>

1733
01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:07.320
<v Speaker 4>And my wife's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to go hunting,</v>

1734
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 4>but what is it you think that's causing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1735
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:11.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1736
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

1737
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it something's causing hunting?</v>

1738
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Not Hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting is alleviating that and some</v>

1739
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:18.303
<v Speaker 2>sort of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1740
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:20.080
<v Speaker 4>and surfing I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

1741
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1742
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.130
<v Speaker 4>I need to surf a lot and I need to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

1743
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:26.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just who I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like I'm,</v>

1744
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm a surfer.</v>

1745
01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.710
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not what I do.</v>

1746
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's who I am.</v>

1747
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's just being a part of the natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1748
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Like the surfing thing is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you're on a board that's</v>

1749
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.610
<v Speaker 2>made out of composite materials and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1750
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.900
<v Speaker 2>you've got wax on and all this jazz and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all created by a factor,</v>

1751
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.380
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're introducing your life or your,</v>

1752
01:14:48.381 --> 01:14:53.381
<v Speaker 2>your being into the natural world of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean and you feel something like,</v>

1753
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:58.441
<v Speaker 2>they say that the ocean has some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an electro magnetic like feel to it like</v>

1754
01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:01.930
<v Speaker 2>there's something about the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's essentially alive.</v>

1755
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has living things in it,</v>

1756
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but there's oxygen in the water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1757
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.610
<v Speaker 2>that's how these plants grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when there's dead spots,</v>

1758
01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 2>that's why these fish die like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like an,</v>

1759
01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:16.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not just like an ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a giant living thing</v>

1760
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:20.710
<v Speaker 2>and you're swimming around in that thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of absorbing its life for us</v>

1761
01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:24.090
<v Speaker 4>and I feel like it just keeps you young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like,</v>

1762
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:27.540
<v Speaker 4>I swear like surfing a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being in the sun,</v>

1763
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.230
<v Speaker 4>being in the ocean a lot and not like</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there frying yourself or</v>

1764
01:15:31.231 --> 01:15:33.390
<v Speaker 4>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like spending a life in the</v>

1765
01:15:33.391 --> 01:15:35.370
<v Speaker 4>ocean and in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this good for you?</v>

1766
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know people who are in their fifties</v>

1767
01:15:37.441 --> 01:15:40.440
<v Speaker 4>and sixties and nurses healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look young.</v>

1768
01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.360
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have like tons of physical</v>

1769
01:15:42.361 --> 01:15:44.730
<v Speaker 4>problems and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1770
01:15:44.731 --> 01:15:46.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good for you.</v>

1771
01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I think spending time in the outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're in the mountains with</v>

1772
01:15:49.381 --> 01:15:51.510
<v Speaker 4>your bow or whether you're in the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

1773
01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:53.220
<v Speaker 4>doing whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just good.</v>

1774
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly good to be active now and</v>

1775
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 2>it's also absorbing vitamin D three or</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating Vitamin d three through the</v>

1776
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:01.270
<v Speaker 2>song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a rare thing.</v>

1777
01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then coming home with organic grass fed</v>

1778
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:05.780
<v Speaker 4>wild meat is even better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1779
01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:06.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1780
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:08.530
<v Speaker 2>all those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

1781
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.280
<v Speaker 2>you're living a very natural life in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways and that what you know,</v>

1782
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 2>and again it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also the satisfaction element,</v>

1783
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:18.010
<v Speaker 2>just like the people who grow a garden</v>
<v Speaker 2>can Kinda,</v>

1784
01:16:18.011 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>and I have a garden I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's a,</v>

1785
01:16:20.261 --> 01:16:23.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I grow some tomatoes and some</v>

1786
01:16:23.801 --> 01:16:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Kale and I put together a salad when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating that salad,</v>

1787
01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're not,</v>

1788
01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.460
<v Speaker 2>not only know where this came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there,</v>

1789
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I put the seeds in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watered it,</v>

1790
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I fertilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something deeply satisfying</v>

1792
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:41.950
<v Speaker 2>about making your own food that you grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that you go and get as opposed to</v>

1793
01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:43.000
<v Speaker 2>going to a supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

1794
01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 4>only takes a lot more effort to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:46.570
<v Speaker 4>So you just have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1796
01:16:46.571 --> 01:16:48.850
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that elk steak that you eat.</v>

1797
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:50.711
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

1798
01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:54.460
<v Speaker 4>if you did a side like a side by side</v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison with someone who didn't hunt,</v>

1799
01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they may not feel the same way,</v>

1800
01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 4>but because you packed it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put all the time and on the target</v>

1801
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:02.200
<v Speaker 4>you did all the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1802
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like look forward to it for six</v>

1803
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:07.590
<v Speaker 4>months that hunt and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the best tasting steak you're</v>

1804
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.820
<v Speaker 4>ever going to have because you have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pride of knowing that you did it all</v>

1805
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:11.550
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1806
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly a very,</v>

1807
01:17:12.901 --> 01:17:17.550
<v Speaker 2>very different feeling now living in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii and being a white guy.</v>

1808
01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.810
<v Speaker 2>What is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people say weird things about</v>

1809
01:17:21.811 --> 01:17:24.300
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never found Hawaiians to be racist</v>

1810
01:17:24.301 --> 01:17:27.690
<v Speaker 2>or rude or weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard crazy shit and I've</v>

1811
01:17:27.691 --> 01:17:31.830
<v Speaker 2>always wondered like if that crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>is from like rude Americans that come</v>

1812
01:17:31.831 --> 01:17:36.000
<v Speaker 2>over there and are disrespectful or act</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they own the place or.</v>

1813
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little bit of both.</v>

1814
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a little bit of both.</v>

1815
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's uh,</v>

1816
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I grew up.</v>

1817
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:46.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was born and raised in Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I saw a lot of this,</v>

1818
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:48.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in high school and elementary</v>

1819
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you were a white,</v>

1820
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.980
<v Speaker 4>like everybody wanted to be a Hawaiian</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they are young.</v>

1821
01:17:51.981 --> 01:17:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody at my school,</v>

1822
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 4>like if you're white you kind of wish</v>
<v Speaker 4>you weren't really.</v>

1823
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1824
01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:59.990
<v Speaker 4>When you're really young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially back in the day,</v>

1825
01:17:59.991 --> 01:18:01.600
<v Speaker 4>like is it like seventies and eighties?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1826
01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:05.390
<v Speaker 4>So like when I was a kid there was this</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing called kill holiday,</v>

1827
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.780
<v Speaker 4>not making it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like.</v>

1828
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 4>So you know what holly is like a white</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1829
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:13.220
<v Speaker 4>So there was a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was called kill holiday and it was</v>

1830
01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 4>always at the end of the year and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1831
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if they actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>practiced it when I was a kid,</v>

1832
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.710
<v Speaker 4>but it was still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a thing and it was a thing where</v>

1833
01:18:21.711 --> 01:18:25.480
<v Speaker 4>like Hawaiians would be like this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're almost out of school.</v>

1834
01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.350
<v Speaker 4>It's beat up some holly's or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>deal was.</v>

1835
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.611
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1836
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:30.500
<v Speaker 4>it didn't really happen when I was when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a kid,</v>

1837
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:33.200
<v Speaker 4>but there was a thing called kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>holiday and people would talk about it</v>

1838
01:18:33.201 --> 01:18:35.150
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but times have definitely changed.</v>

1839
01:18:35.151 --> 01:18:35.870
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1840
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:37.200
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other thing is like,</v>

1841
01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.230
<v Speaker 4>there's a huge difference between a</v>
<v Speaker 4>white dude who was born in Hawaii and a</v>

1842
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:45.620
<v Speaker 4>white guy who moved to Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're from Hawaii,</v>

1843
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:49.910
<v Speaker 4>like born and raised in Hawaii is</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different than,</v>

1844
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
<v Speaker 4>than if you're a dude from Orange County</v>
<v Speaker 4>that moved to cal moved to Hawaii when</v>

1845
01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.800
<v Speaker 4>you're 18.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like next thing you know,</v>

1846
01:18:57.801 --> 01:18:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to talk like the Hawaiians</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that.</v>

1847
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.990
<v Speaker 4>That's when people freak that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's people lose it when the,</v>

1848
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.380
<v Speaker 4>when a dude rolls up and like with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiian stickers on their truck and</v>

1849
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 4>jumps out and is trying to act like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>local dude,</v>

1850
01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:11.990
<v Speaker 4>that's when guys get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not cool.</v>

1851
01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a cultural appropriation</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1852
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:15.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

1853
01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:16.770
<v Speaker 4>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1854
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:18.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

1855
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets a little complicated.</v>

1856
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:22.340
<v Speaker 4>But if you show people respect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it,</v>

1857
01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're chill,</v>

1858
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 4>if you paddle out in the water at a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a localized break and you're mellow,</v>

1859
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.310
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a bunch of Ding dongs</v>
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>

1860
01:19:28.311 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 4>If you paddle out by yourself and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>show respect and you're mellow than</v>

1861
01:19:31.671 --> 01:19:32.890
<v Speaker 4>everyone gives you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Respect that.</v>

1862
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:34.070
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've always found.</v>

1863
01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:37.330
<v Speaker 2>So the issue is disrespectful people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways,</v>

1864
01:19:37.331 --> 01:19:38.164
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1865
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>

1866
01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.010
<v Speaker 4>it's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like its own country.</v>

1867
01:19:41.011 --> 01:19:43.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like I've never been to Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I hear it's like its own,</v>

1868
01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:46.390
<v Speaker 4>its own kind of place is definitely it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>own country.</v>

1869
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 4>If you get off the plane at my house and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get like a convertible Mustang rent</v>

1870
01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:54.360
<v Speaker 4>a car and someone's going 45 and 55 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lifted truck,</v>

1871
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.480
<v Speaker 4>you don't pass them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1872
01:19:57.481 --> 01:20:01.110
<v Speaker 4>If you pass them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll chase you down and will really.</v>

1873
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just disrespectful.</v>

1874
01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're in Hawaii and I'll slow</v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1875
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1876
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go 65 and a 55 and a convertible</v>

1877
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 4>Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're just,</v>

1878
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:13.500
<v Speaker 4>it's just a strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1879
01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1880
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:15.931
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1881
01:20:15.931 --> 01:20:17.340
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its own kind of place,</v>

1882
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:17.941
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1883
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:19.230
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's occupied.</v>

1884
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of an occupied country</v>

1885
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>

1886
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they don't,</v>

1887
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:25.880
<v Speaker 4>they're a part of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1888
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 4>in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in air quotes,</v>

1889
01:20:27.301 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 4>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a country.</v>

1890
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.910
<v Speaker 4>And then people sailed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're on sailing canoes from French</v>

1891
01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Polynesia with stars for navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got there on their own.</v>

1892
01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Anything with them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1893
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:40.890
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1894
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.880
<v Speaker 4>it'd be 3000 miles or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1895
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:47.460
<v Speaker 4>What in the fuck they did that in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>canoe.</v>

1896
01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even like driving to vegas and</v>

1897
01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:50.544
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey guys,</v>

1898
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:51.960
<v Speaker 4>like we're out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're actually,</v>

1899
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.460
<v Speaker 4>we're not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just going on a cruise.</v>

1900
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:55.140
<v Speaker 4>We're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to become.</v>

1901
01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:57.870
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiians were to bring our babies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have kids.</v>

1902
01:20:57.871 --> 01:21:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Imagine bringing your kid on a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole move to Hawaii.</v>

1903
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 4>They live there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had their awesome system of the</v>

1904
01:21:05.071 --> 01:21:07.560
<v Speaker 4>people in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They trade with the people at the beach</v>

1905
01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 4>for food and sustenance and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 4>they live.</v>

1906
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a mountain people,</v>

1907
01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:15.060
<v Speaker 4>there's the ocean people and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 4>owned any land.</v>

1908
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.900
<v Speaker 4>There was no concept of owning land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will just share it and got along</v>

1909
01:21:18.901 --> 01:21:21.780
<v Speaker 4>and they had their system that worked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1910
01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 4>it was a gnarly time too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

1911
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.530
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of gnarly stuff that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

1912
01:21:25.531 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 4>It was like a radical time to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

1913
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:28.840
<v Speaker 4>if you did something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1914
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 4>you're executed and all kinds of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and like back in the day.</v>

1915
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:34.150
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1916
01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 4>when the white dude showed up when</v>
<v Speaker 4>Captain Cook showed up and the</v>

1917
01:21:37.411 --> 01:21:42.411
<v Speaker 4>missionary showed up and their boats and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were trading a musket for like</v>

1918
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:44.850
<v Speaker 4>100,000 Acre ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1919
01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:49.050
<v Speaker 4>it was like she got crazy in Hawaiian</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and you can feel that nowadays.</v>

1920
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:50.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of Hawaiians are</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting pushed out,</v>

1921
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.240
<v Speaker 4>know all these people live in different</v>
<v Speaker 4>places on the mainland and make a bunch</v>

1922
01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:54.900
<v Speaker 4>of money.</v>

1923
01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.520
<v Speaker 4>And then they retire in Hawaii because</v>
<v Speaker 4>who wouldn't?</v>

1924
01:21:56.521 --> 01:21:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to live in Hawaii,</v>

1925
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.930
<v Speaker 4>but they bring their money to Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It drives the value up.</v>

1926
01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 4>And then the Hawaiians can't live there</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore and they get pushed out to these</v>

1927
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.420
<v Speaker 4>areas that are less desirable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

1928
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can't make money in Hawaii.</v>

1929
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.830
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1930
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:11.664
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1931
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a crazy dynamic and Hawaiian and</v>

1932
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 4>you feel that and I don't know that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'll never get taken away.</v>

1933
01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:20.160
<v Speaker 4>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the last time I was there,</v>

1934
01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:22.200
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at these properties that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were on the beach.</v>

1935
01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:24.540

<v Speaker 4>this beach.</v>

1937
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 4>And someone was telling me,</v>

<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1941
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.621
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 4>stays there sometimes and how the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>around feel about that a week,</v>

1944
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.930
<v Speaker 4>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they spent five years building their</v>

1945
01:22:43.931 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 4>house with like Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Granted that's flown in from Italy and,</v>

1946
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.990
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1947
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.880
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like.</v>

1948
01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess who's swinging the hammers,</v>

1949
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:53.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiians,</v>

1950
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.113
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:57.450
<v Speaker 4>And they have to drive there from like</v>
<v Speaker 4>their little zone or wherever,</v>

1952
01:22:57.451 --> 01:22:58.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever,</v>

1953
01:22:58.021 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 4>wherever they're living,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they definitely don't live in like a</v>

1954
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:02.580
<v Speaker 4>private community by the beach golf</v>
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>

1955
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so how do people feel about those</v>

1956
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.420
<v Speaker 3>people that do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1957
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:09.730
<v Speaker 3>do they get upset at them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they angry at them?</v>

1958
01:23:09.731 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they understand.</v>

1959
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 3>I just think they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1960
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:13.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a difficult situation.</v>

1961
01:23:13.871 --> 01:23:14.401
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1962
01:23:14.401 --> 01:23:16.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a lot of places in America</v>

1963
01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:18.610
<v Speaker 3>really think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1964
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not that unusual situation in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii.</v>

1965
01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 3>It just seems odd because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many of these multimillion</v>

1966
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 3>dollar vacation estates that are bought</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the beach and you're like,</v>

1967
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.470
<v Speaker 3>that's like some crazy fuck you ceo type</v>
<v Speaker 3>money that you have to have to have one</v>

1968
01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 3>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how weird is it?</v>

1969
01:23:37.571 --> 01:23:40.570
<v Speaker 3>These people that come to this place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they occupy the spot,</v>

1970
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:44.140
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been here and their ancestors has been</v>

1971
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:48.100
<v Speaker 3>here for a thousand plus years and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is kind of their area,</v>

1972
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 3>but you can buy a spot.</v>

1973
01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 3>There were five days a week their whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and they can't buy a house,</v>

1974
01:23:53.981 --> 01:23:55.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the whole,</v>

1975
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>

1976
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 3>the whole runway where I live is filled</v>
<v Speaker 3>with private jets.</v>

1977
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Just sitting there waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1978
01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People spend 50 million on their house.</v>

1979
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's every single one of those guys</v>

1980
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:09.010
<v Speaker 3>in the fortune $500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A CEO is all the guys from every big</v>

1981
01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:11.800
<v Speaker 3>giant tech company.</v>

1982
01:24:11.801 --> 01:24:14.000
<v Speaker 3>week a year and their jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so strange.</v>

1983
01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.560
<v Speaker 3>That's a good while to break in when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not there now they got top notch</v>

1984
01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:19.800
<v Speaker 3>security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think they wouldn't use it.</v>

1985
01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Like tech guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne Barr is a friend of mine.</v>

1986
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:24.060
<v Speaker 3>She lives there.</v>

1988
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.720

1989
01:24:28.721 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 3>to live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weather's great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful place.</v>

1991
01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:32.890
<v Speaker 3>No one's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's blaming them for living there.</v>

1992
01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:35.530
<v Speaker 3>That's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is them being</v>

1993
01:24:35.531 --> 01:24:37.630
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful to the people that do live</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1994
01:24:37.631 --> 01:24:41.110
<v Speaker 3>And if you're going to be there,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of magnet for Weirdos and everybody's</v>

2005
01:25:12.581 --> 01:25:16.510
<v Speaker 3>population center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you try to get anywhere even in the</v>

<v Speaker 3>There was no road construction.</v>

2027
01:26:02.051 --> 01:26:02.884
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2028
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Well sometimes</v>

2029
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:08.300

2032
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 4>That shit drives me crazy that a parking</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the street sweeping and then they</v>

2033
01:26:17.001 --> 01:26:18.530
<v Speaker 4>have these like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

2034
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 4>like the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in places like Manhattan beach and</v>

2035
01:26:21.531 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 4>Hermosa Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have like these,</v>

2036
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.340
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the parking meter dudes.</v>

2037
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 4>They have a thing now where if the</v>
<v Speaker 4>parking meter,</v>

2038
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.060

<v Speaker 4>they get like a big.</v>

2039
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Like they know where you are and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>your parking meter ran out and they can</v>

2040
01:26:36.981 --> 01:26:39.380
<v Speaker 4>drive over there and they just go right</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>

2041
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not hyper efficient technology to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give you tickets.</v>

2042
01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Imagine like the revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2043
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:44.864
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2044
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.830
<v Speaker 4>but that's kind of what drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Kinda what I was getting at when</v>

2045
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:50.030
<v Speaker 4>I was asking about Hawaii.</v>

2046
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:52.850
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's different kinds of weirdness.</v>

2047
01:26:52.851 --> 01:26:54.620
<v Speaker 4>There's a different kind of weird just</v>
<v Speaker 4>to live in there.</v>

2048
01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:56.750
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a weirdness to living</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2049
01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.800
<v Speaker 4>which is the overpopulation weirdness</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the show Biz weirdness.</v>

2050
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:02.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you prefer?</v>

2051
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2052
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how I was born and raised</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii as you know,</v>

2053
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:12.560
<v Speaker 4>like the pace I liked the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that no one gives a shit which</v>

2054
01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:17.561
<v Speaker 4>school my kids go to or what I drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one judges me if I drive a shitty car</v>

2055
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.050
<v Speaker 4>or they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You better the opposite.</v>

2056
01:27:21.051 --> 01:27:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2057
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.850
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2058
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:23.571
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2059
01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 4>I dig that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's people,</v>

2060
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.150
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people judge me on who I am as a person</v>

2061
01:27:29.151 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 4>and what I do and how I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2062
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:36.410
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a little bit more real I guess</v>

2063
01:27:36.411 --> 01:27:37.290
<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2064
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:40.040
<v Speaker 4>more down to earth where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also don't live in like the,</v>

2065
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in kind of a small town,</v>

2066
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 4>so it's like coffee farms and ranches</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's pretty chill where I live.</v>

2067
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2068
01:27:47.811 --> 01:27:49.880
<v Speaker 4>that's the weirdest thing about the big</v>
<v Speaker 4>island.</v>

2069
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:51.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of the big island.</v>

2070
01:27:51.711 --> 01:27:54.560
<v Speaker 4>I love visiting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the craziest things about it</v>

2071
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 4>is there's so many different ecosystems</v>
<v Speaker 4>in one island or you drive through this</v>

2072
01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 4>one area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like completely dry.</v>

2073
01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.820
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a desert and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>into another area is constantly raining.</v>

2074
01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:07.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like a tropical rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Hilo,</v>

2075
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:09.200
<v Speaker 4>like up in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2076
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.570
<v Speaker 4>it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2077
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should look it up.</v>

2078
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:13.990
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have uh,</v>

2079
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big island of Hawaii,</v>

2080
01:28:15.111 --> 01:28:18.740
<v Speaker 4>there's like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a climate zones and they always say</v>

2081
01:28:18.741 --> 01:28:21.500
<v Speaker 4>that I forgot the exact numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like out of the,</v>

2082
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.530
<v Speaker 4>out of like these certain sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>climate zones throughout the world,</v>

2083
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:27.290
<v Speaker 4>like the Big island has like 11 of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>13 or something like that.</v>

2084
01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 4>So like if you get in your car and drive</v>
<v Speaker 4>for two hours,</v>

2085
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:35.090
<v Speaker 4>you'll go through like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you just like happen to like go</v>

2086
01:28:35.091 --> 01:28:37.760
<v Speaker 4>to sleep and wake up like 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 4>later everything looks different and go</v>

2087
01:28:37.761 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 4>to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up 15 minutes later,</v>

2088
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:42.170
<v Speaker 4>everything looks different and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes so much.</v>

2089
01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:43.004
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's wild,</v>

2090
01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:48.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like a lot of feel desert and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a dry land forest and there's like</v>

2091
01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:51.830
<v Speaker 4>a rain forest and jungle and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>

2092
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the other thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>big island is that there's sometimes</v>

2093
01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.630
<v Speaker 4>snow there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2094
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:59.480
<v Speaker 4>go snowboarding sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

2095
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:02.970
<v Speaker 4>Where's the happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like build a kicker and like launch off</v>

2096
01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:03.804
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2097
01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 4>that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when it was snowing and I was in</v>

2098
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 4>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we drive up there,</v>

2099
01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I try to go every year to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>observatory.</v>

2100
01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Keck observatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.880
<v Speaker 2>When it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's no moon,</v>

2102
01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:20.970
<v Speaker 2>so you could see the stars just to freak</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself out because I went once many</v>

2103
01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:25.180
<v Speaker 2>years ago and it just changed my world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I am the one experience changed the</v>

2104
01:29:25.181 --> 01:29:27.070
<v Speaker 2>way it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally being on a spaceship and</v>

2105
01:29:27.071 --> 01:29:29.390
<v Speaker 2>changed the way I looked at the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>because um,</v>

2106
01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:32.860
<v Speaker 2>for people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these light diffusers.</v>

2107
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:37.570
<v Speaker 2>There's diffused light lamps all around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big island so that it doesn't give</v>

2108
01:29:37.571 --> 01:29:39.550
<v Speaker 2>any light pollution to the keck</v>
<v Speaker 2>observatory.</v>

2109
01:29:39.551 --> 01:29:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Which one of the biggest telescopes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the continental United States or in the</v>

2110
01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>continental United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2111
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:47.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not technically in the U,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s in the world.</v>

2112
01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I think even the clarity and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2113
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:52.390
<v Speaker 2>and no light pollution there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

2114
01:29:52.391 --> 01:29:55.730
<v Speaker 2>You go up there and you see every star</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just seems.</v>

2115
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:59.590
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you're on a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're on a spaceship and</v>

2116
01:29:59.591 --> 01:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you're looking through a portal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2117
01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:03.400
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's literally what it looks like.</v>

2118
01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

2119
01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.610
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost hurts your brain.</v>

2120
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this up there all the time?</v>

2121
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Not to open a can of worms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but did you follow that whole a</v>

2122
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:13.970
<v Speaker 4>telescope thing last year on the Big</v>
<v Speaker 4>Island?</v>

2123
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the construction.</v>

2124
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Thirty meter telescope</v>

2125
01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.200
<v Speaker 2>that they were trying to do and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it was sacred lands.</v>

2126
01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.530
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't build it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:30:20.531 --> 01:30:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Well explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are up on it.</v>

2128
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.331
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2129
01:30:23.331 --> 01:30:24.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2130
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:25.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the land,</v>

2131
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:30.670
<v Speaker 4>the land where the telescopes are built</v>
<v Speaker 4>are considered sacred land by a lot of.</v>

2132
01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean basically like every single</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiian group that there is,</v>

2133
01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.570
<v Speaker 4>but there's a designated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a designated area within that</v>

2134
01:30:38.571 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 4>sacred land that is designated for like</v>
<v Speaker 4>astronomy and you know,</v>

2135
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.603
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2136
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:48.860
<v Speaker 4>but they have like all these giant giant</v>
<v Speaker 4>telescopes that are owned by different</v>

2137
01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:50.930
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like China has theirs and the US has</v>

2138
01:30:50.931 --> 01:30:52.820
<v Speaker 4>theirs and Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2139
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:53.571
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like.</v>

2140
01:30:53.571 --> 01:30:56.690
<v Speaker 4>All these big countries span all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of dollars to make their</v>

2141
01:30:56.691 --> 01:30:59.870
<v Speaker 4>telescopes and there's some of them that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are completely obsolete and they're not</v>

2142
01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:03.830
<v Speaker 4>even being used anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so instead of taking those four or five</v>

2143
01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:06.260
<v Speaker 4>down that they're not even using anymore</v>
<v Speaker 4>and building a new big one,</v>

2144
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:07.730
<v Speaker 4>they just wanted to build a whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>another big one.</v>

2145
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:11.480
<v Speaker 4>So there was people were up in arms</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and it was going to be the</v>

2146
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:13.040
<v Speaker 4>largest building on the big island as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2147
01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:15.640
<v Speaker 4>so people were just up in arms about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2148
01:31:15.710 --> 01:31:17.620
<v Speaker 4>and there was all kinds of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2149
01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:21.950
<v Speaker 4>people got super activated and really</v>
<v Speaker 4>started protesting the whole thing and</v>

2150
01:31:21.951 --> 01:31:25.400
<v Speaker 4>blocking the road and people were</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting arrested and all my friends were</v>

2151
01:31:25.401 --> 01:31:28.520
<v Speaker 4>involved and everybody was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was against it and protesting.</v>

2152
01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty wild</v>

2153
01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:32.260
<v Speaker 2>because they just didn't want the</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction to continue and make bigger</v>

2154
01:31:32.261 --> 01:31:34.420
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they felt it seems inefficient.</v>

2155
01:31:34.421 --> 01:31:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they should be able to</v>

2156
01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:38.560
<v Speaker 2>take down the old ones and put up a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern one.</v>

2157
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:39.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

2158
01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.400
<v Speaker 4>there was not really any Hawaiian groups</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were against the technology and</v>

2159
01:31:43.401 --> 01:31:46.430
<v Speaker 4>against the space exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't anything about that.</v>

2160
01:31:46.431 --> 01:31:49.220
<v Speaker 4>It was the fact that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they felt like they were being</v>

2161
01:31:49.221 --> 01:31:52.010
<v Speaker 4>disrespect because it was sacred land</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was not meant to,</v>

2162
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build giant observatories there.</v>

2163
01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.570
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that there was all these</v>

2164
01:31:56.571 --> 01:31:59.780
<v Speaker 4>ones that weren't being used is not in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the front.</v>

2165
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Crazy is actually my truck is in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

2166
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 4>happens around here all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.410
<v Speaker 4>It was a wild time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2168
01:32:07.411 --> 01:32:10.300
<v Speaker 4>and it was a weird because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2169
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:11.463
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2170
01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:13.240
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the construction company that was</v>

2171
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:16.540
<v Speaker 4>building it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had the permit already had the</v>

2172
01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 4>financing already and they had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiian government backing,</v>

2173
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.750
<v Speaker 4>backing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was over.</v>

2174
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.990
<v Speaker 4>I thought for sure there was no way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop the thing and it was amazing.</v>

2175
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Like people really got activated like</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

2176
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:31.470
<v Speaker 4>through social media and everybody just</v>
<v Speaker 4>got up in arms about it.</v>

2177
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Everyone around the world knew about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2178
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 4>and they ended up stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

2179
01:32:35.231 --> 01:32:37.690
<v Speaker 4>Is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's a good thing or a bad</v>

2180
01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 4>thing because I'm a big fan of space</v>
<v Speaker 4>exploration and I'm a big fan of what</v>

2181
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:44.070
<v Speaker 4>they find out what these telescopes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2182
01:32:44.530 --> 01:32:48.090
<v Speaker 4>But it seems like if they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>telescopes through not using anymore,</v>

2183
01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's just a financial issue or</v>
<v Speaker 4>cost a lot of money to break them down</v>

2184
01:32:51.551 --> 01:32:56.551
<v Speaker 4>and put a new one in the place and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as financially efficient as starting</v>

2185
01:32:58.001 --> 01:32:58.650
<v Speaker 4>a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2186
01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:01.180
<v Speaker 4>it's always one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's,</v>

2187
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:02.103
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2188
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 4>in white everything sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you have enough money.</v>

2189
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:07.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like America in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you,</v>

2190
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:10.260
<v Speaker 4>if you want that beach front house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>

2191
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 4>You can't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2192
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:12.550
<v Speaker 4>you got enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No worries.</v>

2193
01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're willing to pay like crazy for</v>

2194
01:33:14.231 --> 01:33:14.650
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 4>So if you want to build a observatory on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big island,</v>

2196
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:23.970
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it unless you have enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>money to put $100 million into the,</v>

2197
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.440
<v Speaker 4>into the education system in Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 4>grease all the right politicians and get</v>

2198
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:30.840
<v Speaker 4>it all through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah,</v>

2199
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:33.970
<v Speaker 4>a lot has to happen for one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things to be built and then the</v>

2200
01:33:33.971 --> 01:33:35.620
<v Speaker 4>contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's fighting over like the</v>

2201
01:33:35.621 --> 01:33:38.590
<v Speaker 4>building contracts because it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>cost two point $8 billion to build a</v>

2202
01:33:38.591 --> 01:33:40.810
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot going on,</v>

2203
01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840
<v Speaker 4>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2204
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:45.400
<v Speaker 4>a lot of crazy politics happening behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scenes to get that space exploration</v>

2205
01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's unfortunate.</v>

2206
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:49.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think there's more than</v>

2207
01:33:49.931 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 4>100,000 people on the whole island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2208
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2209
01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:53.240

<v Speaker 4>How many people live?</v>

2211
01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 4>Long Island?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's roughly between 150 and</v>

2212
01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:02.470
<v Speaker 4>200,000 now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when did that change?</v>

2213
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 4>That's just slowly going out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people are moving there,</v>

2214
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.910
<v Speaker 4>especially to the Kona side where I</v>
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>

2215
01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:09.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot more people moving there</v>

<v Speaker 4>But it took a while until,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until she got friends there,</v>

2392
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:45.840
<v Speaker 4>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole Hawaii thing was on thin ice.</v>

2393
01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 4>That's how it always is though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people,</v>

2394
01:40:47.971 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you move to a new place,</v>

2395
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:51.960
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking hard to be alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to be lonely.</v>

2396
01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 4>It's lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to meet people that you actually</v>

2397
01:40:54.221 --> 01:40:55.390
<v Speaker 4>liked to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2398
01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:57.580
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're from La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moved to Hawaii.</v>

2399
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:59.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2400
01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:01.440
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's not like a whole,</v>

2401
01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 4>she's not like a local,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a local girl,</v>

2402
01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a typical local girl.</v>

2403
01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't get myself in hot water,</v>

2404
01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:11.500
<v Speaker 4>but she wasn't one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was,</v>

2405
01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:14.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just had a hard time finding that</v>

2406
01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.500
<v Speaker 4>first good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was California nysed.</v>

2407
01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.020
<v Speaker 4>Well I would think that like activities</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for you surfing,</v>

2409
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 4>obviously you wouldn't meet other</v>
<v Speaker 4>surfers.</v>

2410
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.460
<v Speaker 4>A bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd meet other bowhunters,</v>

2411
01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 4>you find common ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd make some friends if you had to</v>

2412
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:33.970
<v Speaker 4>move to a place like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't have like a real</v>

2413
01:41:33.971 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 4>obvious thing that you like to do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people like to do as well.</v>

2414
01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:39.310
<v Speaker 4>I would say that would become a real</v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

2415
01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.480
<v Speaker 4>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would because you know,</v>

2416
01:41:42.230 --> 01:41:45.250
<v Speaker 4>I think you feel like you lose your</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and that's the way to live and</v>

2417
01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.920
<v Speaker 4>no you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to like move somewhere or</v>

2418
01:41:47.921 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 4>live some life where you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what's going on or don't know why</v>

2419
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:52.990
<v Speaker 4>you're doing what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me it would be super hard to not be</v>

2420
01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 4>around comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2421
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.210
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm so used to being around fucked</v>
<v Speaker 4>up people that make jokes about</v>

2422
01:41:58.211 --> 01:42:02.890
<v Speaker 4>everything and anything and comedians</v>
<v Speaker 4>are just so unusual in the way they</v>

2423
01:42:02.891 --> 01:42:04.830
<v Speaker 4>behave and you get used to them.</v>

2424
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 4>It becomes normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2425
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:10.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm used to being around the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>store and places like that and just the</v>

2426
01:42:10.061 --> 01:42:12.670
<v Speaker 4>sharpness and the quickness and that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2427
01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:17.690
<v Speaker 4>that people's brains work in comedy or</v>
<v Speaker 4>even just even just in La,</v>

2428
01:42:18.161 --> 01:42:22.660
<v Speaker 4>just the pace of how quick people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking and talking and acting and</v>

2429
01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:25.690
<v Speaker 4>being in living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you go to a place like Hawaii.</v>

2430
01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.710
<v Speaker 4>It takes most people like three or four</v>
<v Speaker 4>or five days or a week to just chill the</v>

2431
01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:31.530
<v Speaker 4>hell out and relax a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2432
01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:35.230
<v Speaker 4>just unwind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe just on vacation and that's why</v>

2433
01:42:35.231 --> 01:42:38.410
<v Speaker 4>the whole like bow hunting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how good does it feel to just</v>

2434
01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 4>unplug your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels good.</v>

2435
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turn my phone off and leave it behind</v>

2436
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.450
<v Speaker 4>and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2437
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it also feel weird when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>place that has no signals?</v>

2438
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.200
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing going on there.</v>

2439
01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:51.400
<v Speaker 4>There's no phone signal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no Wifi.</v>

2440
01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:53.800
<v Speaker 4>It almost feels like the air feels</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2441
01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:55.400
<v Speaker 4>The ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2442
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:59.170
<v Speaker 4>ultimate excuse though to why you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get back to people because I'm terrible.</v>

2443
01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.370
<v Speaker 4>I hate the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate it with a passion text message.</v>

2444
01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Fine email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't call me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2447
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:12.270
<v Speaker 4>actual phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way Too into constantly interacting with</v>

2448
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.850
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to communicate when I want to</v>

2449
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:17.200
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my text messages.</v>

2450
01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.990
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can text someone and when</v>

2451
01:43:19.991 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 4>they feel like they're gonna answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no text messages is really good in that</v>

2452
01:43:24.191 --> 01:43:24.980
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2453
01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:28.990
<v Speaker 4>I used to think text messages were</v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid and now I think like phone calls</v>

2454
01:43:28.991 --> 01:43:31.360
<v Speaker 4>are stupid for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same even email.</v>

2455
01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:35.590
<v Speaker 4>It's also you don't have enough time</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people constantly being on their</v>

2456
01:43:35.591 --> 01:43:38.570
<v Speaker 4>phone and constantly like being</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to things.</v>

2457
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:41.920
<v Speaker 4>You remember a time where there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>reflection alone time,</v>

2458
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:43.990
<v Speaker 4>relaxing time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just thinking about shit.</v>

2459
01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2460
01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:48.280
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for me at least that's what I</v>

2461
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:51.740
<v Speaker 4>make a lot of my life decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where I want to go or what</v>

2462
01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 4>direction</v>

2463
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I want to go when I'm alone and I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>just think about what's going on,</v>

2464
01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's bugging me about my life.</v>

2465
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Like this is too busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too much bullshit,</v>

2466
01:43:59.571 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 2>this is too much hassle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get the fuck away from that.</v>

2467
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And when I'm constantly on the grind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think like that.</v>

2468
01:44:06.670 --> 01:44:08.070
<v Speaker 2>My constantly on the grind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2469
01:44:08.071 --> 01:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to juggle this and then this is</v>

2470
01:44:09.471 --> 01:44:11.030
<v Speaker 2>coming on and then that's coming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

2471
01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's appealing to me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place like Hawaii is like there's no</v>

2472
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:16.410

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:29.490
<v Speaker 4>like all my sleeping gear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times I'll do the baby thing</v>

2506
01:45:29.491 --> 01:45:32.160
<v Speaker 4>where you hunt all day and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep wherever it gets dark,</v>

2507
01:45:32.190 --> 01:45:33.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the best.</v>

2508
01:45:33.181 --> 01:45:34.840
<v Speaker 4>But just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2509
01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.250
<v Speaker 4>you know what you were saying about</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2510
01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being alone to think finally,</v>

2511
01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.070
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

2512
01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:44.460
<v Speaker 4>like even it's like we're so used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>being entertained all the time.</v>

2513
01:45:44.730 --> 01:45:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that like people</v>

2514
01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:48.750
<v Speaker 4>are addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whether it's your phone or even</v>

2515
01:45:48.751 --> 01:45:51.360
<v Speaker 4>like if me and you went hunting a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2516
01:45:51.570 --> 01:45:54.300
<v Speaker 4>I'd be your entertainment or you'd be my</v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment,</v>

2517
01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:58.650
<v Speaker 4>but when no one's entertaining you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're by yourself and you're just out</v>

2518
01:45:58.651 --> 01:46:01.480
<v Speaker 4>there and you're making your own fires</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're waking up and,</v>

2519
01:46:01.530 --> 01:46:04.200
<v Speaker 4>and you're doing your own hunt and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not relying on a guide or a</v>

2520
01:46:04.201 --> 01:46:05.630
<v Speaker 4>friend or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2521
01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to hunt over there.</v>

2522
01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.000
<v Speaker 4>You Hunt over here and you're just doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own thing and even if you're not</v>

2523
01:46:09.001 --> 01:46:10.500
<v Speaker 4>even a hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just being silent,</v>

2524
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:13.200
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking to yourself so you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not talking to anybody.</v>

2525
01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:15.750
<v Speaker 4>You're not talking to your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not communicating with anyone.</v>

2526
01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:19.740
<v Speaker 4>And after four or five days I did this</v>
<v Speaker 4>at home,</v>

2527
01:46:20.190 --> 01:46:22.200
<v Speaker 4>I did a hunt where I left my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had my wife,</v>

2528
01:46:22.201 --> 01:46:25.770
<v Speaker 4>dropped me off and I ended this long</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk over this giant mountain,</v>

2529
01:46:26.610 --> 01:46:31.020
<v Speaker 4>bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was awesomely fun and I camped</v>

2530
01:46:31.021 --> 01:46:35.340
<v Speaker 4>out for like four days and I ended up</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurting my leg really bad.</v>

2531
01:46:35.341 --> 01:46:39.630
<v Speaker 4>I like pulled a muscle behind my knee</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was planning on going back and</v>

2532
01:46:39.631 --> 01:46:44.631
<v Speaker 4>having my wife picked me up again and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm halfway there and normally you have</v>

2533
01:46:45.511 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 4>no service in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a black zone and so I hiked to</v>

2534
01:46:49.711 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 4>an area where I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found service and I couldn't walk</v>

2535
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:54.774
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

2536
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was too screwed up.</v>

2537
01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 4>My knee was screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2538
01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.250
<v Speaker 4>I called my friend who had access to</v>
<v Speaker 4>enroll to,</v>

2539
01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:02.820
<v Speaker 4>to a ranch at the very top of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>ranch.</v>

2540
01:47:02.821 --> 01:47:06.360
<v Speaker 4>I could walk to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like another day's walk and a</v>

2541
01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:07.750
<v Speaker 4>whole day walking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2542
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:09.690
<v Speaker 4>with a fucked up leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Slowly walking and I called him and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2544
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:15.444
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2545
01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.390
<v Speaker 4>can you pick me up on Tuesday at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rat?</v>

2546
01:47:17.391 --> 01:47:17.821
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can come pick you up at the top.</v>

2548
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.330
<v Speaker 4>And so he picks me up and after five</v>
<v Speaker 4>days he got out of the,</v>

2549
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:28.410
<v Speaker 4>out of the car and he was talking to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm talking to you.</v>

2550
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 4>And it sounded like he was yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2551
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so used to like this silence that was,</v>

2553
01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 4>sounded like he was yelling at me and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like staring at him.</v>

2554
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:42.560
<v Speaker 4>I must've been looking at them really</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2557
01:47:49.011 --> 01:47:52.520
<v Speaker 4>like no communication for like at least</v>
<v Speaker 4>three days.</v>

2558
01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for,</v>

<v Speaker 4>just for good experience.</v>

2560
01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Adam Green Tree is from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia?</v>

2561
01:47:56.731 --> 01:47:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2562
01:47:57.450 --> 01:47:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I was hunting with them just maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 3>month ago.</v>

2563
01:47:59.490 --> 01:48:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he,</v>

2565
01:48:01.251 --> 01:48:04.590
<v Speaker 3>he's a good buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been bear hunting before he hung</v>

2566
01:48:04.591 --> 01:48:06.330
<v Speaker 3>out with them and cap been great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Guy.</v>

2567
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Hung out with them in Australia when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was there for the UFC to.</v>

2568
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:11.040
<v Speaker 3>He is a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a bad ass hunter.</v>

2569
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.990
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad ass on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2570
01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 3>he's just a bad ass dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was telling me that when he goes</v>

2571
01:48:16.021 --> 01:48:21.021
<v Speaker 3>off to these trips because he does most</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his hunt solo and that's like really,</v>

2572
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.420
<v Speaker 3>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He detaches and you like centers</v>

2573
01:48:24.421 --> 01:48:27.240
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he says he comes back after being</v>

2574
01:48:27.241 --> 01:48:31.770
<v Speaker 3>out there for eight or nine days and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>hasn't said a word in eight or nine</v>

2575
01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:33.810
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says it just feels weird to talk to</v>

2576
01:48:33.811 --> 01:48:34.430
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2577
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:36.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just feels weird to say words.</v>

2578
01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

2579
01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.190
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool man.</v>

2580
01:48:40.191 --> 01:48:43.370
<v Speaker 4>It puts a lot of shit and perspective</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you're planning on doing and</v>

2581
01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:45.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next 10 years or what's happening in</v>

2582
01:48:45.891 --> 01:48:47.450
<v Speaker 4>your life or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

2583
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:49.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to get deep in here,</v>

2584
01:48:49.851 --> 01:48:51.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a trip man.</v>

2585
01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:52.670
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>

2586
01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:56.320
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did nine days by myself in Colorado</v>

2587
01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.760
<v Speaker 4>back country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do yourself in a tent.</v>

2588
01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.250
<v Speaker 4>It's snow for five of the days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you go?</v>

2589
01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one time I went and,</v>

2590
01:49:03.651 --> 01:49:05.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of in the mountains near</v>

2591
01:49:05.301 --> 01:49:08.680
<v Speaker 4>Breckenridge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then another time I went in a</v>

2592
01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.330
<v Speaker 4>mountain range called the Santa Santa</v>
<v Speaker 4>Decristo mountains.</v>

2593
01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:14.900
<v Speaker 4>It's in the southern part of the state</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some steep shit,</v>

2594
01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:18.800
<v Speaker 4>some really gnarly stuff and hike like</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight miles back with my ultra light</v>

2595
01:49:18.801 --> 01:49:21.320
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had hunted that area with a buddy</v>

2596
01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:26.120
<v Speaker 4>of mine from home the year before and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>plan on going again and then he kicked</v>

2597
01:49:26.121 --> 01:49:27.650
<v Speaker 4>out last second because he couldn't make</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2598
01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:28.760
<v Speaker 4>So I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>screw it,</v>

2599
01:49:28.761 --> 01:49:30.140
<v Speaker 4>I got a ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got tagged,</v>

2600
01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:33.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm going by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I rented a sat phone just in case and</v>

2601
01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.760
<v Speaker 4>I went there and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the second day I walked like eight miles</v>

2602
01:49:37.761 --> 01:49:39.200
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as a bird flies,</v>

2603
01:49:39.201 --> 01:49:42.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a really long walk and uh,</v>

2604
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:43.160
<v Speaker 4>but that's where the elk were</v>

2605
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:46.440
<v Speaker 3>meaning long walk for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at what was that as the bird flies,</v>

2606
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 3>if you go in a straight line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's eight</v>

2607
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.770
<v Speaker 2>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going up and down,</v>

2608
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:51.040
<v Speaker 2>up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's way more than</v>

2609
01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:55.700
<v Speaker 4>I parked at like 8,500 feet and camped</v>
<v Speaker 4>at 10,500 feet,</v>

2610
01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.680
<v Speaker 4>which is the highest water I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>combat.</v>

2611
01:49:57.681 --> 01:49:58.490
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2612
01:49:58.490 --> 01:50:02.660
<v Speaker 4>And the elk were at like 11,500 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a lot of hiking,</v>

2613
01:50:02.661 --> 01:50:05.450
<v Speaker 4>a lot of walking and just being by</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2614
01:50:05.451 --> 01:50:07.580
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the snow component for somebody</v>

2615
01:50:07.581 --> 01:50:08.450
<v Speaker 4>from Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2616
01:50:08.451 --> 01:50:12.080
<v Speaker 4>it's like it was snowing every day and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was cooking in my tent and eating and</v>

2617
01:50:12.081 --> 01:50:15.640
<v Speaker 4>it's snowing and an elk were coming in</v>
<v Speaker 4>at night and screaming her guts out.</v>

2618
01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:17.840
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there was like a crazy,</v>

2619
01:50:17.841 --> 01:50:21.350
<v Speaker 4>like lightning storm and windstorm attic</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a pack of my tent the middle of the</v>

2620
01:50:21.351 --> 01:50:22.300
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that was going to blow over,</v>

2621
01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I thought is going to hit me out of go</v>
<v Speaker 4>into like a dense a pine forest and</v>

2622
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:28.520
<v Speaker 4>reset up my 10 mil night during a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lightning storm.</v>

2623
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:31.340
<v Speaker 4>Call my wife and I in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>night and like,</v>

2624
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:33.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let her know exactly where I was just in</v>

2625
01:50:33.441 --> 01:50:36.990
<v Speaker 4>case the shit hit the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that type of stuff is um,</v>

2626
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of barriers in that area and why</v>

2627
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:40.280
<v Speaker 4>anzalone shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2628
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:43.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those type of experience for,</v>

2629
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:44.930
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't never had those kinds of</v>

2630
01:50:44.931 --> 01:50:46.850
<v Speaker 4>experiences before I started hunting</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

2631
01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.980
<v Speaker 4>I never saw a stat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of country.</v>

2632
01:50:48.981 --> 01:50:51.350
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never put myself in those kinds of</v>

2633
01:50:51.351 --> 01:50:52.350
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2634
01:50:52.351 --> 01:50:55.330
<v Speaker 4>and until I found bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2635
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:57.680
<v Speaker 4>that's a reason I was never like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go hiking,</v>

2636
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:59.870
<v Speaker 4>not a hiker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to have like a purpose when I'm</v>

2637
01:50:59.871 --> 01:51:00.441
<v Speaker 4>hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2638
01:51:00.441 --> 01:51:05.441
<v Speaker 4>So I'm basically like a hiker with a bow</v>
<v Speaker 4>these days and that's what gets me out</v>

2639
01:51:05.511 --> 01:51:09.140
<v Speaker 4>to these kinds of places and had the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the best experiences of my life</v>

2640
01:51:09.141 --> 01:51:10.850
<v Speaker 4>just because I found bow hunting.</v>

2641
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Well those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those woods and like where you're going</v>

2642
01:51:14.841 --> 01:51:17.630
<v Speaker 2>these places where you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>run into any other people,</v>

2643
01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:20.210
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a feeling that you get from</v>

2644
01:51:20.211 --> 01:51:21.800
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those environments.</v>

2645
01:51:21.801 --> 01:51:26.000
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a loneliness in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a or almost like a.</v>

2646
01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:30.680
<v Speaker 2>it's all right because it's so beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so incredible,</v>

2647
01:51:30.681 --> 01:51:33.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's humbling and a bunch of different</v>

2648
01:51:33.651 --> 01:51:35.510
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the ways it's humbling because</v>

2649
01:51:35.511 --> 01:51:37.580
<v Speaker 2>this woods doesn't give a fuck about</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2650
01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Have you died?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2651
01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:40.160
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2652
01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Grizzlies keep fucking eating elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep having sex and screaming their</v>

2653
01:51:44.691 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 2>heads off and birds keep flying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just how we've always done it.</v>

2654
01:51:48.881 --> 01:51:49.431
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2655
01:51:49.431 --> 01:51:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2656
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.530
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2657
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:52.490
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't care.</v>

2658
01:51:52.650 --> 01:51:54.000
<v Speaker 4>And you're alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like alone,</v>

2659
01:51:54.010 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 4>alone in the dark night seems darker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2660
01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.870
<v Speaker 4>the silent seems more silent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2661
01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Way More.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2662
01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.400
<v Speaker 4>you get back to your tent and it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the big perspective enhancer?</v>

2663
01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:06.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2664
01:52:07.670 --> 01:52:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I went to Prince of Wales last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2665
01:52:09.921 --> 01:52:11.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hunted on Prince of Wales Island</v>

2666
01:52:11.630 --> 01:52:14.420
<v Speaker 2>outside of Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking rained everyday.</v>

2667
01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Just miserable every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Moose,</v>

2668
01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were hunting.</v>

2669
01:52:18.110 --> 01:52:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Deer were hunting sickle blacktail very</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2670
01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.880
<v Speaker 2>But I'm unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

2671
01:52:22.881 --> 01:52:25.180
<v Speaker 2>we struck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when we came back hard,</v>

2672
01:52:25.190 --> 01:52:26.630
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real hard.</v>

2673
01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:28.670
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them were we were,</v>

2674
01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2675
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:30.320
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fucked up.</v>

2676
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>We got to a place where they had already</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved down towards the water and we were</v>

2677
01:52:34.131 --> 01:52:36.020
<v Speaker 2>up high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you with cameras at hunt?</v>

2678
01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:37.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was with Rinella.</v>

2679
01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.420
<v Speaker 2>That was for the mediator show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things about it was that</v>

2680
01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 2>feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a sadness look,</v>

2681
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gorgeous,</v>

2682
01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:48.410
<v Speaker 3>like it would rain every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every now and then the sun would</v>

2683
01:52:48.411 --> 01:52:53.300
<v Speaker 3>come up and when the sun would come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun would hit this incredible green.</v>

2684
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:55.520
<v Speaker 3>It would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like an illuminating like this,</v>

2685
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:59.830
<v Speaker 3>like it was lit up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>

2686
01:52:59.870 --> 01:53:04.870
<v Speaker 3>we got back after seven days of this or</v>
<v Speaker 3>however many days or six days and</v>

2687
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:10.330
<v Speaker 3>everything in La seems so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was so warm and beautiful and I just</v>

2688
01:53:11.541 --> 01:53:13.780
<v Speaker 3>loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so happy and uh,</v>

2689
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I called Rinella up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2690
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever been happier in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

2691
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:21.320
<v Speaker 3>I am so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's because I was so miserable for</v>

2692
01:53:21.321 --> 01:53:24.500
<v Speaker 3>those days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that's another perspective</v>

2693
01:53:24.501 --> 01:53:27.980
<v Speaker 3>enhancer to realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so God damn lucky I have a roof</v>

2694
01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:31.520
<v Speaker 3>overhead and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can listen to the radio in your car</v>

2695
01:53:31.521 --> 01:53:32.750
<v Speaker 3>and then you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2696
01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:37.430
<v Speaker 3>you can get around and it's easy and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could talk to be blowing your phone when</v>

2697
01:53:37.431 --> 01:53:38.840
<v Speaker 3>you're out in the woods.</v>

2698
01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no cell phone service,</v>

2699
01:53:41.031 --> 01:53:42.740
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

2700
01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:46.710
<v Speaker 3>We have Amazon packages come into your</v>
<v Speaker 3>house and like food delivery and</v>

2701
01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.590
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Pizza.</v>

2702
01:53:48.591 --> 01:53:50.660
<v Speaker 3>You can order pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's fucking nothing,</v>

2703
01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:52.700
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We brought some food with us and that is</v>

2704
01:53:52.701 --> 01:53:57.340
<v Speaker 3>what we ate because we struck out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cold and the wet,</v>

2705
01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:02.240
<v Speaker 3>the wet</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you've been head to toe soaking</v>

2706
01:54:02.241 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 3>wet and your boots and your socks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pants and your rain gear and</v>

2707
01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:08.810
<v Speaker 3>everything is everything that's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep you warm and safe from the</v>

2708
01:54:08.811 --> 01:54:12.410
<v Speaker 3>elements is soaked to the bone and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting cold.</v>

2709
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.520
<v Speaker 3>That's gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2710
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 3>that's also where you appreciate really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good gear to Merino wool.</v>

2711
01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2712
01:54:18.531 --> 01:54:23.531
<v Speaker 3>a will is a weird cloth in that like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have cotton on and you get wet,</v>

2713
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:28.130
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you have wool on and you get wet,</v>

2714
01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.360
<v Speaker 3>the wool actually retains the heat so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be wet and still warm,</v>

2715
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 3>which is really unusual and hard for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to understand.</v>

2716
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:39.560
<v Speaker 3>If you've never worn wool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's when you know what I mean.</v>

2717
01:54:40.150 --> 01:54:43.580
<v Speaker 3>The the right gear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know as a lot of hunts that really</v>

2718
01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.670
<v Speaker 3>you don't really need the right gear for</v>
<v Speaker 3>printing,</v>

2719
01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:49.550
<v Speaker 3>but in that back country stuff or real</v>
<v Speaker 3>steep mountains or stuff where you have</v>

2720
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:52.490
<v Speaker 3>to walk far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your shoes are wet and your socks are</v>

2721
01:54:52.491 --> 01:54:53.810
<v Speaker 3>wet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have an earliest</v>

2722
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:55.880
<v Speaker 3>blisters and you won't be able to walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>

2723
01:54:55.990 --> 01:55:00.440
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm really fascinated by</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies like cool you that spend all</v>

2724
01:55:00.441 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 3>this time developing the most technical</v>
<v Speaker 3>gear,</v>

2725
01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:08.270
<v Speaker 3>like the lightest weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best at absorbing wind for their</v>

2726
01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:09.920
<v Speaker 3>tents and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2727
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:13.970
<v Speaker 3>they'd go through great lengths to</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineer their products to make sure</v>

2728
01:55:13.971 --> 01:55:16.730
<v Speaker 3>that it's just mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant company that just makes</v>

2729
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:18.470
<v Speaker 3>ultra light gear for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2730
01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:21.050
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>company like that.</v>

2731
01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2732
01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.800
<v Speaker 3>you can see why when you go in the back</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

2733
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:25.990
<v Speaker 3>don't have the right gear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2734
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:29.030
<v Speaker 3>that's the last kind of hunting you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do like that and how it's like</v>

2735
01:55:29.031 --> 01:55:31.610
<v Speaker 3>a survival thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you figure out like what stuff to</v>

2736
01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:34.710
<v Speaker 3>bring and what stuff not to bring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you read up or did you do trial and</v>

2737
01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:35.563
<v Speaker 3>error?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2738
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2739
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 3>right when I got into bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

2740
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:43.440
<v Speaker 3>I got bored of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of feeding pigs and have want to come to</v>

2741
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:44.160
<v Speaker 3>my house</v>

2742
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having them come to my trees down.</v>

2743
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I got bored of that pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Super Fun at first and I loved it</v>

2744
01:55:50.251 --> 01:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>and it was a really good learning and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a blast.</v>

2745
01:55:54.001 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's building tree stands by myself,</v>

2746
01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.290
<v Speaker 1>but I what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I super quickly got bored of that and</v>

2747
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:00.480
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go walk in the mountains all</v>

2748
01:56:00.481 --> 01:56:04.380
<v Speaker 1>day long and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ordered Cameron Hanes is back country</v>

2749
01:56:04.381 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is right when I started hunting,</v>

2750
01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea who cameron hanes was and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was geeking out on everything.</v>

2751
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Hunting and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some research,</v>

2752
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:15.690
<v Speaker 1>found that book ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed my life.</v>

2753
01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny because I told Cameron</v>

2754
01:56:18.631 --> 01:56:20.680
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2755
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:21.643
<v Speaker 1>I told them that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2756
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:24.210
<v Speaker 1>that I got his book and it like fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired me.</v>

2757
01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.553
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2758
01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I ordered like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultralight tent,</v>

2759
01:56:28.291 --> 01:56:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the right one to all this research on</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one to get which one is lightest,</v>

2760
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:34.380
<v Speaker 1>which one's the driest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one is the best at cooking,</v>

2761
01:56:34.381 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 1>which is that the biggest vestibule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ordered the right,</v>

2762
01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the right stove and all the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2763
01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:44.700
<v Speaker 1>ultra light plates and forks and caps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp cups and a sleeping bags and tout</v>

2764
01:56:48.230 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little talent packs up tiny on the</v>

2765
01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 1>pillow that packs of tiny in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack and all that stuff.</v>

2766
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:55.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's funny because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2767
01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:58.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're shading ounces and it really</v>

2768
01:56:58.441 --> 01:56:59.250
<v Speaker 1>adds up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:01.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like a difference between like 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound pack and a 40 pound pack when you</v>

2770
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.360
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get the right gear.</v>

2771
01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Jason Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the owner,</v>

2772
01:57:05.490 --> 01:57:07.300
<v Speaker 3>if he makes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2773
01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:12.270
<v Speaker 3>a spreadsheet where he ways every single</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing he's,</v>

2774
01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:17.540
<v Speaker 3>he's bringing and he packs it up and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>weighs like what's in each pack and what</v>

2775
01:57:18.361 --> 01:57:23.220
<v Speaker 3>he needs for each and he has this like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this excel spreadsheet of all the</v>

2776
01:57:23.221 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 3>different stuff and then that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously people take it.</v>

2777
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Especially like sheep hunting and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>on those lines.</v>

2778
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:31.440
<v Speaker 3>I got so geeked out on the ultralight</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that I started like looking at all</v>

2779
01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:32.340
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>

2780
01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:36.450
<v Speaker 3>like ultra light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra light hiking websites and like</v>

2781
01:57:36.451 --> 01:57:36.840
<v Speaker 3>getting all it</v>

2782
01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:37.830
<v Speaker 1>tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2783
01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:40.460
<v Speaker 1>like instead of just bringing in like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little spark,</v>

2784
01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those like little sport,</v>

2785
01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:46.440
<v Speaker 1>the ultralight sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd cut your fork in half or even like</v>

2786
01:57:46.670 --> 01:57:48.750
<v Speaker 1>in just one third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just had the fork,</v>

2787
01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 1>just a fork part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you'd,</v>

2788
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd shave off those ounces of the rest</v>

2789
01:57:53.611 --> 01:57:55.920
<v Speaker 1>of the fork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just be the part where you just ate,</v>

2790
01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:56.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2791
01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:58.950
<v Speaker 1>and your toothbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cut it.</v>

2792
01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So it was just the part that goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't your</v>

2793
01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:01.350
<v Speaker 3>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2794
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 3>that's what Adam does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me he does that pretty</v>

2795
01:58:03.691 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but plus I'm a manly man.</v>

2796
01:58:06.361 --> 01:58:09.990
<v Speaker 3>I can carry a toothbrush handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny though because it all adds up</v>

2797
01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know you don't think you need</v>

2798
01:58:11.671 --> 01:58:13.050
<v Speaker 3>that much stuff to go in the back</v>
<v Speaker 3>country hunt,</v>

2799
01:58:13.051 --> 01:58:16.590
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times you put every single</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you're going to put in that pack</v>

2800
01:58:16.591 --> 01:58:17.980
<v Speaker 3>and it's a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2801
01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:20.610
<v Speaker 3>And to share those out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this down means then you can bring like</v>

2802
01:58:20.611 --> 01:58:22.950
<v Speaker 3>a better 10 better sleeping bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2803
01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:24.870
<v Speaker 3>You add up some more ounces on the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2804
01:58:24.871 --> 01:58:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big eater so I'll bring a lot of</v>

2805
01:58:27.121 --> 01:58:32.121
<v Speaker 3>food and water and you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now do you weigh out your food?</v>

2806
01:58:32.191 --> 01:58:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you make sure that you have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense calorie dense food?</v>

2807
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of stuff do you bring with you</v>

2808
01:58:38.191 --> 01:58:40.860
<v Speaker 3>when you go on a back country hunt of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2809
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 3>stuff you get bored of quick.</v>

2810
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 4>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bring like nuts,</v>

2811
01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:50.580
<v Speaker 4>like macadamia nuts and almonds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pecans and cheese and jerky and stuff</v>

2812
01:58:52.181 --> 01:58:53.180
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they're,</v>

2813
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:55.060
<v Speaker 4>especially if there's water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a game changer.</v>

2814
01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:56.740
<v Speaker 4>If there's water where you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

2815
01:58:56.741 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 4>or even anywhere near where you going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be that are bringing stove every time</v>

2816
01:58:59.891 --> 01:59:02.800
<v Speaker 4>with oatmeal and freeze dried meals like</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain house meals,</v>

2817
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.220
<v Speaker 4>those are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to try a dehydrated.</v>

2818
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the same ones.</v>

2819
01:59:08.170 --> 01:59:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a freeze dried.</v>

2820
01:59:10.581 --> 01:59:14.710
<v Speaker 4>The dehydrated is apparently lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why people are gravitating</v>

2821
01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 4>towards dehydrated now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

2822
01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't own a house there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So light.</v>

2823
01:59:18.641 --> 01:59:21.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how anyone can be lighter</v>
<v Speaker 4>than that while you're shaving the</v>

2824
01:59:21.281 --> 01:59:22.840
<v Speaker 4>handle of your toothbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2825
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.080
<v Speaker 4>The best space to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2826
01:59:25.170 --> 01:59:26.740
<v Speaker 4>I think that is what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2827
01:59:26.741 --> 01:59:29.710
<v Speaker 4>That takes up less space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's certain certain things that</v>

2828
01:59:29.711 --> 01:59:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I can't skimp on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like food.</v>

2829
01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.321
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2830
01:59:32.321 --> 01:59:35.380
<v Speaker 4>what's really good is when you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I do hunt like that,</v>

2831
01:59:35.381 --> 01:59:40.381
<v Speaker 4>I'll make like two handfuls of Bacon and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll make it all up and then I'll bring</v>

2832
01:59:40.991 --> 01:59:42.850
<v Speaker 4>that and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my treat at lunch.</v>

2833
01:59:42.851 --> 01:59:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I'll have a couple pieces of bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it go bad?</v>

2834
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:46.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it Kinda doesn't.</v>

2835
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:48.810
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once,</v>

2836
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 4>once you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you cook it,</v>

2837
01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.240
<v Speaker 4>it depends where you hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

2838
01:59:52.241 --> 01:59:55.170
<v Speaker 4>if you're hunting and in Arizona in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>summer,</v>

2839
01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 4>then maybe a or somewhere by the beach</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii probably go bad,</v>

2840
01:59:58.601 --> 02:00:02.030
<v Speaker 4>but a normal hunt if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your stuff doesn't get super hot and</v>

2841
02:00:02.031 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 4>all was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long has cooked Bacon last?</v>

2842
02:00:04.690 --> 02:00:06.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got that idea I think from Karen and</v>

2843
02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:09.280
<v Speaker 4>his book because he would make peanut</v>
<v Speaker 4>butter and jelly sandwiches with Bacon</v>

2844
02:00:09.281 --> 02:00:10.220
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2845
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:12.190
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I would do that.</v>

2846
02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:14.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how long it lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't tell me if it's.</v>

2847
02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:16.300
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bring it for like a five day hunt.</v>

2848
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:18.430
<v Speaker 4>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just thinking at least the first</v>

2849
02:00:18.431 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 4>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you start getting diarrhea then you</v>

2850
02:00:20.381 --> 02:00:21.760
<v Speaker 4>cut back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2851
02:00:22.190 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2852
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:24.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was I going to say?</v>

2853
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know.</v>

2854
02:00:26.531 --> 02:00:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I just craved the fats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm eating,</v>

2855
02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:31.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating all these nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bars,</v>

2856
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:32.800
<v Speaker 4>nuts in bars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuts and bars,</v>

2857
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:35.380
<v Speaker 4>not bars and all I want is fat like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greece.</v>

2858
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 4>But when you're doing heavy duty</v>
<v Speaker 4>climbing and things along those lines</v>

2859
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 4>are going up and down mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is what you crave.</v>

2860
02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not in the carbohydrates,</v>

2861
02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:45.970
<v Speaker 4>fats your body go like we need</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2862
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Coward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dance.</v>

2863
02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when I,</v>

2864
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:50.830
<v Speaker 4>when I leave hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I leave the mountains,</v>

2865
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:55.450
<v Speaker 4>like say I go to Colorado and I hunt for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a week and I'm like I lose 10 pounds,</v>

2866
02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:58.360
<v Speaker 4>get super skinny and like mountain man</v>
<v Speaker 4>style,</v>

2867
02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I get out of there and I just want like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bacon double cheeseburger,</v>

2868
02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:03.670
<v Speaker 4>like a big giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like the kind of the fast food</v>

2869
02:01:03.671 --> 02:01:04.570
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like a big,</v>

2870
02:01:04.571 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 4>like 30 pound Burger with a ton of Bacon</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it with like blue cheese and Avocados</v>

2871
02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:08.880
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

2872
02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a massive fat go giant and just</v>

2873
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:14.560
<v Speaker 4>blow my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blow my self sky high with a giant thing</v>

2874
02:01:14.561 --> 02:01:18.070
<v Speaker 4>of fries and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's always what I created with the</v>

2875
02:01:18.071 --> 02:01:20.530
<v Speaker 4>amount of calories that you're burning</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're climbing up and down</v>

2876
02:01:20.531 --> 02:01:22.060
<v Speaker 4>mountains all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

2877
02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:26.410
<v Speaker 4>And it's thousands of calories a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You literally have to keep stuffing your</v>

2878
02:01:26.411 --> 02:01:28.990
<v Speaker 4>face just to maintain your body mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2879
02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2880
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 4>if you are a person who is doing this on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a regular basis,</v>

2881
02:01:35.590 --> 02:01:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean you would get really good at</v>
<v Speaker 4>preparing for these things,</v>

2882
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 4>so you must have</v>

2883
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:45.470
<v Speaker 2>undergone a transformation where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>started off sort of kind of like trying</v>

2884
02:01:45.471 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 2>to figure it out and then as you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and better and better,</v>

2885
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>you got more and more streamlined in you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your approach.</v>

2886
02:01:51.970 --> 02:01:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Like do you feel like you have it down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a science now?</v>

2887
02:01:54.321 --> 02:01:57.470
<v Speaker 2>If you want to do something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what the actual backcountry hunt or</v>

2888
02:01:57.471 --> 02:01:59.240
<v Speaker 2>the actual hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the old stuff.</v>

2889
02:01:59.241 --> 02:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>You're packing your plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever use Google maps?</v>

2890
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty cool that you can do a</v>

2891
02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 2>phone these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2892
02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:09.620
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would people do if you don't know</v>

2893
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:13.060
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find an area like say if you draw a</v>

2894
02:02:13.061 --> 02:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>tag for an area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd get her over.</v>

2895
02:02:14.991 --> 02:02:16.420
<v Speaker 2>This is not for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>

2896
02:02:16.421 --> 02:02:17.254
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

2897
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:20.690
<v Speaker 2>but you get an overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google earth will give you.</v>

2898
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It'll show you where the peaks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>valleys are and it's amazing.</v>

2899
02:02:24.651 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It shows you the canyons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows you water sources and you see</v>

2900
02:02:28.011 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>from a satellite image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can literally see elk sometimes</v>

2901
02:02:32.331 --> 02:02:34.250
<v Speaker 2>on Google Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is incredible.</v>

2902
02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can really like,</v>

2903
02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:37.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get back to your camp much more,</v>

2904
02:02:37.890 --> 02:02:39.690
<v Speaker 4>much quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of time,</v>

2905
02:02:39.730 --> 02:02:41.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get lost in a dark,</v>

2906
02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:43.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get to your water source wave</v>

2907
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:46.140
<v Speaker 4>way quicker and it's really efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you need to bring batteries to</v>

2908
02:02:46.890 --> 02:02:48.480
<v Speaker 4>for your phone or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2909
02:02:48.590 --> 02:02:51.330
<v Speaker 4>know some solar panel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't really found a super</v>

2910
02:02:51.331 --> 02:02:53.820
<v Speaker 4>efficient solar panel that'll charge up</v>
<v Speaker 4>your phone in here.</v>

2911
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Stuff that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2912
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting a lot of sunlight.</v>

2913
02:02:57.861 --> 02:03:00.230
<v Speaker 2>There always seems like it doesn't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>as good as you hope.</v>

2914
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting better at those things</v>

2915
02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.790
<v Speaker 2>they're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're in Arizona,</v>

2916
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:06.420
<v Speaker 2>know when you're in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2917
02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>mule deer hunting in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a great shot at charging a</v>

2918
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.941
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave it.</v>

2919
02:03:10.941 --> 02:03:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2920
02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.580
<v Speaker 4>One place for like a few hours just</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there in the sun.</v>

2921
02:03:13.581 --> 02:03:14.414
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2922
02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 4>But as far as the hunting goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have gotten better at the</v>

2923
02:03:18.471 --> 02:03:20.450
<v Speaker 4>planning and the and the back country</v>
<v Speaker 4>gear,</v>

2924
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:23.450
<v Speaker 4>but that's all I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you learn that pretty quick,</v>

2925
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:27.290
<v Speaker 4>but you found out you find out if your</v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty hunter right away because you</v>

2926
02:03:27.291 --> 02:03:28.580
<v Speaker 4>come home with no meat all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2927
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's very easy.</v>

2928
02:03:30.111 --> 02:03:32.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's like finding out if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're good at the stock market,</v>

2929
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.160
<v Speaker 4>you know right away you get that</v>
<v Speaker 4>feedback,</v>

2930
02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:36.300
<v Speaker 4>you lose a bunch of money all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2931
02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:39.830
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing with bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love going hunting because I didn't</v>

2932
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:42.260
<v Speaker 4>grow up in a hunting family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no background in it when I was</v>

2933
02:03:42.261 --> 02:03:43.990
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't have like those,</v>

2934
02:03:43.991 --> 02:03:47.040
<v Speaker 4>like the instincts like that someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have like that.</v>

2935
02:03:47.250 --> 02:03:50.750
<v Speaker 4>I've really good friends that grew up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a bow in their hand and their dad</v>

2936

<v Speaker 4>GRANDPA did actually one family in</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>

2938

<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

2952
02:04:31.981 --> 02:04:35.370
<v Speaker 4>I learned how to shoot terribly and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to relearn ever since I've been</v>

2953

<v Speaker 4>my effective range is still like 50</v>

2957
02:04:48.121 --> 02:04:50.610
<v Speaker 4>yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried for a long time.</v>

2958
02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 4>Thirteen years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2959
02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:54.300
<v Speaker 4>That's tried really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You when you practice,</v>

2960
02:04:54.301 --> 02:04:57.510
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel a targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can kill a target at 70.</v>

2961
02:04:57.870 --> 02:04:59.850
<v Speaker 4>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's so different,</v>

2962
02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:02.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like guys I can say that they to shoot</v>

2963
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:05.730
<v Speaker 4>60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be shooting 122 to be able to</v>

2964
02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:08.010
<v Speaker 4>be effective at 60.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should be shooting hundred 20 because of</v>

2965
02:05:08.011 --> 02:05:09.930
<v Speaker 4>the pressure of the nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2966
02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:13.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference between a target</v>
<v Speaker 4>and an animal just so totally different.</v>

2967
02:05:13.230 --> 02:05:15.270
<v Speaker 4>So it was also the way you shoot too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2968
02:05:15.271 --> 02:05:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Do you use a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a trigger or using these?</v>

2969
02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:21.320
<v Speaker 4>A thumb release.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you usually use a lot of attention</v>

2970
02:05:21.590 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 4>and what kind of release you using?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got target panic if you ever heard of</v>

2971
02:05:24.571 --> 02:05:25.404
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2972
02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I asked you socks.</v>

2973
02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.200
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to not want to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2974
02:05:30.670 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hunted for years and then recently my</v>

2975
02:05:33.661 --> 02:05:37.920
<v Speaker 4>friend was filming and as I would shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would punch a trigger like crazy and I</v>

2976
02:05:37.921 --> 02:05:40.920
<v Speaker 4>didn't even realize I was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got worse and worse to the point</v>

2977
02:05:40.921 --> 02:05:45.510
<v Speaker 4>where I ended up giving my releases away</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stop hunting for about four months.</v>

2978
02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:48.600
<v Speaker 4>And all I did was go and shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put this target right outside my front</v>

2979
02:05:48.601 --> 02:05:50.850
<v Speaker 4>door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hanging bag target and I would,</v>

2980
02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:54.810
<v Speaker 4>I'd walk up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>draw my bow like a one foot away from it</v>

2981
02:05:54.811 --> 02:05:57.990
<v Speaker 4>and just practice releasing over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over with your eyes closed than</v>

2982
02:05:57.991 --> 02:06:01.500
<v Speaker 4>my eyes closed so I wouldn't focus on</v>
<v Speaker 4>any aiming or anything.</v>

2983
02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:04.620
<v Speaker 4>It was like a psychology thing where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to break down your break it down.</v>

2984
02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.780
<v Speaker 4>We came down into like the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>release.</v>

2985
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's called blind bail shooting for</v>

2986
02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 4>people don't know what it is is impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bracing your.</v>

2987
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Your mind gets used to the feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bomb going off and so you brace for</v>

2988
02:06:16.921 --> 02:06:20.910
<v Speaker 4>it and when you do that you start to</v>
<v Speaker 4>develop these sorts of patterns where</v>

2989
02:06:20.911 --> 02:06:23.700
<v Speaker 4>you're anticipating the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy and it can really fuck your</v>

2990
02:06:23.701 --> 02:06:27.750
<v Speaker 4>head up really can and I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got so bad to where I couldn't put my</v>

2991
02:06:27.751 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 4>pin on the animal and my finger on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger without punching it.</v>

2992
02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to put my finger,</v>

2993
02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:35.450
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2994
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:39.320
<v Speaker 4>my pin off the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then my finger on the trigger and</v>

2995
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 4>then got extreme and then once the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger or what's the pin is near the</v>

2996
02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

2997
02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Then you just hit it early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nervous.</v>

2998
02:06:45.301 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really bizarre.</v>

2999
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:49.920
<v Speaker 4>And this is weird because you're such A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3000
02:06:49.921 --> 02:06:53.820
<v Speaker 4>you're a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with giant waves and</v>

3001
02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:54.801
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3002
02:06:54.801 --> 02:06:57.540
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking surfing 50 foot high</v>
<v Speaker 4>waves.</v>

3003
02:06:57.541 --> 02:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>If someone told me that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to me,</v>

3004
02:06:59.221 --> 02:07:01.650
<v Speaker 4>I would've just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've bet my life savings against</v>

3005
02:07:01.651 --> 02:07:03.990
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally not that guy like freaks out</v>

3006
02:07:03.991 --> 02:07:06.060
<v Speaker 4>and gets panicked out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff like that.</v>

3007
02:07:06.061 --> 02:07:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Especially like a pin on a boat like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3008
02:07:08.101 --> 02:07:09.460
<v Speaker 4>like break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3009
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:12.330
<v Speaker 4>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to work through it for a little</v>

3010
02:07:12.331 --> 02:07:12.780
<v Speaker 4>while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3011
02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:14.750
<v Speaker 4>there's people who like give up archery</v>
<v Speaker 4>all together.</v>

3012
02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super common.</v>

3013
02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:17.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:07:17.110 --> 02:07:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I read a lot about it.</v>

3015
02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrified of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3016
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Don't even worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just just do your thing and keep hunting</v>

3017
02:07:23.401 --> 02:07:25.860
<v Speaker 4>and what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've learned how to shoot with back</v>

3018
02:07:25.861 --> 02:07:27.620
<v Speaker 4>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I get a surprise shot.</v>

3019
02:07:27.621 --> 02:07:28.650
<v Speaker 4>It's all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3020

<v Speaker 4>but cam diseases triggers.</v>

3021
02:07:31.621 --> 02:07:33.480

<v Speaker 3>tension,</v>

3026
02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:43.390
<v Speaker 3>is something you got from youtube videos</v>
<v Speaker 3>or did you have someone show you how to</v>

3027

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3028
02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.320

02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I've a really good friend from Spain.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3033
02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:55.150
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a few of them in Spanish.</v>

3034
02:07:55.170 --> 02:07:57.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what I heard a few Pedro's down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3037
02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:05.000
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he suggested,</v>

3038
02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a back tension release.</v>

3039
02:08:06.521 --> 02:08:09.120
<v Speaker 3>And let me explain what works for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have no idea what we're talking</v>

3040
02:08:09.121 --> 02:08:10.210
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3041
02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:13.500
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a type of release that has,</v>

3042
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:16.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you sort of set your stem on it,</v>

3043
02:08:16.651 --> 02:08:18.420
<v Speaker 3>but you don't squeeze it with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>thumb,</v>

3044
02:08:18.630 --> 02:08:19.081
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

3045
02:08:19.081 --> 02:08:21.180
<v Speaker 3>is you need to know what I release it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3046
02:08:21.210 --> 02:08:23.970
<v Speaker 3>It's something that connects to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>string on your bow.</v>

3047
02:08:23.971 --> 02:08:26.040
<v Speaker 3>It actually connects to what's called a</v>
<v Speaker 3>d loop,</v>

3048
02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:27.630
<v Speaker 3>which connects to the string.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

3049
02:08:27.631 --> 02:08:29.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well those are back tension releases</v>

3050
02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:33.930
<v Speaker 3>where those are like real back tension</v>
<v Speaker 3>release where very few people ever use</v>

3051
02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:36.180
<v Speaker 3>those for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I like what,</v>

3052
02:08:36.210 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 3>what kind of release you use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what brand is?</v>

3053
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a Carter release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3054
02:08:40.050 --> 02:08:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use a carter,</v>

3055
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:43.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's mainly back tension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll like,</v>

3056
02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll put my thumb around the</v>

3057
02:08:46.381 --> 02:08:48.660
<v Speaker 3>trigger and then I'll just keep pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>until it goes off.</v>

3058
02:08:49.050 --> 02:08:51.540
<v Speaker 3>It goes off when you never know when</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going off.</v>

3059
02:08:51.541 --> 02:08:54.630
<v Speaker 3>So because of that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>anticipating but in a,</v>

3060
02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.970
<v Speaker 3>in a it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it keeps coming back like in a,</v>

3061
02:08:57.110 --> 02:09:01.400
<v Speaker 3>in a situation where I'm hunting when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 25 yards and I'm getting full drawn</v>

3062
02:09:01.401 --> 02:09:02.100
<v Speaker 3>and deer</v>

3063
02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:05.130
<v Speaker 4>and it's perfectly broadside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this overwhelming feeling like it</v>

3064
02:09:05.131 --> 02:09:08.820
<v Speaker 4>wants to move and I'll then now I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sorta like trained myself to like</v>

3065
02:09:08.821 --> 02:09:12.440
<v Speaker 4>slowly squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>squeeze and pull so that</v>

3066
02:09:12.490 --> 02:09:15.280
<v Speaker 3>it makes it go quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say you should have like a mantra</v>

3067
02:09:15.450 --> 02:09:18.370
<v Speaker 3>as in your head as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you should have a bunch of things</v>

3068
02:09:18.371 --> 02:09:21.670
<v Speaker 3>that you say like line it up and release</v>
<v Speaker 3>the air like that.</v>

3069
02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:25.300
<v Speaker 3>You have to have like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you put in your head and you</v>

3070
02:09:25.301 --> 02:09:27.130
<v Speaker 3>probably wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't say release the Arrow.</v>

3071
02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:28.810
<v Speaker 3>What's yours?</v>

3075
02:09:32.291 --> 02:09:33.124

<v Speaker 4>Execute the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:37.480
<v Speaker 3>stay calm too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other one.</v>

3079
02:09:37.481 --> 02:09:39.880
<v Speaker 3>I say stay calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breathe.</v>

3080
02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:41.283
<v Speaker 3>Breathe.</v>

3081
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do that thing where I,</v>

3082
02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:49.700
<v Speaker 4>I spell lock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Loc K as I'm settling,</v>

3083
02:09:49.701 --> 02:09:50.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to full draw.</v>

3084
02:09:50.730 --> 02:09:51.710
<v Speaker 4>Get my anchor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3085
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start settling the pin and I look at</v>

3086
02:09:54.711 --> 02:09:55.440
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

3087
02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.720
<v Speaker 4>my bubble level and once my little</v>
<v Speaker 4>checklist is online and I'm on the</v>

3088
02:09:59.721 --> 02:10:01.780
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as I feel like my,</v>

3089
02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:06.880
<v Speaker 4>my pin starts to relax and steady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spelled the word lock and squeezes the</v>

3090
02:10:07.941 --> 02:10:08.700
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

3091
02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.070
<v Speaker 4>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might steal that.</v>

3092
02:10:10.330 --> 02:10:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what else you're going to like.</v>

3093
02:10:11.691 --> 02:10:15.440
<v Speaker 4>This is my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Jeff who basically taught me</v>

3094
02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.840
<v Speaker 4>how to bow hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Jeff Lee.</v>

3095
02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:18.793
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Legend.</v>

3096
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:20.550
<v Speaker 4>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3097
02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:23.930
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he told me that when he is a full draw</v>

3098
02:10:23.931 --> 02:10:25.850
<v Speaker 4>right before he pulls the trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

3099
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.860
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna die motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3100
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:29.140
<v Speaker 4>that's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3101
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:30.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I liked that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he told me,</v>

3102
02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:33.080
<v Speaker 4>but he's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not like that.</v>

3103
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Like you would never think</v>

3104
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:35.083
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like,</v>

3105
02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.570
<v Speaker 3>he's totally not blood thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a super ethical hunter.</v>

3106
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:39.501
<v Speaker 3>He just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3107
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:41.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a psychological thing.</v>

3108
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:44.630
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are hoping you're going to hit</v>

3109
02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:45.790
<v Speaker 3>that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that release,</v>

3110
02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 3>when that Arrow goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're hoping you're not going to hit</v>

3111
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:49.874
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to kill him.</v>

3112
02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:51.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be an efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical,</v>

3113
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:53.360
<v Speaker 3>ethical shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he goes,</v>

3114
02:10:53.361 --> 02:10:57.200
<v Speaker 3>if you truly believe that you're there</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill that animal and that animal is</v>

3115
02:10:57.201 --> 02:11:00.740
<v Speaker 3>going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right then that's a huge piece of the</v>

3116
02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:04.220
<v Speaker 3>puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a website called iron mind</v>

3117
02:11:04.221 --> 02:11:05.560
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of this?</v>

3118
02:11:05.970 --> 02:11:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Scott?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think I forget his name,</v>

3119
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Joel something or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

3120
02:11:10.401 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he suffered through target panic himself</v>

3121
02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:17.831
<v Speaker 3>and he's a swat guy and a police officer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and developed a whole system</v>

3122
02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:22.220
<v Speaker 3>understanding the impact bracing and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole system that I haven't,</v>

3123
02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I haven't read it.</v>

3124
02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:24.710
<v Speaker 3>He's got a book on it and he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

3125
02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got Joel Turner and he's got a</v>

3126
02:11:28.251 --> 02:11:31.970
<v Speaker 3>whole website dedicated to controlling</v>
<v Speaker 3>target,</v>

3127
02:11:31.971 --> 02:11:34.160
<v Speaker 3>panic and develop a whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3128
02:11:34.161 --> 02:11:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I have to check it out too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of those things where,</v>

3129
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:39.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how long you been doing it,</v>

3130
02:11:39.770 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that this shit could creep</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your brain,</v>

3131
02:11:42.231 --> 02:11:46.010
<v Speaker 3>which is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people have been successful hunting</v>

3132
02:11:46.011 --> 02:11:48.950
<v Speaker 3>for years and years and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden they get target panic and they're</v>

3133
02:11:48.951 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody you meet who's bow</v>

3134
02:11:52.821 --> 02:11:56.090
<v Speaker 3>hunted for a couple of decades has had</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost everybody.</v>

3135
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Everybody from randy elmer to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to everybody.</v>

3136
02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Randy Alma has a couple of good videos</v>

3137
02:12:00.741 --> 02:12:02.800
<v Speaker 3>on how to handle it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

3138
02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:07.040
<v Speaker 3>he says you should use a back tension</v>
<v Speaker 3>release to get used to it and a or a</v>

3139
02:12:07.041 --> 02:12:07.790
<v Speaker 3>hinge release.</v>

3140
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:10.370
<v Speaker 3>And what that is for the people don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what we're talking about.</v>

3141
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:13.310
<v Speaker 3>There's another type of release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a trigger at all.</v>

3142
02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:17.120
<v Speaker 3>And what you do is you draw back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just by moving your hand,</v>

3143
02:12:17.121 --> 02:12:20.240
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of curling your pinky down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and making a fist.</v>

3144
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>It goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you never know when it's going off,</v>

3145
02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.880
<v Speaker 3>it goes off completely unanticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that helps you deal with this,</v>

3146
02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.480
<v Speaker 3>this tension issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3147
02:12:30.481 --> 02:12:32.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking mind.</v>

3148
02:12:32.890 --> 02:12:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I got over the hump and I'm back.</v>

3149
02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:38.600
<v Speaker 3>You're back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a good 2016 so far.</v>

3150
02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feels good,</v>

3151
02:12:40.011 --> 02:12:40.844
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3152
02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels good.</v>

3153
02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:47.150
<v Speaker 3>As I was panicking about the panic for</v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile and this year started off good.</v>

3154
02:12:47.151 --> 02:12:48.830
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done quite a bit of hunting.</v>

3155
02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:49.701
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3156
02:12:49.701 --> 02:12:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I went hunting for fallow deer with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

3157
02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:53.330
<v Speaker 3>with Remy and New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had a,</v>

3158
02:12:53.331 --> 02:12:54.560
<v Speaker 3>just an absolute ball.</v>

3159
02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Killed a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great book.</v>

3160
02:12:56.990 --> 02:13:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I saw some pictures of the terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're using that crazy equivalent thing</v>

3161
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:01.101
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3162
02:13:01.101 --> 02:13:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Where it's a stabilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I tried that for awhile,</v>

3163
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:05.480
<v Speaker 3>but it kept getting loose on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3164
02:13:05.481 --> 02:13:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was wiggling around too much.</v>

3165
02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have that problem writing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>down too much and it worked really good</v>

3166
02:13:10.371 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 3>for that hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that specific hunt.</v>

3167
02:13:11.811 --> 02:13:15.770
<v Speaker 3>But we wanted in this awesome terrain</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this crazy rocks and cliffs.</v>

3168
02:13:15.771 --> 02:13:18.130
<v Speaker 3>There was not one Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no bushes there.</v>

3169
02:13:18.150 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 3>There's no trees in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like you had to use the,</v>

3170
02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:23.210
<v Speaker 3>you had to use the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3171
02:13:23.211 --> 02:13:25.670
<v Speaker 3>the rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rocky outcroppings,</v>

3172
02:13:25.671 --> 02:13:29.600
<v Speaker 3>and just the basic like terrain features</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get close and we ended up sneaking</v>

3173
02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>down on this bed of group of deer that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was at the base of this</v>

3174
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.700
<v Speaker 4>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go Get up.</v>

3175
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:34.481
<v Speaker 4>Go to Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3176
02:13:34.481 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 4>Brian's a instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is instagram?</v>

3177
02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:41.970
<v Speaker 4>A steep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was such a steep downhill shot that I</v>

3178
02:13:41.971 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 4>had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3179
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:45.360
<v Speaker 4>when you're shooting down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to you gotta bend at the waist,</v>

3180
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:50.130
<v Speaker 4>you can just aim down miss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I had to remember all that stuff</v>

3181
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:52.200
<v Speaker 4>in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a really technical shot and</v>

3182
02:13:52.201 --> 02:13:54.060
<v Speaker 4>a technical stock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really a lot of fun.</v>

3183
02:13:54.090 --> 02:13:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ben took a photo.</v>

3184
02:13:55.111 --> 02:13:58.740
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I said go to Ben's</v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram because he took a Benny Aubrey</v>

3187
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:06.660
<v Speaker 4>looks like you're shooting from the top</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a building.</v>

3188
02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:08.220

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3191
02:14:10.471 --> 02:14:11.850
<v Speaker 4>And that's the kind of,</v>

3192
02:14:11.851 --> 02:14:13.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>practice that you'd never do.</v>

3193
02:14:13.770 --> 02:14:16.890
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people don't like set their</v>
<v Speaker 4>target the bottom of a cliff and stand</v>

3194
02:14:16.891 --> 02:14:20.310
<v Speaker 4>at the top and it's really different or</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting up either.</v>

02:14:20.330 --> 02:14:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either one of the super different type</v>

3196
02:14:21.881 --> 02:14:22.800
<v Speaker 4>of shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

<v Speaker 4>some really good hunts.</v>

<v Speaker 4>eastern Australia.</v>

3203
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was a ball.</v>

3204

<v Speaker 4>We had a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of fun.</v>

<v Speaker 4>at a big valley or over the ocean in</v>

3213
02:15:03.631 --> 02:15:05.610
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can see the ocean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes in a swamp and snake and</v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes and slugs and spiders.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like I turned it a little pussy</v>

3220
02:15:30.331 --> 02:15:31.520
<v Speaker 4>when I come to those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

3221
02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.540
<v Speaker 4>I turn it a little pussy when I look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures of it.</v>

3222
02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:34.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3223
02:15:34.201 --> 02:15:35.450
<v Speaker 4>you gotta come to the buffet thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3224
02:15:35.451 --> 02:15:36.650
<v Speaker 4>You've got to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

3225
02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:39.310
<v Speaker 3>sure thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will for sure.</v>

3226
02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Good luck with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now human campaigns,</v>

3227
02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>when they brought no food and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought no water,</v>

3228
02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:45.310
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mate,</v>

3229
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:48.520
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they go out there and they were</v>

3230
02:15:48.521 --> 02:15:52.600
<v Speaker 3>bathing in this fucking lake that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't realize had crocodiles.</v>

3231
02:15:52.601 --> 02:15:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were in up to their neck cooling</v>

3232
02:15:55.211 --> 02:15:59.350
<v Speaker 3>themselves off and then later on found</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the crocodiles at slipped into this</v>

3233
02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:01.870
<v Speaker 3>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they easily could have gotten eaten.</v>

3234
02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:02.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3235
02:16:02.531 --> 02:16:06.100
<v Speaker 3>these are some of the biggest fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles in the world that live right</v>

3236
02:16:06.101 --> 02:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

3237
02:16:08.850 --> 02:16:11.370
<v Speaker 4>I was hunting or with another body in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia and we were hunting in an area</v>

3238
02:16:11.371 --> 02:16:15.120
<v Speaker 4>that crocodiles and everyday we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had to cross a couple of little areas</v>

3239
02:16:15.121 --> 02:16:20.121
<v Speaker 4>that had water and I just didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it because I'm not like I'm</v>

3240
02:16:20.191 --> 02:16:21.540
<v Speaker 4>not around crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3241
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.810
<v Speaker 4>And he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the first day he didn't really</v>

3242
02:16:24.811 --> 02:16:26.910
<v Speaker 4>worry about it too much because he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after we crossed,</v>

3243
02:16:26.911 --> 02:16:27.271
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3244
02:16:27.271 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not with you tomorrow and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>cross here,</v>

3245
02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:32.380
<v Speaker 4>make sure you throw a bunch of rocks in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the water right there to make sure</v>

3246
02:16:32.381 --> 02:16:34.450
<v Speaker 4>there's no crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if they,</v>

3247
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:37.480
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a human passes by an area where</v>

3248
02:16:37.481 --> 02:16:39.280
<v Speaker 4>there's crocodiles over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>

3249
02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:43.870
<v Speaker 4>they pattern them and they will sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and wait for that human to cross</v>

3250
02:16:43.871 --> 02:16:45.760
<v Speaker 4>again and get ya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

3251
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:49.630
<v Speaker 4>So they're super intelligent hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what they do.</v>

3252
02:16:49.810 --> 02:16:52.700
<v Speaker 4>They actually wait for like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a rabbit going by everyday</v>

3253
02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:54.490
<v Speaker 4>or human or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dog,</v>

3254
02:16:54.491 --> 02:16:56.590
<v Speaker 4>a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they will sit there and wait just</v>

3255
02:16:56.591 --> 02:16:59.200
<v Speaker 4>underwater and when you go by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when they strike.</v>

3256
02:16:59.201 --> 02:17:03.730
<v Speaker 4>So such an efficient animal to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they could just stay under water</v>

3257
02:17:03.731 --> 02:17:06.850
<v Speaker 4>for hours without breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They slow their heart rate down like a</v>

3258
02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:08.470
<v Speaker 4>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a minute or something stupid.</v>

3259
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a place in northwestern</v>

3260
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Australia where the waves are really</v>
<v Speaker 4>good and in that area there's a ton.</v>

3261
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:21.160
<v Speaker 4>A ton of great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tiger sharks and ocean.</v>

3262
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Saltwater crocodiles swim in the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 4>for miles.</v>

3263
02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:27.640
<v Speaker 4>They swim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fight the sharks.</v>

3264
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 4>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck everything.</v>

3265
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole God.</v>

3266
02:17:32.231 --> 02:17:33.700
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3267
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:36.460
<v Speaker 4>They swim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine being in the fucking water in a</v>

3268
02:17:36.461 --> 02:17:39.520
<v Speaker 4>canoe and you look over and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something bigger than you can do and</v>

3269
02:17:39.521 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a dinosaur.</v>

3270
02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's swimming in the water and it wants</v>

3271
02:17:42.131 --> 02:17:43.150
<v Speaker 4>to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hungry.</v>

3272
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh my on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll Australia's a wild ass place,</v>

3273
02:17:47.921 --> 02:17:51.370
<v Speaker 4>but it really is beautiful and crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild.</v>

3274
02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Seems like New Zealand's a better spot</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3275
02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:57.790
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand doesn't have any of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and I'm from a place like New</v>

3276
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.931
<v Speaker 4>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3277
02:17:57.931 --> 02:17:59.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no snakes.</v>

3278
02:17:59.690 --> 02:18:01.600
<v Speaker 4>We don't have deadly spiders or anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3279
02:18:01.601 --> 02:18:06.190
<v Speaker 4>And when I go to Australia</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get so freaked out about the snakes,</v>

3280
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:09.370
<v Speaker 4>so freaked out and have those brown</v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes it kill you instantly.</v>

3281
02:18:09.430 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 4>I almost stepped on one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

3282
02:18:13.150 --> 02:18:16.750
<v Speaker 4>I literally fuck you in green tree</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get me to come to your house.</v>

3283
02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.550
<v Speaker 4>My partner was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My foot was up,</v>

3284
02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:19.561
<v Speaker 4>my left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

3285
02:18:19.561 --> 02:18:23.730
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was walking through this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this grass called tussock and it was in,</v>

3286
02:18:24.210 --> 02:18:25.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam was like,</v>

3287
02:18:25.151 --> 02:18:27.850
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to see a snake at</v>
<v Speaker 4>this time of year.</v>

3288
02:18:27.850 --> 02:18:28.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like winter time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3289
02:18:28.930 --> 02:18:30.870
<v Speaker 4>So they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all down,</v>

3290
02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:32.170
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hibernating.</v>

3291
02:18:32.171 --> 02:18:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm walking by myself,</v>

3292
02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:36.760
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I almost put my foot down and I</v>

3293
02:18:36.761 --> 02:18:40.020
<v Speaker 4>looked down as a coiled up brown snake</v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

3294
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:43.180
<v Speaker 4>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was out sunning himself and almost</v>

3295
02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:45.580
<v Speaker 4>stepped right on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those red belly black snakes.</v>

3296
02:18:45.630 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 4>The thing was that thing called right</v>
<v Speaker 4>past me.</v>

3297
02:18:47.651 --> 02:18:49.570
<v Speaker 4>One day I was with my other buddy and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't move.</v>

3306
02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even say a word.</v>

3307
02:19:07.991 --> 02:19:10.720
<v Speaker 4>I was looking around for the deer side</v>

<v Speaker 4>completely still.</v>

<v Speaker 4>completely deadly.</v>

3313
02:19:23.050 --> 02:19:25.450

<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>

3361
02:21:29.061 --> 02:21:30.380
<v Speaker 3>It looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I would definitely take it all day long</v>

3364
02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:35.720
<v Speaker 3>for that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was 30 yards away,</v>

3365
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:37.810
<v Speaker 3>smoke it with expandables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3366
02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Like a rage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3367
02:21:40.430 --> 02:21:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Do you use a fixed head broadhead or</v>
<v Speaker 3>these expandable.</v>

3368
02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:45.350
<v Speaker 3>So look at the size of that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

3369
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:50.300
<v Speaker 3>That's bigger than the one I've run</v>
<v Speaker 3>across over at least semi.</v>

3370
02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:52.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a big ass snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3371
02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:53.573
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

3372
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use fix heads mainly.</v>

3373
02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use like these little vpa heads,</v>

3374
02:21:58.210 --> 02:22:01.490
<v Speaker 3>a vantage point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Archery makes these like little two</v>

3375
02:22:01.491 --> 02:22:02.840
<v Speaker 3>bladed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3376
02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:05.680
<v Speaker 3>same one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3377
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:08.510
<v Speaker 3>but they're all machined out of one</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of steel.</v>

3378
02:22:08.511 --> 02:22:10.130
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very strong.</v>

3379
02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.110
<v Speaker 3>They're very like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3380
02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:12.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a super reliable heads and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly.</v>

3381
02:22:12.951 --> 02:22:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big debate in the archery</v>

3382
02:22:16.191 --> 02:22:19.430
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Expandable broadheads versus fixed head.</v>

3383
02:22:19.431 --> 02:22:23.870
<v Speaker 3>What we're talking about folks is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>expandables as they go in these blades</v>

3384
02:22:23.871 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 3>open up on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like a mechanical</v>

3385
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.130
<v Speaker 4>blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes they fail and they break</v>

3386
02:22:29.131 --> 02:22:31.140
<v Speaker 4>off when they hit ribs and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3387
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:32.023
<v Speaker 4>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3388
02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 4>there's some animals that they're better</v>
<v Speaker 4>on I think.</v>

3389
02:22:34.690 --> 02:22:38.580
<v Speaker 4>But I've used rages a bit and I've had</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good luck with them actually.</v>

3390
02:22:38.670 --> 02:22:40.100
<v Speaker 4>I've had friends that were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

3391
02:22:40.250 --> 02:22:44.010
<v Speaker 4>I can't do the rage thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've had super good luck with them</v>

3392
02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 4>where they're making hybrids now to look</v>
<v Speaker 4>as he makes a hybrid and then then</v>

3393
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:48.371
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3394
02:22:48.371 --> 02:22:53.371
<v Speaker 4>so grave diggers where it's a fixed head</v>
<v Speaker 4>blade and then two other blades open up</v>

3395
02:22:53.611 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 4>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is actually probably even better</v>

3396
02:22:55.411 --> 02:22:57.960
<v Speaker 4>than just a regular fixed blade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It totally depends on what you're</v>

3397
02:22:57.961 --> 02:23:00.930
<v Speaker 4>hunting too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like where I live on access to</v>

3398
02:23:00.931 --> 02:23:04.220
<v Speaker 4>your access to deer were brought from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sri Lanka there.</v>

3399
02:23:04.330 --> 02:23:09.030
<v Speaker 4>They're from Sri Lanka</v>
<v Speaker 4>and India.</v>

3400
02:23:09.090 --> 02:23:14.090
<v Speaker 4>So there's like an Asian deer and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>main Predator in like in like Borneo and</v>

3401
02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 4>we're.</v>

3402
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.250
<v Speaker 4>And we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're there from in a,</v>

3403
02:23:17.370 --> 02:23:19.680
<v Speaker 4>in all those countries there was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bengal tiger.</v>

3404
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:21.720
<v Speaker 4>So if you look up the history of access</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

3405
02:23:21.721 --> 02:23:25.080
<v Speaker 4>it's mean Predator for thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years of Bengal tiger.</v>

3406
02:23:25.310 --> 02:23:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have,</v>

3407
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:30.120
<v Speaker 4>they have like a vertical leap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a crazy vertical leap and they run</v>

3408
02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:32.790
<v Speaker 4>like super fast and they always jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're Arielle right?</v>

3409
02:23:32.791 --> 02:23:34.830
<v Speaker 4>They always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they always jumped the string.</v>

3410
02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when they jumped the string to you,</v>

3411
02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:40.400
<v Speaker 4>aim low so they ducked down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You catch them when they're tough thing</v>

3412
02:23:40.410 --> 02:23:41.400
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super low,</v>

3413
02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:44.700
<v Speaker 4>and if they're alert most of the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>you came off their body.</v>

3414
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:48.600
<v Speaker 4>So if they don't see you and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>see you release your Arrow,</v>

3415
02:23:48.601 --> 02:23:50.750
<v Speaker 4>do you still aim low?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aim Low.</v>

3416
02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:53.820
<v Speaker 4>The sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them react down.</v>

3417
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:55.260
<v Speaker 4>They react like super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super,</v>

3418
02:23:55.261 --> 02:23:56.720
<v Speaker 4>hyper fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>

3419
02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:57.360
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3420
02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:00.060
<v Speaker 4>The reason I brought it up is because</v>
<v Speaker 4>those mechanicals are really good,</v>

3421
02:24:00.450 --> 02:24:04.530
<v Speaker 4>especially on access to here because</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you make a perfect shot,</v>

3422
02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:06.020
<v Speaker 4>like a fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just incredible archer,</v>

3423
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:08.280
<v Speaker 4>like someone like Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 40 yards,</v>

3424
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:10.650
<v Speaker 4>you're just rock solid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not nervous.</v>

3425
02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:14.520
<v Speaker 4>You can make the perfect shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That animal could be completely spin</v>

3426
02:24:14.521 --> 02:24:17.310
<v Speaker 4>around into one 80 and you hit him in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other side.</v>

3427
02:24:17.311 --> 02:24:19.620
<v Speaker 4>He hit him in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you can make a gut shot even</v>

3428
02:24:19.621 --> 02:24:21.400
<v Speaker 4>though you made a perfect shot just</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they move.</v>

3429
02:24:21.401 --> 02:24:25.220
<v Speaker 4>So in those kinds of situations I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3430
02:24:25.410 --> 02:24:27.780
<v Speaker 4>biggest boundable is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is really good,</v>

3431
02:24:27.781 --> 02:24:29.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you hit him badly,</v>

3432
02:24:29.370 --> 02:24:31.350
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things cut giant holes,</v>

3433
02:24:31.351 --> 02:24:32.040
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3434
02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:35.300
<v Speaker 4>They cut giant holes and cam shot a bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a,</v>

3435
02:24:35.310 --> 02:24:38.070
<v Speaker 4>one of those grave diggers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those hybrid blades would,</v>

3436
02:24:38.071 --> 02:24:41.700
<v Speaker 4>has a large fixed blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then as these two really big</v>

3437
02:24:41.701 --> 02:24:45.420
<v Speaker 4>expandables that go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an inch and three quarters and it just</v>

3438
02:24:45.421 --> 02:24:47.610
<v Speaker 4>opened up a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a 300 win mag.</v>

3439
02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a huge holes.</v>

3440
02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.410
<v Speaker 4>The difference in the bear rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they still get the crazy</v>

3441
02:24:52.411 --> 02:24:53.150
<v Speaker 4>penetration.</v>

3442
02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he's shooting 80 pounds to and you</v>

3443
02:24:56.191 --> 02:24:58.590
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with those really thin,</v>

3444
02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:02.190
<v Speaker 4>a Fmj deep six injection arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What uh,</v>

3445
02:25:02.191 --> 02:25:05.430
<v Speaker 4>what kind of boat are you shooting with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have Mathews Halon six of those</v>

3446
02:25:05.431 --> 02:25:07.170
<v Speaker 4>are great posts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what Ben has.</v>

3447
02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:11.510
<v Speaker 4>St Mary quiet silent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the six is the one with the sixth and</v>

3448
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:12.510
<v Speaker 4>spray site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

3449
02:25:12.511 --> 02:25:13.560
<v Speaker 4>So it's a little jumpy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3450
02:25:13.561 --> 02:25:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Turbo Cam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a five or six and a seven.</v>

3451
02:25:16.501 --> 02:25:18.420
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the five is like the junk,</v>

3452
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:19.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fastest one,</v>

3453
02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:25.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably not easy to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like with all speed beaus I think the</v>

3454
02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:27.340
<v Speaker 4>shorter the brace height,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Fascia they'd go,</v>

3455
02:25:27.350 --> 02:25:28.620
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3456
02:25:28.690 --> 02:25:31.210
<v Speaker 4>my understanding is that I'm not like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Super Archer guidance.</v>

3457
02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my understanding is that the longer</v>

3458
02:25:35.081 --> 02:25:38.650
<v Speaker 4>that brace height in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the more forgiving the is to shoot.</v>

3459
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:41.710
<v Speaker 4>We just got into technical geek talk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in their cars right now.</v>

3460
02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Fast forward to the next subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3461
02:25:45.791 --> 02:25:47.330
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I geek out on Bozeman.</v>

3462
02:25:47.350 --> 02:25:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I kick out on all sorts of gear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3463
02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of all the,</v>

3464
02:25:52.121 --> 02:25:54.670
<v Speaker 4>like the little tiny things that make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

3465
02:25:54.671 --> 02:25:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you should avoid and make good bows.</v>

3466
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:59.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3467
02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Are Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Defining carbon defiant.</v>

3468
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:04.960
<v Speaker 4>Eighty pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fucking flame thrower,</v>

3469
02:26:04.961 --> 02:26:06.010
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3470
02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:07.000
<v Speaker 4>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

3471
02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:09.490
<v Speaker 4>They fling some arrows out fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3472
02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:12.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm just so obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I practice almost too much.</v>

3473
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:16.060
<v Speaker 4>I really have a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about the new studio</v>

3474
02:26:16.061 --> 02:26:18.460
<v Speaker 4>that we're setting up or it has a 50</v>
<v Speaker 4>yard indoor range.</v>

3475
02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.000
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why I got it coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>back over next time I bring my belt.</v>

3476
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:26.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so do you have anything planned that</v>

3477
02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:28.180
<v Speaker 4>you're really looking forward to and he.</v>

3478
02:26:28.270 --> 02:26:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Big Hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're planning?</v>

3479
02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:31.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have nothing to promote on.</v>

3480
02:26:31.391 --> 02:26:32.730
<v Speaker 4>The show has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>If they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>

3485
02:26:37.061 --> 02:26:38.230
<v Speaker 4>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's better.</v>

3486
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:40.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not bad one way or another yet.</v>

3487

<v Speaker 4>I kinda just tweaked my back like,</v>

3550
02:29:00.991 --> 02:29:03.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about nine months ago and it was really</v>

3551
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3552
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I was doing a workout and it hurt it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What part of your back?</v>

3553
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:10.910
<v Speaker 4>My lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3554
02:29:11.450 --> 02:29:13.620
<v Speaker 4>I've got a machine in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to show you what's wrong.</v>

3555
02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:15.470
<v Speaker 4>We're done here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a reverse hyper.</v>

3556
02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3557
02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:17.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3558
02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:18.980
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard of them before?</v>

3559
02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use them a little bit.</v>

3560
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3561
02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:23.360
<v Speaker 4>they're the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really good if you can,</v>

3562
02:29:23.361 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 4>if you have a place for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should get a.</v>

3563
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:27.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking phenomenal piece of</v>
<v Speaker 4>machinery.</v>

3564
02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:29.450
<v Speaker 4>So I got really into crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was using,</v>

3565
02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:32.840
<v Speaker 4>I was using the reverse hyper a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3566
02:29:32.850 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

3567
02:29:33.981 --> 02:29:38.180
<v Speaker 4>was this before or after the injury?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like before and after.</v>

3568
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3569
02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:39.950
<v Speaker 4>Does it help?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reverse?</v>

3570
02:29:39.951 --> 02:29:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Hyper helps out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Helps stretch me out and loosen it up.</v>

3571
02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:44.990
<v Speaker 4>There's also some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have some decompression stuff in the</v>

3572
02:29:44.991 --> 02:29:47.570
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some different spinal decompression and</v>

3573
02:29:47.571 --> 02:29:49.460
<v Speaker 4>things that I could show you that will</v>
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>

3574
02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:53.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of an expert now in healing up</v>
<v Speaker 4>a back injury.</v>

3575
02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:59.140
<v Speaker 4>I had a pretty severe bulging disc issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Jitsu that my hand's numb.</v>

3576
02:29:59.270 --> 02:30:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3577
02:30:00.200 --> 02:30:01.730
<v Speaker 4>But now it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely.</v>

3578
02:30:01.731 --> 02:30:02.451
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3579
02:30:02.451 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any bolt at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had an MRI.</v>

3580
02:30:04.491 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 4>It's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had back issues.</v>

3581
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:09.290
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nine months ago I was training the</v>

3582
02:30:09.291 --> 02:30:11.690
<v Speaker 4>thing with the hat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the thing that happened is I was</v>

3583
02:30:11.691 --> 02:30:15.530
<v Speaker 4>training like really pretty seriously</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like got really into it,</v>

3584
02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:18.710
<v Speaker 4>got really excited about it and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>love training and it was like one of</v>

3585
02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:22.070
<v Speaker 4>those things I just love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I like five days a week I got really</v>

3586
02:30:22.071 --> 02:30:23.650
<v Speaker 4>like muscular throughout my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

3587
02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:28.550
<v Speaker 4>my hips and my quads and my core and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got super,</v>

3588
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:29.960
<v Speaker 4>super developed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3589
02:30:30.030 --> 02:30:32.930
<v Speaker 4>kind of like my muscles got like cables</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

3590
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:38.500
<v Speaker 4>and then I just had like a five month</v>
<v Speaker 4>period of time where I was just</v>

3591
02:30:39.021 --> 02:30:42.230
<v Speaker 4>traveling out of the country for like</v>
<v Speaker 4>five months and I just couldn't do the</v>

3592
02:30:42.231 --> 02:30:43.000
<v Speaker 4>same kind of workout.</v>

3593
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.650
<v Speaker 4>So I was in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really mellow workouts and kind of</v>

3594
02:30:45.651 --> 02:30:48.530
<v Speaker 4>not working out too much and then I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>home and it had like a month to get</v>

3595
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:51.620
<v Speaker 4>ready for winter and so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3596
02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:54.890
<v Speaker 4>ease back into the workout thing and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first workout I did my body just got</v>

3597
02:30:54.891 --> 02:30:58.760
<v Speaker 4>pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just locked up a tried to go just a</v>

3598
02:30:58.761 --> 02:31:01.520
<v Speaker 4>little too hard too quick or trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go really mellow,</v>

3599
02:31:01.521 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 4>but I was going relatively mellow</v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to what I was doing before,</v>

3600
02:31:04.911 --> 02:31:06.980
<v Speaker 4>but my body just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3601
02:31:06.981 --> 02:31:10.190
<v Speaker 4>it just was pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever fuck with yoga?</v>

3602
02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:12.260
<v Speaker 4>I Love Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

3603
02:31:12.261 --> 02:31:14.840
<v Speaker 4>I really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just the yoga classes around my house</v>

3604
02:31:14.841 --> 02:31:16.850
<v Speaker 4>or never the right time and I don't do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it by myself.</v>

3605
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:20.200
<v Speaker 4>Just get a DVD or youtube man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need a lot</v>

3606
02:31:20.210 --> 02:31:22.560
<v Speaker 3>of videos on youtube and you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's man.</v>

3607
02:31:22.561 --> 02:31:25.350
<v Speaker 3>That's been a saving grace for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a big help and like,</v>

3608
02:31:25.530 --> 02:31:30.120
<v Speaker 3>and also there's a lot of yoga exercises</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I didn't even realize they before I</v>

3609
02:31:30.121 --> 02:31:30.541
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3610
02:31:30.541 --> 02:31:34.170
<v Speaker 3>they act as a spinal decompression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stretch you out,</v>

3611
02:31:34.171 --> 02:31:35.640
<v Speaker 3>you feel your back pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>

3612
02:31:35.641 --> 02:31:37.950
<v Speaker 3>pop as you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing some of the stretches.</v>

3613
02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I actually really love Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking awesome,</v>

3614
02:31:40.471 --> 02:31:41.730

<v Speaker 3>I go to yoga classes.</v>

3615
02:31:41.731 --> 02:31:43.980
<v Speaker 3>My wife's super into yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things though,</v>

3616
02:31:43.981 --> 02:31:46.170
<v Speaker 3>like for a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially a manly surfer,</v>

3617
02:31:46.171 --> 02:31:48.180
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting type dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell people,</v>

3618
02:31:48.181 --> 02:31:49.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really into yoga.</v>

3619
02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you sucking dicks over there</v>

3620
02:31:50.461 --> 02:31:51.990
<v Speaker 3>and that yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're starting.</v>

3621
02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:57.600
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a good thing or a bull.</v>

3622
02:31:57.601 --> 02:32:01.800
<v Speaker 3>You're a bow hunter and you surf 50 foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>waves on paper.</v>

3623
02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:04.230
<v Speaker 3>You're a pretty fucking macho dude</v>
<v Speaker 3>fella.</v>

3624
02:32:04.380 --> 02:32:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you.</v>

3625
02:32:05.941 --> 02:32:07.290
<v Speaker 3>If you talked to anybody who knew me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3626
02:32:07.291 --> 02:32:09.090
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would never describe me as macho.</v>

3627
02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean macho like a in a dumb way</v>

3628
02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:13.410
<v Speaker 3>to walk into a yoga class is what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

3629
02:32:13.411 --> 02:32:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Of course you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but saying it like saying yoga to</v>

3630
02:32:16.801 --> 02:32:19.230
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying obviously I don't have a</v>

3631
02:32:19.231 --> 02:32:20.610
<v Speaker 3>problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it all the time,</v>

3632
02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:24.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying there's a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>preconceived notion about yoga that it's</v>

3633
02:32:24.961 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a hard thing to do.</v>

3634
02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:29.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a mailing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the most difficult</v>

3635
02:32:29.461 --> 02:32:31.800
<v Speaker 3>things to do that I have ever done that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks your ass.</v>

3636
02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3637
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:34.580

<v Speaker 3>Especially hot yoga is.</v>

3638
02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:38.610
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable how difficult it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife does this stuff called Buddhi</v>

3639
02:32:38.610 --> 02:32:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard that?</v>

3640
02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Buddhi Yoga.</v>

3641
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read a yoga,</v>

3642
02:32:41.310 --> 02:32:43.590
<v Speaker 3>like yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to kill me.</v>

3643
02:32:43.650 --> 02:32:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Yoga slash kind of simulate twerking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a dance yoga.</v>

3644
02:32:47.671 --> 02:32:50.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like high energy but like crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga poses,</v>

3645
02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:54.060
<v Speaker 3>but they like gnarly cardio too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the girl Jen who teaches the class</v>

3646
02:32:54.061 --> 02:32:56.760
<v Speaker 3>is bad ass and it's the gnarliest</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>

3647
02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:58.230
<v Speaker 3>I'd never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3648
02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Too much for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Buddhi Yoga?</v>

3649
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3650
02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:02.153
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it.</v>

3651
02:33:02.490 --> 02:33:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I knew I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

3652
02:33:04.441 --> 02:33:06.420
<v Speaker 3>This is Buddhi Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie found it already.</v>

3653
02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:09.750
<v Speaker 3>So this girls throwing like a back kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3654
02:33:09.751 --> 02:33:12.000
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely not what I'm talking</v>

3655
02:33:12.001 --> 02:33:13.020
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3656
02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:13.883
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every.</v>

3657
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:17.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Buddhi Yoga has an</v>
<v Speaker 3>official designation,</v>

3658
02:33:17.191 --> 02:33:19.530
<v Speaker 3>so I think a lot of people call their</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff Buddhi Yoga,</v>

3659
02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:22.950
<v Speaker 3>but the class and my wife does it will</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick your ass.</v>

3660
02:33:22.951 --> 02:33:25.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like really high energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

3661
02:33:25.081 --> 02:33:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Cardio and it's yoga too.</v>

3662
02:33:26.490 --> 02:33:29.430
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's twerking is a little bit.</v>

3663
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:32.490
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they play like little wayne and like</v>

3664
02:33:32.491 --> 02:33:34.710
<v Speaker 3>the gangster rap and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just go off,</v>

3665
02:33:34.711 --> 02:33:35.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3666
02:33:35.141 --> 02:33:37.040
<v Speaker 3>they get none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably more</v>

3667
02:33:38.830 --> 02:33:43.260
<v Speaker 3>my wife's much hotter than in her</v>
<v Speaker 3>booty.</v>

3668
02:33:43.261 --> 02:33:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Yoga with twerking plus little way</v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

3669
02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Anything that keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps stuff.</v>

3670
02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:52.440

<v Speaker 3>Shay in shape and nice and tight.</v>
